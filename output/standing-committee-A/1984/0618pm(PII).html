</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee is able to look gravely at a serious amendment. Like the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), I am not a natural optimist, but I am not as pessimistic as he appears to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: on a point of order, Mr. Knox. I seek your advice, as I am not too sure what the dress ought to be. I notice that there is a certain amount of alteration to the dress being worn by some members and staff and I wonder whether we all have to be in that particular dress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should understand that, though my eyesight is very good, I do not see those who are dressed in this strange garb.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If you were to sit here, Mr. Knox, you would be able to form a different impression.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot see them either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that it is a good job that Viscount Nelson was not a member of this Standing Committee.<br><br>
These four amendments vary in scale, but each of them seeks to add a touch of freedom and flexibility to the clause. Conservative Members may particularly approve of Amendment No. 50, as it merely deletes the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
word "such". The amendments relieve the otherwise oppressive insistence in the clause on the centralising control which is clearly the principal characteristic of the Governments approach to the matter. The agency has a power to make agreements with respect to pipelines, storage and participation, but only such as are approved by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Amendment No. 50, the mildest of the four, gives some flexibility to the agency, which otherwise could be seen as little better than a rubber stamp. As the Minister has already, before the Select Committee, on Second Reading and earlier in the deliberations of this Committee, paid considerable tribute to the merits of those who will staff the agency and has commended most warmly the people already appointed to serve on it, it is a great pity that they should not be allowed to exercise any indpendence of judgment or initiative of action: everything has to be referred to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
If we had more confidence in Ministers, the Department or the Secretary of State himself, such centralisation might be a little less offensive to us, but I am sorry to say that we do not have much faith in the Ministers in the Department of Energy, or any faith at all. Therefore, we think it highly inappropriate that so much power should be centralised in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The lack of confidence in Ministers and the Department does not surprise me. Certainly today they are skilled in the art of answering questions without in the least giving an answer. I do not doubt for one minute that the Minister will hear some direct and positive questions from my hon. Friend very shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. However, the Minister will be courteous, because he always is courteous, and he tends to reduce the sting of the flat and dreadful refusals that we receive. Nevertheless, he will probably not offer any proper justification for refusing even this very modest amendment, because the Government are utterly rigid, utterly inflexible, obsessed with the need to pursue their party's dogma and perhaps obsessed with the need to be utterly unresisting to the greed so obviously contained in so many of their speeches.<br><br>
I am glad at this point to welcome back the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr Skeet). We shall look forward to hearing him later. However, I have heard even the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North in energy debates in which he frequently takes part making speeches in favour of flexibility and freedom. I have heard the hon. Member who is the most senior Government Back Bench Member—on many occasions speaking in absolutely flat opposition to centralisation, which is what we are seeking to qualify here. I hope that the hon. Member will be consistent and will not only support it himself but will persuade one or two of his colleagues to do so.<br><br>
The Government's refusal of our Amentments might be acceptable if in other ways they had demonstrated at least a mild and modest degree of tolerance in the Committee, and if they had been concerned to take the whole Committee with them on the course to which they are dedicated. The rejection of our Amendments would be more acceptable if we had confidence that the ministers were sufficiently
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0191">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
possessed of energy and imagination that they could he relied upon to make wise and sound judgments. Unfortunately, that is not possible, not necessarily through any fault of theirs. We are now in the mid-term of Parliament; Ministers are often tired and exhausted because their civil servants make sure that every minute of their working day is filled with an exhaustive programme, so they cannot sit down and exercise calm judgment in matters of this sort. Therefore, it seems to us that to relieve them of some of their exhausting burdens we should allow some responsibility to accrue to the agency, rather than to have paper piling up on their desks, adding to the burdens they have to bear, particularly since those burdens are now compounded by the intense unpopularity of the Government. They are exceedingly unpopular and that must add to the stresses and strains of office and make it more difficult for Ministers to make good judgments, so Amendment No. 50 would seem to be appropriate.<br><br>
There is another reason why I think this Amendment is sensible. Some time ago—though I have never had an opportunity to refer to it before—I read about the penchant of the Secretary of State for Energy for breakfast meetings when he was Secretary of State in another Department. All the Ministers and everybody concerned were supposed to turn up at the crack of dawn to take part in ministerial meetings. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) and I—when I was PPS in the Department of the Environment—had ministerial meetings at lunchtime. We never had them at dawn or shortly afterwards. I think it is preposterous to have such arrangements. If these breakfast meetings still take place, quite clearly Ministers will, as a result of such an exhausting arrangement, lack the enthusiasm and drive needed to exercise proper judgement. Because they are incapable, too tired, too unpopular or too bogged down in detail to exercise a proper degree of judgment our Amendment would seem to present them with a heaven-sent opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Kevin Barron <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I went to a breakfast meeting held in Kent, and I found it most interesting. Nobody was there in evening dress on that occasion, as we see in the Committee this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) on this point. The Chairman has instructed me that I cannot see certain things which clearly my hon. Friend can. The Chairman is well aware that on several occasions in the Committee people have tried to lead me down paths of which you, Mr. Knox, disapprove. I will resist the temptation partly because I hope to carry with me the residual common sense that may possibly still exist among Conservative Members. I would like to ask hon. Gentlemen to look fairly at the Amendments, particularly Amendment No. 50.<br><br>
I know that some Conservative Members—though they are not necessarily in the Committee—are a little concerned about the Treasury's document on the control of nationalised industries. It is an instrument of centralisation such as Britain has probably never seen before. There are hon. Members in the Conservative
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
party who do not enthuse about this document, which comes out of the same stable as the text of clause 2, which confers every pettifogging little power on the Secretary of State. I would hope that Amendment No. 5(1. the most modest of our four Amendments, is one of which any intelligent Government must surely approve.<br><br>
Amendment No. 42 goes a little further. It deletes reference to the Secretary of State at a point in the Bill which might allow the initiative enjoyed by the agency to go a little further. It is the same principle as that which I have offered in support of Amendment No. 50.<br><br>
Amendment No. 44 could best be described as an invitation to the Committee to show just a little vision. The Minister would give the opportunity to the agency to operate with a degree of initiative, if the Amendment is accepted. One or two Conservative Members, in their biographies, if they are accurate—the biographies of Members of Parliament are not always accurate—claim to have had experience in management, in leadership in commerce and industry. If they have ever exercised responsibility, they will surely have had the experience that if people are given responsibility they will seek to exercise it effectively. All we are inviting the Minister to do in the Amendments is to give his creature—his agency—a little capacity to make the occasional decision itself, without having to go running, cap in hand, to the Dept to seek permission for even the most trifling thing. The Minister ought not to insist on this degree of centralisation; any competent manager or experienced leader in commerce would find that to be plain common sense. That is the kernel of our argument in support of these four Amendments. We are asking the Minister show a little common sense to ease his own burden. I accept that that may be an invitation for him to act selfishly, but a Minister is entitled to be a little selfish, given the burdens of office and the enormous unpopularity of the Government at the present time.<br><br>
We would recommend the Minister to accept Amendment No. 42, which would perhaps go a little far for him but which might please some Conservative Members who may have sympathy for it. I shall wait with interest to see whether the Minister is prepared to accept our invitation. It would give considerable delight to Opposition Members who are interested in an efficient and satisfactory agency, and I do not think it would cause any embarrassment to his hon Friends. If they have any agruments to advance in support of the Minister we should be pleased to hear them. I am delighted to move all four Amendments; I trust that at least one of them will be acceptable to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member can move only one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I start by disappointing the hon Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) in relation to Amendment No 42, to which he addressed the latter part of his remarks. Both Amendments No. 50 and No. 42—I will turn in a moment to Amendment No. 44 which contains the real substance of this group of Amendments—seek to delete words which are required for important technical reasons.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0192">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
If the two Amendments were carried, they would remove responsibility from the Secretary of State to determine which of the participation agreements entered into by the BNOC and transferred to the agency should continue to be given effect by the agency. The definition of participation agreements used in the Bill is that contained in the Participation Agreements Act 1978. This is, of course, a comprehensive definition.<br><br>
10.45 p.m.<br><br>
That definition embraces not only agreements which provide BNOC with options for access to up to 51 per cent. of the petroleum from a field or licensee; it includes some commercial agreements which do not contain options but oblige BNOC to purchase petroleum in any event.<br><br>
Since the policy which underlines clause 2 is that the agency should not, in the ordinary course, purchase petroleum under participation agreements but should retain the ability to do so in the event of security of supply being threatened, it is appropriate that the Secretary of State should be able to determine that certain agreements, although technically falling within the definition of participation agreements in clause 6, should not continue to be given effect by the agency, but should be included in the agency's realisation function under clause 4. Therefore, this provision has nothing to do with undermining the structure of participation, but has everything to do with the agency disengaging itself from commercial contracts which oblige it to trade in oil rather than provide it with options which could enable it to do so at a time of shortage. We have discussed the policy behind that and why we think it is inappropriate for the agency to continue trading in third party oil.<br><br>
Amendment No. 44 takes us to the heart of the Bill, and amendment No. 45 is simply consequential. If amendment No. 44 were accepted there would be little, if any, point in introducing the Bill. Perhaps we should pack up and go home, which may be why the hon. Gentleman has tabled this amendment. By trading in participation oil, the agency would become a carbon copy of BNOC. I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman has moved the amendment, but I have not been taken in by his soft words, because the legislation is to remove state involvement in trading. We have already fully discussed the issue, and I have not heard any fresh points which would cause me to change my view.<br><br>
Amendment No. 44 would also allow the agency to trade on its own account without any restriction. I apologise again for trailing my coat in relation to amendments Nos. 37, 38 and 51. We will discuss the precise extent of clause 2(1)(d)—the circumstances under which I believe it is appropriate for the agency to trade on its own account. If we agreed to that amendment it would take the guts out of what we are trying to do. I cannot recommend the acceptance of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 37, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
page 2, line 16, leave out from 'determine' to end of line 18.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:<br><br>
No. 38, in page 2, line 22, leave out from 'agreement' to end of line 24.<br><br>
No. 51, in page 2, line 18, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and, in particular, shall be prepared to buy petroleum from those companies whose total output from the United Kingdom Continental Shelf is no greater than 20,000 barrels a day.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hour is late so I shall be as brief as possible. The first reason for tabling the amendment, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet), was my genuine surprise at the existence of paragraph (d). I am uncertain as to why it has been included in the Bill, and it is partly to give my right hon. Friend the opportunity to explain that point that the amendment has been tabled.<br><br>
There are two roles foreseen for the agency. One is the taking of royalty oil and the other is the potential to take participation oil. Those two points seem to be covered by paragraphs (a) and (b). Paragraph (a) provides for the agency to carry out activities on behalf of the Crown with respect to petroleum held by the Crown. That would seem to cover royalty oil, since that passes to the Crown under the terms of the licence issued to any oil company.<br><br>
Paragraph (b) specifically deals with participation agreements, and paragraph (c) provides the agency with the necessary power to carry out the two roles mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b). If the agency is taking royalty oil or participation oil, I understand that it needs to be able to sell and possibly deal in oil, but I am puzzled as to why it should need to buy on its own account. Perhaps my right hon. Friend could give us some guidance on that point.<br><br>
To be frank, the second purpose of my amendment is as a wrecking amendment, in the sense that I am calling into question the agency's role in the taking of royalty oil. The effect of my amendment would be to make it impossible for it to take royalty oil in kind in the first place. House Members may ask why I should want that, and I rehearsed on Second Reading some of the argument why I thought it was dangerous for the Government to be involved in taking royalty in the form of oil.<br><br>
The British Government have suffered badly from being in the trading business through the existence of BNOC. It has involved the British Government in trying to fix the price of oil, which is futile. It has caused BNOC considerable losses, which have been picked up by the taxpayer and have been a matter of concern to this House, in particular to the Select Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox, I hope that the Minister has not fetched his hon. Friend to try to intimidate us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair. I cannot see anyone other than the members of the Committee present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The trading role of BNOC under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
Government policy has brought this country into potential conflict with OPEC quite needlessly on a number of occasions. The member states of OPEC are too important to offend unnecessarily, and one ought whenever possible to avoid giving offence. Every time BNOC has had to make a price decision there has been the potential for giving great offence.<br><br>
There has also been the potential for both destabilising the price of oil and destabilising OPEC. While it is not the Government's duty to stabilise OPEC or the oil price, the existence of BNOC has put us in peril of setting off a chain off events without due regard to the serious consequences.<br><br>
The Government recognises the dangers first to abolish BNOC and secondly that the agency should not normally exercise the participation agreements. So I am genuinely puzzled that none the less the Government have decided to take royalty in the form of oil, because it is in danger of trading in oil and in peril of all the things that went on while BNOC was in existence.<br><br>
The dangers may be reduced by not taking participation oil, but they are certainly not eliminated. I also find royalty in kind makes a big difference to this country's security of supply. The amount of oil being dealt with here is about 10 per cent. of the nation's supply. As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) pointed out, it is a reducing amount. I find it hard to take that seriously as a quantity that will affect our security of supply. I notice that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his statement to the House on 13 March, referred to the agency having the power to take royalty in kind. That seemed at that point to leave it open as to whether it would do so or not.<br><br>
It seems to me that the logical solution to the problem is that royalty should be taken not in kind but in cash. The difficulty that arises with this solution is that the money comes in at a different time if the royalty is taken in cash rather that in kind. When it is taken in kind, the oil is sold on 30-day terms and there is a continual flow of money from royalty to the Exchequer, whereas normally, if the royalty is taken in cash, the money does not become available until two months after the end of each six-month accounting period. There would therefore be a cash flow disadvantage, and an interest burden would arise from that worse cash flow position. I fully recognise, to, that it would be very difficult now for the Government to amend the terms under which royalty is payable in cash</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Government Whips should not be speaking to people in the Private Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—because the terms under which royalty oil is payable in kind or in cash are written into the licence. As I understand it, it would therefore require primary legislation to put this right, and one would be in the difficult position of legislating to change what are effectively documents of contract under which the oil companies operate.<br><br>
I make two suggestions to the Minister of State. He should consider simply sustaining the loss that would arise on taking the royalty in cash, because, although
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
the loss would be substantial, it would on the whole be a one-off event and it might be a burden worth bearing for the greatly reduced risk of being involved in the oil trading business. Another more palatable suggestion is that he should consider doing a deal with the oil companies, as there is the basis of a deal here. As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has pointed out, the oil companies are often keen to hold on to their own oil supplies because the oil has a value to them within their refining systems. Therefore, the basis of the deal would be that they would make payment on a monthly basis though they are not strictly required to do so under payment of royalty in cash under the terms of the licence. In return, they would have the benefit of the oil within their system. My right hon. Friend correct me on this, but I understand that some companies have indicated their willingness to pay in cash, provided that their oil remains within the system. One could make that a binding agreement by signed letters which would be binding on both parties.<br><br>
Finally, I wish to refer to amendment No. 51 in the name of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. He is raising an interesting point, which is whether the small oil companies will be left worse off by the disappearance of BNOC, the company that habitually lifted their oil for them. It is likely on the whole that small oil companies will find themselves in a less advantaged position by the disappearance of BNOC than they were before. But I cannot support the argument that a Government agency should continue in the role in order to help companies in the essentially commercial matter of how their oil is lifted and how they dispose of it. I might come towards some common ground with the hon. Minister in saying that I none the less think that it may be the opportunity for the Government to consider in broad terms, given that this is likely to be to the disadvantage of some of the smaller oil companies, what is now the general position of small oil companies—of course, I am worried in particular about British ones—within the oil scene. The rhetoric of the Government is always strongly in favour of small companies and particularly small British companies; one hears that again and again in speeches made by Ministers over many years, for example, to Brindex.<br><br>
11 p. m.<br><br>
Sometimes it seems that the policies themselves are not quite as friendly to the small companies as some of the rhetoric. When my right hon. Friend considers the Amendments, will he bear in mind the letter which he wrote to Mr. Roland Shaw of Britex last year, announcing that the Government would no longer allow the sale of very small units in fields such as Forties and Claymore. I well understand why the Government did not care for those sales, but they were none the less an important facility for small oil companies because they enabled them to establish a stream of production, which then enabled them to offset their exploration costs against a petroleum revenue tax liability which was arising on the production that they bought.<br><br>
The game in the North Sea is that there are a very large number of oil companies who have production and are therefore effectively paying only a small proportion of the cost of each well that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
drill—something like 25p in the pound—whereas there are small British companies which do not have production and they are paying for their wells at the rate of 100p in the pound. Here was a device whereby some of the smaller companies could get into the 25p-a-pound league instead of having to pay 100p. The closing of that door has been a serious blow to them.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend will recall, when he looks at the amendments, the changes that were made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget, which disallow the offsetting of onshore exploration expenditure against production offshore. That again is a very serious change from the point of view of the small oil companies, and it raises a number of questions. First, is it a good thing to have small companies in the North sea at all? The answer from the Government has traditionally always been emphatically yes to that question, and I believe it still is yes. But is there then an inconsistency between the avowed policy of the Government and some of the manifestations of the detail of their policy? Whatever one thinks on that point, is it not in any case rather unfair and difficult for the small oil companies to make changes in midstream?<br><br>
I hope, Mr. Knox, that I have not strayed too far from the point of the amendment in asking my right hon. Friend to look again at the broad range of conditions governing the circumstances of small oil companies in the North sea. While I would not wish to support the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Merthry Tydfil and Rhymney, I none the less understand that there is some point behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite refreshing to have a substantial speech from a Conservative Member. I disagreed with it but it was certainly interesting. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) is so opposed to our approach in the matter. He sees our approach as lacking virtue and he seems staggeringly horrified by clause 2(1)(d) to the point that he seems to be demanding, in a polite way, that the Minister retreat from this position. We see that as just a tiny remnant of the virtue which existed before the present Government came clumsily upon the scene, and for the hon. Gentleman to try to screw down the agency to a protracted expiry seems to me to be unwise.<br><br>
We believe that the agency should have the capacity to trade, and we are entirely at loggerheads with the hon. Gentleman. On the other hand, we have some sympathy with his desire to introduce a wrecking amendment. If the Bill were to be wrecked upon the hon. Gentleman's shoals, those shoals would meet with our approval and, while we disagree with his intention, his motive and his design, we have to applaud any attempt to wreck this dreadful Bill.<br><br>
However, the hon. Gentleman must accept that the Opposition feels that his unfair, almost slanderous attack on BNOC was quite outrageous. BNOC did incur loss, but it incurred loss in the national interest. It put itself in the same position as the Dutch boy who stuck his finger in the dyke. No doubt the dyke will burst one day and the Government and their supporters—whether they introduce wrecking amend-mends or not—will suffer under the deluge. But for the hon. Gentleman to attack BNOC was, as the Minister well knows, quite unfair, and I hope that the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
Gentleman will reconsider his position and at some time during the proceedings on the Bill withdraw his almost slanderous attack.<br><br>
During his speech the hon. Member for Enfield; Southgate referred to the important people in OPEC. He will recall that some of his hon. Friends appeared to be nodding in muted approval of this. We would remind the hon. Gentleman that if OPEC is important now, it will be a great deal more important in a few years' time when some of the larger fields such as Forties and Brent have been exhausted. One can only hope that the important men of OPEC will have some sympathy with the United Kingdom, even though the United Kingdom does not apparently respond to the importance of OPEC by an adequate degree of genuflection at present.<br><br>
The hon. Member also critical of our concern that there should be a continued involvement of the agency in BNOC's stead. He mocked and poured scorn upon the marginality of the matter, suggesting that 10 per cent. was not very important. Ten per cent., if a marginal influence, can sometimes be decisive. If the hon. Gentleman had 10 per cent. of the equity of some of the oil companies with which he may have sympathy, he would probably be quite happy not to be sitting here at this very late hour, or if he did it would not be for very long. Ten per cent. can be very significant, and 10 per cent. at a time of crisis could be very significant indeed. It is a pity that that 10 per cent. is spurned by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Therefore, while we welcome his assault upon the Bill, and we have some sympathy with his desire to see the Bill wrecked, he must accept that we have to be consistent to our beliefs, and we shall not be able to support either amendment No. 37 or 38. We shall, of course, listen with great attention to the colleague and henchman of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, his hon. Friend for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet), who will no doubt with to add words to his case. However, I do not think that even the persuasive powers of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire North, will persuade us to do other than vote against.<br><br>
I want to say a brief word about our amendment. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said that it was interesting, perhaps because be had some sympathy with our concern for the small companies. He did qualify and safeguard his position by suggesting that, while he shared our sympathy and could see some merit in our argument, it did not have the purity of ruthless monetarism which appears to be required before it would receive his wholehearted endorsement.<br><br>
We believe that amendment No. 51 is a wise amendment, and as the months or years pass it will be seen to be increasingly valuable, demonstrably virtuous, and of growing relevance. The years, the size of our oil take, and the diminishing size of the average field offshore, would make the matter of increasing relevance; So much so that I trust that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), with traditional emphasis upon the diminutive, will on this occasion be able to enthuse about the amendment. Even on the occasions when he has supported us, he has never yet done so with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends whose turn it is.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has never supported the Government with enthusiasm either. He has been absolutely even-handed in the modesty of the support that he has conferred on either side. But I hope that on this occasion—given, as I say, the traditional attachment to the diminutive among the people of Orkney—he will be able to forget the traditional gloom which surrounds the character of those who live in his constituency.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene, I shall be happy to give way. All I am saying is that inevitably the people of Orkney and Shetland are morose at this time of the year. They are morose at most time of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman should get back to the amendment. The attitudes of the people of Orkney and Shetland have nothing to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned here with the diminutive companies and the diminutive fields. They are of particular interest. If you consider for a moment, Mr. Knox, that over the centuries the people of Orkney and Shetland have always been attached to small things, such as Shetland ponies, Shetland sheepdogs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is being absurd. Perhaps he will get back to the amendment. If he has finished speaking to it, he can resume his seat. He must not make remarks about the people of Orkney and Shetland, nor indeed about the animals of Orkney and Shetland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see those in the Committee either, Mr. Knox. You are right and I shall not pursue that path, except to say that even the representative of Orkney and Shetland will on this occasion be willing to support our attachment to the small companies and small businesses which should command our sympathy and which commanded the residual sympathy even of a monetarist like the hon. Member of Enfield, Southgate, and may possibly elicit a gesture of support from any other Conservative Member who may seek to comment. I think that the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North will do so in a moment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 51 is a very wise amendment. I cannot be properly compared with amendments Nos. 37 and 38, even though it was properly attached to them in the selection for consideration. It is virtuous and sensible. It allows British development to take place. It shows concern for small businesses. The hon. Member professed a concern for small businesses. My constituents want to see small businesses grow and we are often pleased to hear comments from hon. Gentlemen, particularly from Ministers, who deliberately and frequently profess and attachment to small businesses. But, as I have been pointing out for the last three or four years, the typical small business of 1985 was a large business in 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is embarking on a general discussion about small businesses. Will he please confine himself to the amendment, which is rather more restricted than he is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
suggesting</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is, Mr. Knox, but we are so concerned to see economic growth that we shall take every opportunity to press the need to develop—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a discussion about economic growth; it is about fairly narrow amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has relevance to small businesses within the oil sector, Mr. Knox. Given the pervasive concern and influence of the oil sector on the economy generally, it is obvious that if small businesses can grow in the oil sector, there will be a development of small businesses in the oil sector and therefore in every other sector.<br><br>
11.15 p.m.<br><br>
We are well disposed to the idea of small businesses. They are very necessary and the Minister should take account of the point made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate. The Minister may share our view that the approach recommended by the hon. Member is not one that we could view with great sympathy, in so far as he is urging the Minister to assist small businesses to survive, we suggest that that would be wise. In a few years we shall be taking oil from very small fields, and the big companies which are eager to make furtive and secret deals with the Department of energy in 1985 may not want to know the United Kingdom. They may not be concerned about developing diminutive field near or not very far from Orkney and Shetland, west of the Hebrides or wherever. The Minister may then regret that in the middle 1980s we did not encourage small companies which might regard a small field—one of the crumbs to the big majors—as one which could be a useful source of development for their own business.It is a proper, sensible, and, we believe, a timely argument. It is an area in which this agency could play a useful part. It might play a part in an economic way and reduce the expenditure of the Department of Energy which would otherwise be directly incurred.<br><br>
There is merit in amendment No. 51, particularly with regard to developing small British companies. I am not terribly worried about developing small businesses abroad. What I find fearful is the prospect that other countries inside the Common Market or nearby might see a failure of the British Government to assist small British oil companies so that we have adequate capacity to develop small British oilfields, and that we shall watch our French and Dutch neighbours, even our Norwegian, Danish, German or Irish neighbours, deciding that the neglect of the British Government allowed them to encourage, support and sustain small businesses in their countries capable of moving in to extract oil form small fields in British waters. That would be a most reprehensible development, but if the Government are negligent in this matter it could take place. The hon Member for Enfield, Southgate did not take the argument as far as that, but he did recoginse that the argument exists and should command the Government's attention.<br><br>
I accept that the Government will be well disposed to amendments Nos. 37 and 38 but I trust that they will not entirely disregard the argument advanced by the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate in support of small businesses.<br><br>
Once again we shall be pessimistic about the Ministers response to amendment No. 51, but I hope that the Ministers response to some of the arguments advanced in the debate will not he such a cause for dejection as some of the answers that he has made to earlier amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To put the record straight, my constituents are not morose at the moment. The last ones whom I met were reasonably ebullient. They were members of the Orkney Liberal executive, and perhaps some of that ebullience has rubbed off on me because I shall with some enthusiasm greet the amendment designed to give help to small oil companies.<br><br>
When the initial announcement was made of the abolition of the British National Oil Corporation, there was some outcry from the small companies that that corporation had been a useful agency through which they were able to trade their oil. The Minister should tell the Committee, even if this amendment is not satisfactory, what steps have been taken and what guarantees and reassurances he can give us about the future of small oil companies which were so heavily dependent on the British National Oil Corporation.<br><br>
I am sure that amendments No. 37 and 38 are meant to go together, but one could split them. I could not support No. 37, but No. 38, which would remove the requirement for the Secretary of State's consent for the exercise of the power
<br><blockquote><p>"to buy, sell or otherwise deal in petroleum on its own account".</p></blockquote>
might well be worthy of support. The Minister might argue, as he attempted to do on the last group of amendments, that that would rock the heart out of the Bill, though I respectfully disagree with him on that. We still have in place clause 2(2)(a), which requires the Secretary of State's consent
<br><blockquote><p>"for the exercise of any option or the making of any election… under a participation agreement".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, any buying or selling of petroleum by the new agency could relate only to royalty oil which it had acquired through royalties in kind and not to oil which it received from a participation agreement, unless the Secretary of State gave his consent.<br><br>
There are reasons why we should prefer the Secretary of State not to be involved. The hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) rebutted the criticism of BNOC made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) and said that BNOC could not solely be blamed for the losses which were made. Many Opposition Members believe that the unseen hand of Government was responsible for the prices that were set, either for Treasury reasons or because of pressure from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which led to the losses ultimately sustained.<br><br>
The record of the Secretary of State's interference, whether admitted or concealed, was not necessarily good. If the new agency is able to trade in such small amounts as it does have, I would wish to see trading from the smaller oil companies. It is far better that it does so free of the Secretary of State's hand.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T.H.H. Skeet <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the report on high energy particle physics, I feel that we should take note of the amendment. The amendment seeks to delete
<br><blockquote><p>"to buy, sell or otherwise deal in petroleum on its own account".</p></blockquote>
"Petroleum", of course, means natural gas, oil or petroleum products, which is extremely broad.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Minister has considered this point. He is a good Minister and a good Conservative. We have now had the chance of forming two Governments, and I personally believe that we shall have the chance of forming a third. But the time must come, perhaps in about 10 years, when we may not be in Government. If the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) took over then, he could implement the powers and bring back BNOC in its full force, simply because of the framework provided by the Minister.<br><br>
It is rather surprising that nobody else on the Committee has mentioned the fact that the Conservative Government, in their privatising efforts, have overlooked the fact that that could happen under a future Government. Perhaps the argument is, "If that is going to happen, it must be in due course".<br><br>
It is worth considering what has been the course of operations. In 1975 we set up BNOC. The next step, by a later amendment, was to hive off all its production assets in the North sea, and in this Bill we have decided to take further powers, leaving it with virtually nothing—simply to run pipelines and maintain the agreements.<br><br>
Perhaps the Committee will consider the need for the clause, whether authorised or not. BNOC, as presently constituted—or the new agency—has no refinery capacity in the United Kingdom. There are roughly 20 UK refineries. It has no interest in any one of them. It has no crude oil production. All it has is a right to the royalty oil, which my hon. Friend has said could be sold. It could perhaps be sold outright to the leading companies, which would be only too glad to take it up. Alternatively, it could be sold under contract abroad. BNOC has no distribution network in the United Kingdom. Why does it want the opportunity to trade it off, and petroleum products? What is even worse, it could become the creature of Government.<br><br>
I would not think for one moment of anticipating a later amendment, but I shall make a passing reference. Clause 5 enables the Government to give a specific direction. This would make BNOC a creature of Government. That is the last thing that I would wish, because, on page 8, the 1984 report from the British National Oil Company says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation considered that its own commercial interests could best be protected by a reduction in term prices".</p></blockquote>
A little lower down it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Her Majesty's Government… decided to continue the then-existing contract prices."</p></blockquote>
Lower down again it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation's freely tradeable crude oil was being sold on the spot market. Substantial losses resulted."</p></blockquote>
On the advice given by Government, losses were incurred.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just been praising it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman need not get too excited. He supports clause 5 of the Bill. One reason why I do not want paragraph (d) to be included in the Bill is that it makes the agency the creature of Government, and a Labour Government could deprive its resources in any way they pleased and make it do the same thing—run losses up to extreme heights, which could be very dangerous. I hope that the Minister will consider that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman done any calculations in the last year in relation to these so-called losses to great heights or looked at the revenue that went to the Treasury from the prices being as high as £86 million?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that the money lost would not be retrieved. The Treasury says, of course, that the money that it lost on the one hand it is retrieving on the other, but it did not all come back. In any case, it is very unsatisfactory for a state corporation to make extensive losses and to suffer demoralisation among its staff. But I am on a narrow argument here which I must not pursue further.<br><br>
Another interesting point has apparently been overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is only half standing, but if he would like me to sit down, I shall be only to glad to answer his question if I can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only would I like the hon. Gentleman to sit down; I should like him to change what he is talking about. We are talking about privatisation and the giving away of national assets. What will happen if the multinationals take complete control and they charge the market price that the hon. Gentleman holds up as a god? What effect will that have on our balance of payments? We could not afford to purchase what is rightfully ours, yet the hon. Gentleman wishes to give it away to the multinationals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman betrays considerable ignorance on this matter. It is not that the multinationals have control; the state operations have controls, and that is OPEC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: OPEC is endeavouring to maintain a world price. It is not having any great success at present, but as an earlier speaker said—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall carry on with my speech. The price of oil was well over $13 a barrel. OPEC decided that it would have to reduce it over the course of time. One sees in today's Financial Times that the spot price for Arab Light, is $26.75 per barrel and the price for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
Brent Blend $26. It has fallen a long way from the figure at which OPEC thought it was going to be stabilised some months ago. Therefore, it is not a question of the oil companies fleecing the market and making—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'> rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. I shall continue my speech, because I am keeping to the argument which I feel should be made.<br><br>
There would be a considerable defect in the Bill if these powers were to be maintained. Is it not extraordinary that the Minister should be asked to exercise his powers under clause 2(2)(b), when all the borrowing powers were swept away by sections 5 to 8 of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975, which deals with borrowing, loans and guarantees, and when, the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, also dealing with BNOC, section 7, which governs borrowing power, has also been swept away? The Government could not in fact exercise the powers that they have in mind, because the corporation will have no money with which to make its trading arrangements.<br><br>
11.30p.m.<br><br>
Have the Minister and his advisers considered that? Of course, if they decided to exercise this power, the Government would have to come to Parliament again, and Parliament would have to give them the necessary powers to discharge their new role as an agency. Therefore, the appropriate thing for the Minister to do today is to leave out the provision altogether and to bring it in when the Government legislate afresh.<br><br>
It has been argued—I think it is a point of some significance—that we must consider security of supply. The Opposition have raised this point and the Minister dealt with it on Second Reading. He has said that a surplus is available at present, which is not likely to be absorbed for some time. Domestic demand works out at 1.4 milion barrels a day and production from the North sea at 2.7 million barrels a day. It is extraordinary that there is no problem of security because the marketing arrangement in 1984 worked in this way: the UK refineries received 34 per cent. of the oil and 66 per cent. went abroad, largely to the EEC, a small quantity to the United States-12 per cent .—and 10 per cent. to non-EEC countries. Therefore, there is no problem of security of supply, nor is one likely to arise, because the Government have ample safeguards under the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a persistent devil, but on this occasion I shall give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can shut my eyes and imagine the hon. Gentleman saying exactly the same thing about security of supply when there was a surplus of oil in the late 1960s. Lo and behold, the dictators in the oil countries in the Middle East show what power can do in the hands of a small, motivated group. How can the hon. Gentleman guarantee supplies when the oil is beyond our control? He cannot.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to take this seriously as members of the Committee, and it is right that one should. I am trying to put the arguments in which I could conceive a future Government being in some difficulties, wanting to know which way to turn. If I felt for one moment that they had insufficient powers to deal with the situation, I should come to the conclusion that an agency of this nature with these powers was required. It is implied that if paragraph (d) is kept, the agency has the right to deal in petroleum on its own account, to buy and sell large quantities and to put an abundant supply aside as inventory, which, if it built up stocks, could be an insulation in times of difficulty, but that is not the case.<br><br>
I must persuade the Minister that in an emergency he has the safeguards to deal with the situation. He does not want this provision. it can be quite wisely eliminated. I shall go through it extremely briefly, as I do not want to hold up the Committee much longer. But when I hear from the hon. Gentleman about animals from the Shetland Islands I become rather surprised, and I feel that it is high time that a little sane argument was introduced.<br><br>
The safeguards in an emergency I tabulate as few in number. The Minister has the powers of the Energy Act 1976; he has full authority under the petroleum regulations to develop production programmes and control the yield of output under schedule 5 (14)(15); he has power over the disposal of petroleum; he has assurances from oil companies over future supplies; he has all the trigger mechanisms from the IEA and the EC; and through storage he can build up stocks. This is a very serious point. If he is to retain these powers, does he think an agency can stabilise the situation in the United Kingdom more successfully than the companies are doing at present? I agree that the situation in world markets is rather mercurial.<br><br>
In 1973 the price of oil rose from roughly $2 to $12 a barrel. BNOC was not then in operation. It was formed in 1975. Then came the big test in 1979-80 when the price took off. Little contribution was made by BNOC. It was a trading concern, it could buy and sell oil, it could distribute it on the market, it could export the oil, but its contribution to the stability of the market was hopeless. It had power to control stocks which it did not do to the right quantity. Therefore, it is a pity that the Minister considered including the powers on misconceived grounds.<br><br>
It is only right that I should bring up these points. I could have gone on longer, but that is not my purpose. This is the Committee stage of the Bill and I wanted to bring up some of the arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is now being as irrelevant as the hon. Gentleman for Wentworth was about what happened in Orkney and Shetland. The hon. Gentleman should discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. I would appreciate your tolerance, for while the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North keeps talking he is answering the case put forward by</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been keeping to the argument on the amendment. The amendment is to delete a right which can be inducted by the Minister if he brings in the power to buy, sell, or otherwise deal in petroleum on its own account. I am surprised that the pertinence of my remarks cannot be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is surely not querying a decision by the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not querying a decision; I am making an observation. I can provide an argument but I cannot provide a reason.<br><br>
Amendment No. 51 is interesting. It was argued that the Opposition were concerned about small traders. People in the City, considered this, and the promoters of the venture, Fielding, Newson, Smith and the County Bank, formed a scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme collapsed because they could not get the requisite number of people together. However, they indicated the other day that if this should operate—because they realised that a co-operation could be available if BNOC was not going to operate they would remain in the background ready to come forward.<br><br>
I dare say that the major oil companies dealing with the same quantity of oil on the market would be able to buy up all the oil as and when it becomes available. This is an everyday occurance in Texas, where there are many small producers. This is bought up by major refiners and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose.</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way to the hon. Gentleman. I have tried to accelerate my speech and it is only right that I should deal adequately with the points raised.<br><br>
The small producers in the United States sell to the major refiners and are paid a reasonable price determined by world prices. If the spot prices are indicated, there is no justification for the Minister to maintain the provision in clause 2(1)(d). He has not got the powers to support it and could delete it. I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate will ask the Committee to vote, and if I am the only person to vote for it and it is negatived, I am prepared to be in that position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a ringing challenge. I knew there was something missing in our Committee earlier; it was the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). He has now given us his advice and the Opposition welcome him back. I am not sure whether one or two of his hon. Friends are too glad to see the hon. Gentleman in full flow. We have had an interesting debate and I do not want to cast any gloom over the frivolity of some of the observations, but some aspects of the amendments are worthy of further comment. We shall try one other test in this Committee: we shall see how long it takes a Standing Committee to wilt a red rose or two. I wonder how long it will take—hours or minutes? I do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think red roses have anything to do with the amendments under consideration.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman concluded his speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I thought my hon. Friend wanted me to give way.<br><br>
Before we address ourselves to the arguments deployed by the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) and the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) in their two amendments, I remind the Minister that he decided to use this group of amendments as a sweeper-up for a number of unresolved responses to previous debates. He said he would deal with all those issues when he replies to these three amendments. I remind him what we expect from him a previous debate in which we discussed to what extent the powers sought under the amendment could enhance the role of trading and managing royalty oil, in accordance with his reference to this subsection of clause 2 in his Second Reading speech. He promised to comment on that when he replied to this collection of amendments. Secondly, he promised to deal with the whole question of the handling and trading of royalty oil, which is in a bit of a mess. Even BNOC was finding some aspects of trading and managing royalty oil a bit of a mess, partly as a result of this curious business of the six-month chargeable period.<br><br>
11.45 p.m.<br><br>
I raised with the Minister whether one of the simplest ways to overcome the problems would be to adopt the Norwegian practice in dealing with royalty oil and have a right for a roll-over period of, say, three months outside the six months chargeable period in order that royalty oil could be managed and traded more sensibly and reasonably. Those two issues are outstanding from previous debates, and the hon. Gentleman said that he would reply to them when he came to these amendments.<br><br>
I want to address my next remarks to our own amendment, which attracted the interest of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo). I will take up one or two of the points which he raised in the context of the small British oil company in the North sea and its various problems at the moment and the relationship between those problems and Government policy.<br><br>
First, however, I should like to identify the type of operation, the type of company, the type of oil licensee that we are trying to help in the amendment. We put down the figure of 20,000 barrels a day. We do not have any fixation about this figure, but we took it as a classic example of a range, from a very small amount to about 20,000 barrels a day, of the small licensee which has a right, through its equity ownership in parts of some of these licences, to up to 20,000 barrels of oil per day.<br><br>
Let me identify for the hon. Gentleman the sort of concerns arising here. In the Piper and Claymore fields, there are several existing fee deals—commercial deals, as I understand them—between the British National Oil Corporation and a small number of licensees who have equity rights in those two fields. Between them the small ones—the people we are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
talking about—add up to about 11,000 barrels a day. They form a combination of small interests, small licensees, small percentages of barrels of oil. They already have long-established and, I understand, locked-in contractual relationships with BNOC for it to buy all that oil and trade it on their behalf. I shall not go into details about what happens to those contracts because we shall have an opportunity to discuss them when we come to clause 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why cannot they sell it like anybody else on the spot?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the point. What we are trying to do is to match two complementary interests. There is no reason to get dogmatic about this, and the hon. Gentleman is becoming increasingly dogmatic. I am trying to be utterly pragmatic in the way I handle it, as I thought the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate was when he was handling these points.<br><br>
Here we have on the one hand an agency that has been created in charge of the task of managing and trading on behalf of the Government a percentage of royalty oil in kind. That royalty oil in kind is scattered through a number of fields in varying quantities from the 50,000 barrels a day, which the big companies such as BP and Shell have down to very small quotients of existing royalty oil rights in kind, which BNOC has been trading. When I get the chance I will go through a couple more examples to illustrate my point.<br><br>
BNOC quite sensibly said, "We have to collect that royalty oil in the fields. We have to do it within a fixed period of time. It might not add up to a cargo at any time, but if "we collect yours and aggregate the oil together and put it in our cargoes, we can give you a firm, clear deal. We do not force you, a small outfit, to add to your overhead costs by having to have traders of your own or become the victim of the vagaries of the market on a day-to-day or a week-to-week basis."<br><br>
That was a perfect conjunction of genuine, practical and pragmatic interests, with, on the one hand, the oil corporation and, on the other hand, a number of small trading oil companies. It was not a forced arrangment. It was not legislated upon them. It was voluntarily entered into and both sides found it beneficial. BNOC was happy to do it because it got a fee for doing that work which was rather better than it goes for it normal participation-oil, and it served the purposes of the small outfits. It was a perfectly sensible, commercial, pragmatic settlement, and there is no reason to break it up.<br><br>
Now that we are transferring the powers, the Government have announced that they will give the agency a specific trading role in royalty oil: If they do that, and if at the same time the small companies want to carry on the practical and sensible arrangements, why is anybody opposing this provision? We hope that the subsection will allow this agency to do just that. It appears from our Second Reading debate that the Secretary of State, for some curious reason, has decided that he is not inclined to accept it. It is our job to try to persuade him otherwise, and I am trying to do that by demonstrating in a number of existing North sea oil cases that it would make sense.<br><br>
I have quoted Piper and Claymore. If those fee deals went ahead as before, that would give the agency about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
one decent cargo a month to fetch the combination of royalty oil and the small pockets of commercial oil from the small outfits. The same thing has happened in the Forties. By means of Operation Sword, BP sold off small parcels of its existing production to a variety of very small companies, and most of those small companies said to BNOC, "Will you buy our oil?" We have taken it for production reasons. We do not want to bother to trade in that oil. Will you collect this oil for us?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has brought up this rather odd illustration of BP, which splintered its oil. It was conceded to a number of separate companies which were selling to BNOC, or it could sell direct on the spot market. But why can it not, under the usual commercial terms, be aggregated by a number of small companies themselves? When they have aggregated they can sell to a major company, or they can sell it in Rotterdam.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because that is not a simple business. It is quite a complex business for a number of small interests to aggregate and organise themselves. They will all have rights to the oil at different times in the operation. It is far better for an organisation such as BNOCC or the new agency to collect and aggregate this percentage of oil on behalf of the small outfits, especially the same interests, the agency will have to collect about 15,000 barrels of oil from participation. If the agency is to go to them and collect its royalty oil in kind of 15,000 barrels a day, and then on top of that can collect another 10,000 by agreement, putting those two together makes sense commercially, and assists the agency in trading and managing the royalty oil.<br><br>
I could go through a number of examples, but the Forties is the classic case where the combination of the two operations could produce five cargoes a month for the agency, which would give it a really viable, sensible and practical operation in regard to royalty oil in kind, and also provide a service on a fee paying basis which would give it some extra cash, and give a genuine good service to the small companies in some of these fields. There are a number of other examples and illustrations of this sort. I think the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) made the point that there was no reason why the agency, if it is trading in royalty oil, should not also do this on behalf of the small individual companies.<br><br>
I was interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate. Although we have chided each other in the past week or two on other aspects of our respective positions, on these issues there was a great deal of common ground. There is something of a gulf between Government policy and their words and rhetoric in support of the small oil companies. The ninth round was heralded as a great supporting round for the small oil companies. At the same time the nitty-gritty practical problems that the small oil companies are facing are being made worse by the dogmatism of the Government in relation to the role of the agency in handling the oil from those small companies. I think he is also right to pose the question whether onshore oil allowances would not be another blow to the small oil companies. This is one of the areas in which a small company could operate more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
successfully than in the increasingly deep waters of the North sea.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked the Minister why he had stopped fragmenting licences, allowing small companies to buy a piece of the action in the North sea. I will let the Minister make his own case but I have some sympathy with the Government in this regard. There is the taxation aspect, and also the fact that if there is an increasingly complex trading in licences, great difficulties can arise in managing the licensing policy. One curious consequence of the Government's actions is that it is now less likely that small independent oil companies in the North sea will survive. Now that fragmentation is to stop, there will be an increasing number of mergers and takeovers in the North sea. There will be great pressure for bigger and bigger mergers, which will result in the disappearance of the small oil companies and the growth of the larger companies.<br><br>
I was very interested in the Financial Times Energy Finance report in the June edition. I strongly. recommend hon. Members to read the article entitled, "Now even the E&P wolves have a wolf at the door". It describes some of the consequences of Government policy, in that it will lead to a great tendency towards mergers, so that companies will try to gobble each other up and to become bigger to stay in what will be increasingly a big man's game.<br><br>
The article says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Explo is left with little alternative but to dump its equity crude on the spot market with minimum bargaining power."</p></blockquote>
That refutes the hon. Gentleman's point. The article continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"In such circumstances it is not surprising that the E & P shares collectively have been outperformed".</p></blockquote>
The shares of the small companies have not in fact improved anything like those of the large companies, so even the analysts who have no axe to grind spotted that the abolition of BNOC, which played a useful role, will adversely affect the small companies—unless, of course, the Government accept our amendments. I hope that hon. Gentlemen will support our amendments, and so assist the small oil companies trading in the North sea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make absolutely clear to my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) and for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) that, in regard to the power contained in clause 2(1)(d), there is no intention on the part of the Government to give powers to the agency to indulge in extensive trading and speculation in the oil market. That is quite clearly not the intention of the Government in the way they have drafted the Bill, and that will not be permitted.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North said that if that power was there, a future Government without the same common sense and with a different view of the oil industry can do anything might be able to enact it. But, of course, a future Government can do anything; it would have the power to do this whether this power is in the Bill or not. Nonetheless, I should explain the reasons for the provision, although the hon. member for Merthyr Tydfil has, as on previous occasions, done my job for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
me as part of his teach-in process in the Committee, informing us why particular things should be done, but in this case he has helped me to explain why the agency should be able to trade on its own account, although I would again explain to my two hon. Friends that this is only to a limited extent and only with the agreement and under the control of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
One of the reasons why it would be necessary for the agency to trade is its function of being responsible for the disposal of royalty in kind. We discussed this earlier on a previous amendment. The kind of instance that would arise would be if the agency, in accordance with perfectly normal industry practice, sold an expected cargo of royalty oil several weeks in advance of the planned uplifting date, and then found that the cargo failed to become available at that time because of production difficulties. That is the kind of thing that can happen in the oil industry, and in such circumstances the agency would need to purchase the cargo in the market on its own account to fulfil its commitment.<br><br>
Again, for example, if the agency is to be able to maximise its revenues—that point has been made on several occasions by both Government and Opposition members of the Committee—it should carry out its functions in the most efficient and effective manner. I believe that can be helped if the agency trades on its own account to purchase part cargoes from other licensees and it is able to aggregate these with part cargoes of accrued royalty in kind. That is a practical situation, and my arguments for including this provision in the Bill are of a totally practical nature, related to the reality of the oil industry, I believe it is necessary and sensible to have those powers in the Bill. I appeal to both my hon. Friends to consider the practical aspects of the industry. I would make it clear, however, that once the agency is established we intend that its own-account trading should be limited to that necessary to maximise the receipts from royalty in kind.<br><br>
There is also a further reason for proposing this power to trade. It would be essential if participation trading were to recommence. I know my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North is emphatic in his condemnation of retaining the ability to operate participation agreements. That was recommenced because of a treat to security of supply. There again, we would wish the agency to have wide flexibility in order to trade in those circumstances in the national interest. Therefore for both those sets I give practical examples and, again on this wider question of participation, it is sensible that we should have this power in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How will the Minister finance his trading?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to turn to that. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of schedule 3 give the financial powers to enable the agency to trade. So the agency does have power. But they would not have given the agency the responsibility, under the control of the Secretary of State, if they had not had the power to do SO.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Southgate raised important points. He asked why royalty in kind could not be transferred into royalty in cash. There are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
certain advantages in royalty in kind, as he acknowledge. One is an earlier cash flow for the Exchequer. The fiscal regime could be changed to alter that. I have noted what he said but I believe that it is better to keep the fiscal regime stable. It is one thing that the oil industry has been anxious to maintain. Therefore, it is better to approach it in the way in which we have, leave the fiscal arrangements as they are and take the powers under the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is correct that there have been talks in the industry, though not formally, about entering into special arrangements to change the necessity for royalty in kind without the disadvantages to cash flow which I have just mentioned. There are legal and practical difficulties in that kind of arrangement, though of course under the fiscal arrangements anything can be changed by the Finance Bill in any year. However, even if one agreed with my hon. Friend on the policy, this is not the correct time or the correct vehicle.<br><br>
On Amendment No. 51, as I said on Second Reading, the agency will not have a general power in disposing of third party oil. I see no prima facie reason why in normal times the public sector should be involved in trading oil which is produced by private sector companies and sold to privately owned refineries. It is simply a by-product of participation that BNOC has been involved in this way in the past. The arguments put this evening or previously have not convinced me that there is sufficient justification for keeping the public sector involved in this forever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that we shall not persuade the Minister to change his mind on our amendments, and there may be some merit in his commitment to stability. Of course, it is a somewhat belated commitment. There seemed to be changes in the fiscal arrangements for our offshore industry about every six weeks before he became Minister of State. But will he not find some form of words which might placate his hon. Friend the Minister for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) and give some hope to the smaller business sector, which this Government are supposed to be encouraging and which all logic suggests should be sustained?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to that point. Perhaps I should not have given way, because it was a major point in my hon. Friend's speech and in other speeches. May I make it clear to my hon. Friend that there is no discrimination in policy or otherwise against the smaller companies.<br><br>
Farm-ins were mentioned as an example of activities that the Government have perhaps not considered enough. I assure my hon. Friend that they were not introduced in the guidelines because the Dept did not want to be troubled with small oil companies farming into fields. We were concerned about the practice was about to arise. If steps had not been taken, a market would have developed in licences. That was not the intention, because the licences are almost all given under a discretionary system where obligation is laid upon the successful applicant for a particular work programme and so on. If a market develops, the Dept of Energy and the Minsters would be failing in their responsibility to Parliament if they did not preserve the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
obligations undertaken when a licence was introduced.<br><br>
We are not saying that there cannot be farm-ins, but that, as a guideline, we do not want to see more than 10 on a licence. It could be more: there is nothing sacrosanct about the figure. I emphasise that it is a guideline, and if there is a case for the development of a field, I am prepared to listen to it. But I am not prepared to see a market developing in licences, which might have happened had we not stepped in.<br><br>
The recent announcement of results in the ninth round does not show any lack of understanding or appreciation of small companies. That is an instance not of discrimination in favour of smaller companies, but simply of our smaller companies putting forward good applications. They won their awards on their merits, and I am delighted. One does not need to discriminate in favour of smaller independent oil companies, good as that may be in itself, because they now form a lively and important sector of the oil industry which justifies itself.<br><br>
As for the problems for small oil companies that sold their production to BNOC, it is significant that many companies have already expressed an interest in purchasing oil from the small companies. Of course, it is a commercial matter, but it is perfectly possible that there will be a number of such deals. In addition there have been well publicised plans for setting up a co-operative trading organisation. Just because it appears from recent press announcements that insufficient volumes have came forward one should not be despondent about that and say that it cannot happen. I take comfort from the fact that sufficient volumes are not comming forward, because some of the smaller companies under their own resources have found homes for the oil which formerly was taken from them by BNOC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if its possible—I do no more than float it as a speculative thought—that one of the other reasons is that BP has a powerful influence over what happens to the small pockets of oil traded by the small companies in the Forties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If British Petroleum in that case is prepared to help, that is an agreement entered into by BP and its co-licensees. In relation to the Amendment of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), it is worth remembering that some oil companies with availabilities of less than 20,000 barrels a day already operate successful trading departments. Tricentrol is an example. There is no reason to doubt that other companies will also be able to make satisfactory trading arrangements. It is possible that the fact that participation trading will cease may assist some of the smaller producers because they will now have twice the availability to dispose of. Thus, many of them will become not quite such small producers in the trading of oil.<br><br>
12.15a.m<br><br>
Whilst I have concern about some of the smaller oil companies—clearly they are necessary and they have the time to find proper means of disposing of their oil—I certainly do not despair of their ability to do so. All the indications that I have had are that they will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
able to do so, and do so in a satisfactory manner.<br><br>
Therefore I ask my hon. Friend, following my assurances, to consider withdrawing his amendment, as there are reasons for having this power, which we can keep strictly under control and which does not disadvantage some sectors of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I formally move amendment No. 37 and could a vote be taken?</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 2, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The Agency shall exercise the option to or serve election notices to take all liquid petroleum gas to which the British National Oil Corporation was entitled prior to 14th March 1985.'.</p></blockquote>
We move on from royalty oil and participation oil to the third major activity of the British National Oil Corporation and, we hope, of the agency: the trade in liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG. One of the interesting things about LPG is that it defies all the Government's arguments for abolishing BNOC's crude oil activity. Let us not forget that the reasons given by the Government for abolishing BNOC were, first, that it was now making a contribution to destabilising crude oil and crude oil prices by exercising its rights in participation oil, second, that it was not only destabilising the market, but was incapable of influencing the market in any shape or form and, thirdly, that it was a negative factor in its dealings as a result of its large crude oil, participation oil function.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
It was argued that BNOC as a result of its large-scale trading in crude oil had improved the prospect of more oil being traded on the spot-market as opposed to the term basis. None of these arguments applies to LPG. I take one of a number of illustrations of this referred to in the trade press in the wake of the Minister's announcements. [<i>Interruption</i>]. I hope that the sub-committees will decline. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Skeet) has spoken at length—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am always reluctant to take advice on maintaining order from members of the Committee but there was rather more noise than necessary. Normal conversation is perfectly fair but, if hon. Members wish to converse, perhaps they could do so quietly, because I, at least, wish to hear the hon. Member who is speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Knox, and I hope that I can maintain your interest as we develop the case on LPG.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should know that the Chairman is always interested in all the speakers who participate in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was pointing out that there was widespread trade press comment in the wake of the Minister's announcement. It was pointed out that of all the arguments that have been deployed for the abolition of BNOC because of its problems with crude oil activity, not one of those arguments applied to LPG. Let me take one example of such press comment from a petroleum trading magazine:
<br><blockquote><p>"BNOC has successfully encouraged North Sea production (of LPG) and through its term sales and purchase contracts has given a measure of stability to the growing and volatile European market. Many observers believe BNOC's abolition will increase the volume of North Sea LPG sold on a spot basis."</p></blockquote>
Does the Government want to encourage increasing spot marketing trading of LPG? The prevention of the agency exercising participation rights on LPG will apparently do that. There is a further comment on the valuable role that BNOC has played in relation to LPG:
<br><blockquote><p>"BNOC buys its participation LPG at a three-monthly term price. This is negotiated with the 36 or so producers… and is fairly flexible. …Because LPG is expensive to transport and many North Sea producers handle small volumes, some companies prefer to sell their equity LPG direct to BNOC at the participation price. Industry sources argue tha this guaranteed outlet has tended to encourage North Sea LPG output."</p></blockquote>
As the Government are stopping the agency trading in LPG, do they not wish to encourage LPG output from the North sea? Many trade commentators and people who know about LPG trading believe that the firm, stable but flexible arrangements that BNOC has created with many of the producers of LPG in the North sea actually encouraged the development of North sea LPG output. Is it the Government's intention that, as a result of depriving the agency of this right, North sea LPG output is not to be encouraged?<br><br>
Again, it was said:
<br><blockquote><p>"At present, only about 500,000 t/year—less than 20 per cent. of the UK North Sea LPG output—reaches the spot market. The removal of BNOC will inevitably raise this proportion."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
Is that what the Minister wishes to happen? Does he want to encourage the development of an increasing spot market in LPG, as well as the inevitable processes that have gone on in the growth of spot market trading on crude oil?<br><br>
My quotation from the trade magazine ends thus:
<br><blockquote><p>"As one producing company said: `BNOC has been more successful with LPG than it has been with crude. As far as LPG is concerned, it has done a bloody good job."</p></blockquote>
The language is not mine, it is from one of the producers in the North sea.<br><br>
In LPG trading, BNOC has stabilised the market, has produced and maintained term contracts and helped smaller companies to bring their LPG to the market, because the transportation costs involved in handling small volumes of LPG are very considerable. Therefore, it has helped to bring on to the market the small quantities of LPG from the small producers in the North sea and, generally speaking, it has encouraged the development of North sea LPG output.<br><br>
All this seems to be genuinely in the national interest, good commercial sense, a good, reasonable, practical operation and an effective way of trading LPG. Do the Government disagree with that? Do they disagree that BNOC has played this role, in part, in LPG trading, in stabilising the market and encouraging output from the North sea? Do they want that process to continue? If so, what alternative mechanism will be available?<br><br>
I read in the <i>Financial Times</i> that Shell is to set itself up as the trading price mechanism or the market price fixer for LPG in the North sea. I am not sure that that is necessarily a good thing. Many oil producers from the North sea have found in BNOC a very helpful, stabilising and constructive role in the action that it took to develop the LPG market.</span></p>
<p>12.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>1 a.m.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the break I was summarising our case for the amendment. None of the arguments deployed against BNOC's carrying on participation oil trading, or the claim that it has destabilised the market—or the allegation that the corporation has suffered losses because of the amount of oil involved and that its prices have got out of line—applies to its LPG trading. On the contrary, we believe that the operation has contributed to stabilising the market, with term contracts being maintained. It has assisted and encouraged North sea LPG output and helped smaller companies in respect of transporting, distributing and delivery. On top of that, the operation has made a profit.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgage (Mr. Portillo) said that BNOC's involvement in participation rights should end, as it had lost so much money in crude oil deals. But there is certainly no case for abolishing its LPG rights. As the annual report says on page 11:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The remainder of the business (including other term-supplied crude oil and spot-purchased crude oil as well as LPG and products), together with the whole of the business for the first half of the year, generated gross profits of £8.3 million."</p></blockquote>
BNOC trades about 800,000 tonnes of LPG—nearly 600,000 tonnes of propane and just over 200,000 tonnes of butane—a year. It makes a profit of between $3 and $4 a tonne on that trade. The LPG operation is an aspect of BNOC's business that stabilises the market, encourages output, helps smaller companies and also makes a profit. In the name of heaven, what is the case against the agency's being able to carry on such a sensible business, which was bought in the national interest, makes good commercial sense and is of support and assistance to North sea oil companies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I have one or two points to make. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) spoke of BNOC's splendid record in this respect; sales are substantial and profits are made. It should also be borne in mind that while a great deal of LPG is supplied to United Kingdom consumers, much of it is exported, particularly to north-west Europe. Will the Government's proposals imperil those exports? If so, it is further evidence that their actions are not serving the national interest; LPG exports are important.<br><br>
BNOC's annual reports says:
<br><blockquote><p> "Shipping movements continued at about 70 per cent. of the total tonnage sold, operating under three contracts of affreightment."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether those contracts will be placed in jeopardy. Then there is the shipping element. For some strange reason, ship owners continue to give vast sums to the Conservative party. But the industry's plight is so appalling that the Government should not run the risk of further decreasing cargo carrying. Indeed, they should be very careful about introducing any new arrangements in respect of LPG trading.<br><br>
LPG is an increasing important commodity. Profits from its sales should be for the benefit of all, although no doubt Conservative Members are eager to hive them off.<br><br>
Two or three years ago I went to the Brampton Bierlow fire station near Cortonwood colliery, of which hon Members will have heard. I went there to meet the South Yorkshire fire service, and the main topic of our conversation was the deep anxiety felt by the firemen—all experienced and highly trained people—about the movement of LPG. They described to me the potential disaster that would follow the explosion of one load of LPG; the same sort of devastation as that caused by a small atomic bomb would ensue. Movements of LPG are a great potential danger to our communities, and I am concerned that in the free-for-all that the Minister and his hon. Friends want, that sort of risk could be intensified. Experienced fire officers recognise that the risk is a serious one. I suppose that the Department of the Environment is responsible for safety on our highways, and that the Department of Trade and Industry is involved in the safety of storage facilities at places of work—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
concern about possible reductions in manpower in local government and the possibility of a reduction in safety standards consequent upon that? Will he ask the Minister whether he shares my concern, too?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely justified in reminding the Committee of the widespread uncertainty occasioned by the legislation. The lust to reduce manpower in local government and the civil service is plunging the fire services of the metropolitan areas into great uncertainty. At the same time, the Government are proposing dramatically to remove the agency's involvement in LPG matters. In view of the volatility of LPG, the Government should be much more careful and should attempt to understand the nature of the substance. They should take no steps that might increase the peril to the public.<br><br>
I do not like the idea of reducing our capacity to serve the community. The fire service in my area, for example, does not know where it stands at present, although perhaps it shortly will. On top of all that, the public agency that could be involved in trading in LPG and which could set an example for the private sector of how to deal with it is now to be demolished. Will the Minister examine the export opportunity, which seems to be at risk, and the real hazards to the community resulting from the movement of LPG?<br><br>
As Conservative Members want to encourage small businesses, they will want controls to be relaxed, but that will only cause an increase in danger in the case of a substance such as LPG.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhumney made a passing reference to Shell when discussing LPG trading. On 14 May the Under-Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our discussions with the LPG industry lead us to expect that a company or group will soon emerge to fill the role of BNOC in collecting small parcels of LPG from producers who have only small quantities available."[<i>Official Report, 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c.256</i>]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend discovered, first by hearing it on the grapevine, and then by reading it in the Financial Times on 10 June, that Shell—I am perfectly in order, Mr. Knox—is to establish a market price for North sea—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not suggest that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) was out of order, only that he has only just read that article of the <i>Financial Times</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr and Rhymney made a passing reference to Shell which was utterly justified by the report in the <i>Financial Times</i>—one of the few reputable newspapers—although it recently contained a ridiculous report about a colliery in my constituency, but even the <i>Financial Times</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Reports in <i>Financial Times</i> about collieries in the hon. Members consitiuency have nothing to do with the Bill or the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the reference to Shell and LPG seems far more in order with the rules of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
Committee than the recent appallingly lengthy intervention of the Member of Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet), I shall not read out the substantial and serious report. When replying to the House, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State said that discussions had led him and the Minister of State to expect that a company or group would soon emerge. If they knew that Shell was the company, why did they not tell the House on Second Reading? If it has now emerged, why were they not advised that a report about Shell was published a week ago yesterday? Cannot the Minister be more forthcoming?<br><br>
There has been much secrecy. We are told that this or that is commercially confidential. This fact cannot be all that commercially confidential as it appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> over a week ago. Shell is a household name and a multinational company, but I think it is still 60 per cent. Dutch. BNOC was 100 per cent British. Are we so bothered about being internationalists that we can surrender a British institution in favour of one that is dominated a foreign power, albeit a European partner and a friendly nation? Although Shell has much in its favour, it is still not purely British as—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The discussion does not have much to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has, Mr. Knox, in that we are worried about the future of the LPG in Britain. The Government seem to be sacrificing the national interest to allow an international company to play the role formerly fulfilled by a British organisation. They did not see fit adequately to inform the Committee of something that I believe they knew on 14 May. I hope that the Minister will explain that inadequacy and answer the previous questions that were put to him.<br><br>
I trust that the Minister will be able to satisfy me about export trade, especially that with north-west Europe, and the shipping opportunities that might be at risk. I hope that all members of the Committee share my opinion that the substance is so series as a potential hazard that it requires the most responsible and mature approach from the relevant Government Department.<br><br>
In the hope that the Minister will be absolutely forthcoming about the alternative arrangements that are to be made, I shall say no more. I trust that my hon. Friends will ask questions if they wish to do so, and I hope that they will receive satisfactory answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposal that the agency should not deal in LPG should not have an effect on the safety aspects mentioned by the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy). I support what the hon. Gentleman says. Safety is important, but I do believe that changing the arrangements will affect that aspect of the matter. BNOC does not transport LPG; it has to rely on others to do so and they must comply with national and international regulations.<br><br>
I shall try to be forthcoming with the Committee, as requested by the hon. Gentleman. Opposition members of the Committee should bear in mind that we are discussing a very small part of the total market in LPG. BNOC handles less than 30 per cent. of the production from the United Kingdom. If that is lumped together with the total production, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
includes that from refineries, it will be seen that BNOC trades in less than 20 per cent. of the output. I admit that BNOC has traded successfully and profitably, but it trades in a small proportion of the market, which puts the issue into perspective. I question the relevance of BNOC continuing to trade in LPG, despite the profit that has been made.<br><br>
The ability to trade, which is implicit in the amendment, stems from the exercise of the new existing participation options. There would be no logic in any Government policy which provided that it was their intention not to exercise participation options in relation to crude oil while continuing to exercise participation options in another area. I made it clear earlier that BNOC was precluded from exercising new options by the statement of my predecessor the noble Lord Gray on 19 January 1982.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy), the action that the Government propose should not affect exports, nor will it affect British shipping. The shipping policy and practice of BNOC is that it employs whatever shipper gives the best terms, whether it is British or foreign. There is no particular BNOC policy based on nationality. There is a strong export market, which is perfectly capable of continuing.<br><br>
BNOC is already easing out of the arrangements. I did not have inside knowledge of the new arrangements that would come into effect. The report in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 10 June underlines what I said earlier, and repeat now, that others are prepared to take opportunities which are not appropriate for the Government.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wentworth will see that according to the fourth paragraph of that report Shell decided on the action only when it became clear that the Oil and Pipelines Agency—the organisation which will replace BNOC—would not be involved in LPG business. The initiative was taken after the Government made their policy clear.<br><br>
The Shell initiative is entirely appropriate to the smaller producers of LPG. It shows that the private sector is capable of dealing with that function. There may be a problem in relation to smaller producers but the report in the <i>Financial Times</i> states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Shell said that it would integrate the LPG production of any North Sea producer, however small, into its network."</p></blockquote>
That is another indication that the private sector is not only capable of taking over the function, but is prepared to take it over and also to take over the concerns which the hon. Gentleman quite properly raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister of State look at the paragraph which follows the one which he just quoted? It is extremely relevant both to this debate, to our earlier debates and probably to one on Report. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, Shell's marker price will differ crucially from BNOC's, in that it will vary slightly to take account of the extra costs involved in handling the small quantities from independent North Sea producers."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that the margins enjoyed by the small North sea oil producers which may already be hard
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
pressed will be put under even greater pressure as a result of the changes made by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is right that whoever performs the function should do so on a proper commercial basis. However, it should be emphasised that everything is being based simply on reports of what Shell has said; "vary slightly" is the significant phrase. I do not think that too much should be read into that report. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if it is pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I respond, Mr. Knox, I must report to you that the Opposition Benches have been threatened by a plague of greenfly. I do not know where they are coming from, but I hope that it does not get any worse or I might have to seek a short Adjournment to deal with them.<br><br>
The Minister's reply is about the poorest that he has made so far tonight. BNOC apparently cannot win. The complaint that he and other Conservative Members have made was that BNOC was too exposed when it came to crude oil because it had too much oil and too great a percentage of the crude oil to trade. The profile was therefore too high. Their complaint now is that BNOC does not mean much in the LPG market because it is trading in only about 27 per cent. of LPG coming out of the North Sea and even less if the refinery production is also included.<br><br>
There can be either one argument or the other, but not both. Either BNOC was in too exposed a position because it had too much crude oil or it was not exposed and therefore had a sensible operation in relation to its LPG business. The Minister is trying to argue both cases and BNOC cannot win.<br><br>
The Minister did not even begin to address himself to the points that I put to him. I pointed out that LPG has generally remained a term contract business which is unlike the trend that has set in as a result of the crude oil surpluses. It has not destabilised the LPG market. BNOC has been a stabilising influence in the supply and marketing of LPG from the North sea. A case cannot be made against that side of the BNOC's activities. It has not lost money; it has made money. It has encouraged output and has in no way dampened or made matters more difficult for North sea producers. None of those issues were properly addressed by the Minister.<br><br>
I realise that it is now 1.25 a.m. but we are still entitled to a reasonable response to a reasonably argued case. Unless the Minister is willing to improve upon his response I shall urge my hon. Friends to join me in voting for the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in
<br><blockquote><p>(3) In managing petroleum on behalf of the Crown and in trading petroleum under any participation agreement the Agency shall seek to serve to the maximun possible, refining facilities in the United Kingdom.".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 49 touches on a basic problem of refineries. We all read, if not saw, the Minister celebrating, this weekend, the 10th anniversary of the first barrel of oil to arrive on British shores. The <i>Financial Times</i> detailed the problems the Minister faced in keeping the cake in one piece. I hope I am not speaking out of turn, but I understand that the Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
never even got to eat his piece of cake, even though it appeared to dominate the proceedings.<br><br>
The Minister appeared on television. He also issued a press notice, in glowing terms, exuding the complacency about the present and future position of the oil industry that we have come to accociate with him.<br><br>
There are many groups of workers who have nothing to celebrate from the 10-year period. They are the workers in the United Kingdom refineries who have not seen the boom, expansion, improvement and job creation. They have seen only decline, closure and redundancy.</span></p>
<p>1.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that if the Minister has a barrel of oil, we can let him have some feathers to go with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I have occasionally wished other things upon the right hon. Gentleman, I have never thought that that might be the answer to his complacency. I hope to try to persuade him out of the rut by argument rather than by taking the more direct action proposed by my hon. Friend. Although the Minister may have wished to celebrate the marvellous success story of technology and its development, and the increase in jobs—albeit it highly localised—in the period 1975-85, I can trace no success story in Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymey that derived from the 10-year boom in investment in the North sea. In the oil industry generally during that time, there have been as many dramatic victims of recession as successes and beneficiaries from oil development. The victims are the oil refinery workers. They are victims of recession and of a lack of refinery policy that has made great traditional refineries such as Shell Teesport and BP Llandarcy suffer contraction and closure in the past 10 years. Cakes and coffee may have been served in the Argyll field to celebrate the 10th anniversary there, but there have not been even crumbs of comfort for oil refinery workers who have seen their jobs destroyed and redundancy notices issued with sickening regularity.<br><br>
In the same 10-year period that the Minister celebrated last weekend, while oil production grew from nothing to 120 million tonnes, United Kingdom refinery capacity was being cut from 143 million to 90 million tonnes. There is the sharp contrast between two faces of the oil industry. One has seen success, technological boom, and great developments in North sea offshore production, and the other—offshore refining, which we were told is so vital to our national security of supply—contraction upon contraction, and unless something is done to arrest the process, there is further contraction to come.<br><br>
Any organisation or agency over which the Government have influence should pursue an active policy of supporting United Kingdom refineries. It is a chilling thought that Shell, which in 1976 had five refineries in the United Kingdom with a total distillation capacity of 29 million tonnes, will be the end of 1985 be operating only two refineries, and they will have less capacity than the sum total of Shell's North sea oil production. That is where the dramatic imbalance has occurred.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
The Minister has to admit, in answers to questions not long ago, that only 37 per cent. of North sea oil is refined in the United Kingdom. In this regard, BNOC has let the nation down as much as the Government have.<br><br>
As most members of the Committee know, I am not usually a strong critic of BNOC. I have considerable admiration for the way in which it has managed its affairs. But I am not an unthinking or automatic supporter, and as regards BNOC's policy on the distribution of its oil, I feel that it did not give sufficient support to United Kingdom refineries. Of the 870,000 barrels of oil net after sale-back that were traded by BNOC in 1984, only 294,000 went to the United Kingdom market—most of it into refineries. The other 500,000 barrels would have gone to United Kingdom refineries on sale-back, but of the amount traded by BNOC, only 294,000 odd barrels of oil were circulated in the United Kingdom. In contrast, 384,000 barrels went to Europe, more than 107,000 went to the United States, and nearly 10,000 went to other countries.<br><br>
In other words, BNOC has not done very much to support the United Kingdom refinery industry. We are trying to rectify a mistake that was made in not charging BNOC with the task of maximising wherever possible—the amendment is not rigid—refinery capacity in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I hope that with the much smaller amounts of oil at its disposal, the agency will take the national interest and the trading and management of royalty oil and incremental oil of the sort described on previous amendments, extremely seriously. I believe that that touches on our next amendment.<br><br>
We felt that we should highlight the matter, because of the stark contrast between the glowing and complacent description of our North sea oil offshore production and developments of the past decade, which the Minister claims will happen again the next 10 years, and the sad and dreadful story of the destruction of jobs in the United Kingdom refining industry and the fear that in the next decade of United Kingdom oil policy, there will be even more contraction and destruction of jobs.<br><br>
If the agency can do something to arrest the decline, however small, it should be charged with a duty to take those matters fully into account. I move the amendment on that basis and hope for an encouraging and sympathetic response from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern, particularly in the light of certain recent refinery closures. I assure him that the Government take a close interest and keep a close watch on developments in the refining industry, which I think he knows from earlier discussions not in the context of the Bill.<br><br>
However, one must remember that over recent years, the refining industry—the downstream part of the oil industry—has been operating in extremely difficult commercial circumstances. Large profits have not been made in refining. Indeed, it may be the reverse in some cases. One has to respond to the commercial pressures of the industry and of the market in petroleum products.<br><br>
One must also remember that despite the closures
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
which have taken place, the manufacture of oil products in the United Kingdom exceeds demand by about 20 per cent. I reassure the hon. Member for Merthyl Tydfil and Rhymney that the United Kingdom refinery capacity should be sufficient to meet our demands, but one must be mindful of the economic considerations.<br><br>
The amendment appears to require the agency in trading or disposing of petroleum to try to ensure that United Kingdom refiners are given preference over other potential purchasers. If the amendment were accepted, it would put an onus on the agency which would require to disregard some of the commercial and perhaps technical considerations, such as price and delivery arrangements, if the terms which a potential purchaser from abroad offered were preferable to those available on the domestic market. That would have a direct effect on Government revenue, as the proceeds from royalty in kind in those circumstances would not be maximised. If one sought to exert influence in that way, there could be difficulties with EC rules on the free movement of goods. That is an important, though legalistic, consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put to the Minister a question on both scores. He said that the amendment would restrict the agency getting the market price. That raises fundamental questions. Is the Minister suggesting that the royalty oil may not be traded at anything but the market price? He is now making a distinction between a domestic price and the market price. I thought that the market price was the going rate at any particular time. Secondly, if the Minister is suggesting that the amendment cuts across the EC arrangements, what about all the sensible conditions under the ninth licensing round giving preference to United Kingdom industry and technology? Surely, a similar problem would arise. The case will be valid for both or for neither.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not follow the logic of my argument. I see his intention, but if that intention is to be achieved, some preference must be exercised. That means supplying the refineries, in a preferential way, above whatever the market price may be at any time. I cannot see a way other than price in the commercial decisions of the refinery. Otherwise, the amendment will be nothing but words, and will achieve nothing.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was concerned about the criteria that are laid down for the EC arrangement. If the hon. Gentleman studies them closely, he will see that we seek to do two things: first, to provide full and fair opportunities for British firms, which is a reasonable thing to do; and secondly, to ensure that new technology is based in the UK. That does not discriminate against others. We merely want those who develop technology to do so in the UK. That is not an unusual provision in many countries that are developing their natural resources. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My concern is to support the measures. Is the Minister saying that the EC has not queried the terms of the ninth round licences?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0209">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The EC is always interested in what happens, and such matters are discussed with the EC from time to time. However, questions of open trading could run into certain difficulties.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked for the actual figures of the oil that is exported and the oil that is used in our own refineries. The full figures that I have available are those for 1983, when about 61 per cent. of UKCS crude oil production, or 67 million tonnes, was exported, and our refining industry imported 34 per cent. of its crude requirements - that is 23 million tonnes. Those figures are not surprising; they reflect a simple reason. Honourable Members know that North sea oil is high quality and therefore fetches a premium on the world market. The needs of the UK refining industry - our capacity exceeds our demand - can be met more cheaply by importing lower-quality crudes to meet part of our refining requirements. We export much of our own crude production and import other crude production for technical and commercial reasons, and that makes sense. If we did not do that, we would not realise the best value or the best price for our oil.<br><br>
1.45 a.m<br><br>
Therefore, while the amendment expresses many good intentions, which I support, to encourage our refining industry, if it is to mean anything it will run into the difficulties that I sought to describe.<br><br>
However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I share his concern about the refining industry and redundancies, but equally he must agree with me that if our industry is to survive internationally it must be efficient because oil products are traded internationally. Hard though conditions have been in some areas, there is now no doubt that we have one of the more efficient refining industries in Europe and I hope that in future it will be able to compete effectively in the international oil products market. I repeat that while I have sympathy with the intentions behind the amendment it would not make sense to incorporate it in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If one can, in one Division, vote against EC interference in our United Kingdom operations and for good intentions and jobs in the refining industry, that combination is irresistable. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friends to support the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 2, line 27, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>`(4) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State and the agency to ensure all transactions and functions of the Agency shall be in the national interest.'.</p></blockquote>
I am pleased that at such an early hour in the morning the Room is so full when I move the amendment. I apoligise if there are those present who may have wanted to be doing something other than sitting here listening to the debates on the amendments that have been dealt with in the past few hours.<br><br>
I am in some dilemma in that I believe that the Minister may accept the amendment which speaks of making it the duty of the Secretary of State and the agency to ensure that
<br><blockquote><p>"all transactions and functions of the Agency shall be in the national interest."</p></blockquote>
Given the spirited way in which the Minister fought off the ideological amendment tabled by his hon. Friends the Members for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) and for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo), he may be inclined to accept that the national interest should be written into clause 2 as a major safeguard.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will recall that on 6 March, a few days before he made the announcement in the House about the abolition of BNOC and the introduction of the proposed agency, he made a sterling defence of BNOC. He gave evidence to the Select Committee on Energy that day and told the committee that the corporation had many interests to cover for the country.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister could not, seven short days after giving evidence, have changed his mind to such an extent as to be unable to embody the national interest in clause 2, which if carried, will form a major part of the Bill.<br><br>
May I remind the Minister of his evidence to the Select Committee? In answer to a question I asked him on the spring Supplementary Estimates, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think one has to look back at the basic purposes of BNOC and whilst it is true that one of the objectives of BNOC is of course to trade profitably, there are also a number of other functions which make it different from a company in the private sector."</p></blockquote>
I agree with the Minister there. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has, and this has been spelt out at different times, responsibility for example towards security of supplies; it has responsibility for maximising the benefit to the United Kingdom economy, and given those different roles that it has—another one is that it does provide evidence of arm's length prices so far as taxation is concerned, and this was made clear in the Treasury evidence to the Committee—I do not think it is possible to make a direct comparision between the role of BNOC and the role of the private sector company. Where the role of BNOC is particularly different is when it takes account of the wider public interest, and that is why, before proposals are made on BNOC prices, there is this recognised procedure of consultation between BNOC and the Government because it is the Government that provides this wider national interest before final decisions are taken."</p></blockquote>
That was an honest and forthright statement by the Minister, and one that I concur with. I cannot see how the Minister could have so changed his opinion of the role of the agency. Obviously, to secure profitable trading the Minister was forced to bring in the legislation hurriedly and was trying to plug a gap that many of his hon. Friends on the Floor of the House said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0210">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
had been produced by the two Supplementary Estimates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a presumption that in all legislation the Secretary of State acts in the national interest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. Although the subject is not covered by the amendment, we could discuss whether in selling off a large stake in Britoil the Secretary of State was working in the national interest. It is possible, as a Conservative member of the Select Committee said the same morning, that if we were able to produce as well as to trade in North sea oil, we would be in a better position to sustain prices and so save having to put forward Supplementary Estimates as we had on two occasions. It appeared, on the face of it, that the Government had to put in £86 million to keep up the price of North sea oil in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend's argument, but I should like to respond to the intervention of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). The national interest is always the Secretary's of State's interest. That presumption was overthrown in the recent court case where Mr. Ponting was found to be acting in the national interest—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. Ponting has nothing whatsoever to do with the Oil and Pipelines Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go down that route, Mr. Knox, although I understand that the judiciary in that case said that the national interest is something different from the definition given by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) in his intervention.<br><br>
The Supplementary Estimates appeared to stampede the Government Benches into feeling that something should be done about BNOC. No one can say with any certainty that the £86 million or a little less that went into BNOC in the two Supplementary Estimates represented a net loss. It is certain that at least 75 per cent. of that would have come back into the Treasury through taxation anyway. If in the short term it did what it was meant to do and kept the price of North sea oil up, it is likely that the other 25 per cent. plus could have gone back to the Treasury.<br><br>
I see that the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) shakes his head. I do not see how we can turn round and say that the £86 million did not work in the national interest if it kept up the price of North sea oil, and the take-off to the Treasury was higher than it would have been if North sea oil prices had fallen. Although BNOC seems to have made a loss in 1984-85 because of the Supplementary Estimates, we still have to put any loss that it was making on its trading against the revenues of £12 billion coming into the Treasury in 1984-85. Somebody may have been brave enough to say that it was not wrong to gamble. The word "gamble" was not used by the Minister or anyone on the Select Committee on Energy. The idea of putting £86 million into BNOC to keep up the price of North sea oil made sure that £12 billion came into the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
Treasury as opposed to £11.5 billion, and it was money well spent in the national interest.<br><br>
If in the short term the expenditure did what it was meant to do, it is likely that the national interest was served at that time by using public funds in that way. Although I was reluctant to see it used for what seemed to be a subsidy for private oil companies in the North sea, it may have been in the national interest.<br><br>
Conservation is a wider issue than BNOC which would be promoted by the amendment. The North sea oil reserves are depleted, but I do not believe that they will run out in the next decade. However, we can say that in the next decade known reserves are likely to be much smaller than at present, and that it is likely to be substantially more expensive to get them out as they will be in smaller pockets.<br><br>
I believe that in an energy-rich country such as Britain conservation ought to be considered, as it is in the national interest. If the amendment is endorsed by the Minister, he could ensure that, if the Bill is passed, the agency takes the national interest to include conservation. Whatever operations the agency takes part in, it should make sure that energy conservation will be part and parcel of it.<br><br>
In the Select Committee on 6 March I said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If production peaks, exports will decline?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
<br><blockquote><p> "That is a perfectly fair assumption, if production peaks sufficiently to contract our conservation efforts, it would have the effect on what is exported."</p></blockquote>
That is a very crude way in which the national interest is served in relation to conservation. It seems to me to be open to the ravages of the market. I should like to see a much greater emphasis put on conservation both offshore and onshore in relation to oil. If it were, everyone who worked for the agency would know that we as a nation intended to have oil well into the next century, although perhaps a much smaller supply than at present.<br><br>
I should like to believe that the Minister will accept the wider national interest, about which the Government spoke only a few months ago, by agreeing to the amendment. I realise that 1984-85 has been a good year for North sea oil production, drilling and new developments. It has been a good year despite the attacks made by the Government on Britoil and others. However, we still need to make sure that the national interest is looked after assiduously by the agency if it takes a leading role in the North sea. My admendment does not contradict any other clause or schedule and I hope that the Minister will accept it. Perhaps his hon. Friends may vote for it in a Division if the Minister does not accept it.</span></p>
<p>2 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's hope that Conservative Members will support the amendment. I am sure they will when they see the definition of national interest, even though their definition of national interest is different from ours. We define it as decisions taken to assist those who live in our country. Conservative Members can vote for that, even though their definition is to assist those who own the country. We can all agree to the amendment, even though Conservatives have a different perception of it.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0211">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
The Minister said that BNOC had not even considered whether it should use British ships to transport its products. It has merely used any ship that happened to be sailing by.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or greenfly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or greenfly. It was probably British. Its interest was not served by the present Administration and it probably died while listening to the speech of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet).<br><br>
The Conservative party has accepted large sums from shipping interests, but it has not been interested to ensure that British shipping carried British goods. That detachment from the national interest cannot continue. Perhaps it can continue in constituencies covering Bedford, Southgate or Rochford. But it is getting worse, even in Rochford. However, our areas have reached rock bottom. We cannot allow the national interest to be neglected any longer.<br><br>
In Prime Minister's Question Time this afternoon, one Conservative Member referred to the crime rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The crime rate has nothing to do with the functions of the agency. The hon. Gentleman must confine his remarks to the amendment, so ably moved by his hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am relating my remarks to the amendment by suggesting that certain things have to be done in the national interest. We cannot afford to throw earnings away which could be devoted to good purposes such as pursuing a reduction in the crime rate, to which Conservative Members give high priority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that he is stretching this point too far. Perhaps he will have the goodness at this hour of the night to confine his remarks to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do so. I will not trespass on that point again. We may find that it becomes relevant again by the time we reach Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suspect that the Speaker will take a much rougher attitude than I.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only voicing a suspicion, Mr. Knox, not a certainty.<br><br>
On Second Reading, much was made of the bouyant, ebullient and patriotic speech which the Minister of State made in Texas. That speech was the most enjoyable and most forward-looking speeches that we have ever heard from a Minister in the present Government. I believe in giving credit when credit is due because one can be even more angry, and emphatic in our condemnation, if the prospects that were dangled before us in the speech are not fulfilled; and, unless the Government change their attitude, they will not be.<br><br>
The Minister said that he wished to see more commercial and industrial orders for Britain as a result of North sea involvement. He was right to make that speech in America because the United States Administration would not have been as lackadaisical as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
the British Government in serving the national interests.<br><br>
Let me illustrate. We are right to tell our allies and friends and our European partners in the council of Europe and the European Community that at times of crisis, and perhaps of shi'ite blackmail, we will sustain them in their oil-less condition in resisting such difficulties.<br><br>
There are times when we can afford to be completely unselfish. But to be so day in, day out, hour by hour, while watching other nations operate their arrangements, govern their industry and ensure that their commercial practices bring their people benefit, is not possible. We have to remember that we are not a rich and powerful country and we must begin to look after our own interests rather more than in the past.<br><br>
Unemployment in many constituencies—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot see what connection unemployment in Britain has with the transactions and functions of the agency. The hon. Gentleman must not wander into a general discussion on unemployment, however appropriate it may be on another occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting, Mr. Knox that the Government run the agency and other interests rather more vigorously in the national interest, because of the parlous condition of the country. I am sorry that you feel that that call is irrelevant. Unfortunately, the Government also appear to have perceived such a call as irrelevant judging by the decisions they have made during the past four years.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was right to move an amendment that suggests that the Government adopt a different pose. At present, we behave like a man who offers his neighbour the left cheek and, having had it struck, then offers the right one. That is a silly position to adopt, and the Government should recognise its absurdity.<br><br>
A newspaper article the other day tried to find a precedent for the present Administration and its service to the national interest in this way. It asked, "Where can we go back? To which Conservative Adminstration do we have to turn to find a parallel?" The conclusion, made by someone who clearly was not very knowledgeable about history, was that the parallel was with Palmerston. I say only that if someone like Palmerston were in No. 10 Downing street today, my hon. Friend would not have had to table the amendment, because the national interest would be served rather better by an intelligent reactionary of the 19th century than by the unintelligent reactionaries who appear likely to oppose my hon. Friend's amendment, which is both patriotic and entirely relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to return to the Bill. It gives the new Oil and Pipelines Agency certain agency functions which it will perform on behalf of the Secretary of State. Its functions are subject to control by the Secretary of State in many important respects.<br><br>
The agency's functions and activities will be carried out under agreements entered into with the Secretary of State, who will determine which new participation agreements are entered into by the agency and which existing agreements are put into effect.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0212">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
Again, full participation trading and trading in petroleum by the agency in its own account will be subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. Ultimately, he will have a power of direction—as I mentioned earlier to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands)—conferred under clause 5(1)(a).<br><br>
I emphasise that we are discussing an agency acting on the Secretary of State's behalf and under his control. The issue is the Secretary of State's performance in relation to the national interest. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) was right to say that the Secretary of State is presumed to act in the national interest. I appreciate that the actions of some Secretaries of State—although this certainly does not apply to my right hon. Friend—could give rise to problems, but they will be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament; that is the proper place to debate where the national interest lies and to exercise control in this respect.<br><br>
I do not disagree with what the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) said about BNOC's past performance and its much wider functions—not just agency functions—and the fact that it has acted in the national interest. I stand by what I said to the Select Committee in that respect. That judgment was the view of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and myself and others at the Department.<br><br>
I feel that the amendment is unnecessary; responsibility rests with the Secretary of State. Indeed, I believe that it may have an effect that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney would not welcome. The amendment would transfer the determination of what is in the national interest and scrutiny of the agency's actions in that respect from Parliament and the Executive to the courts. In other words, if a dispute arose about whether the agency had acted in the national interest, that would have to be settled in the courts. Although I certainly do not doubt the quality of the judiciary and its independence of Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. If the courts could have such jurisdiction, was I not in order in drawing an allusion with the Ponting case decision, which determined the national interest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The distinction that I am making is between the Government's working in the national interest and the requirement that the agency should do so, too. Of course, that could also be decided by the courts. But I believe that the proper controlling body in this respect is Parliament, with its powers of supervising and scrutinising the Secretary of State's actions. Although I sympathise with the objectives of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, I do not believe that the amendment is necessary; it could also have unwelcome effects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but I am trying to unravel what he is trying to say. He told us that if the amendment were passed, the agency would be subject to the courts' jurisdiction. Are we to infer that the Secretary of State is not?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the exercise of such judgment is a matter for Parliament. If the Secretary of State contravenes a statute, of course he is subject to the courts —just like anyone else.<br><br>
I do not wish to be unhelpful to the hon. Gentleman, because I sympathise with his aims. But, in view of the possible effects of his proposal, I hope that he will consider withdrawing the amendment.</span></p>
<p>2.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to disappoint the Minister, but I cannot withdraw the amendment. The Minister appears to be saying that it would be wrong to take the Secretary of State to court and make him responsible for the national interest. He appears to be saying that Parliament should decide whether the Secretary of State's action is in the national interest. Under the amendment, the Secretary of State would in effect have to convince a jury that he had taken appropriate action. But if the amendment is rejected, we will have to forget about a jury of 12 just men and women and be content to rely on the payroll vote in the House of Commons. We know that, irrespective of the national interest, the payroll vote would be likely to protect the interests of whichever Government were in power and therefore the interests of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
If that is the option offered by the Minister, I must press the amendment to a vote because I see no contradiction with the Bill.</span></p>
