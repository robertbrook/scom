</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first three amendments are probing amendments to deal with the liabilities that have accrued to BNOC and will be transferred to the new agency. Amendment No. 60 is clumsily worded, but it also touches on which of the present BNOC liabilities may be transferred to the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will be in order and apposite to pursue a matter of which I gave the Minister notice at the beginning of our second sitting. I said that the Committee had not had the benefit of having BNOC's annual report for its first sitting. On a point of order I asked whether the Minister would answer queries urgently on the fact that BNOC's report states that £12 million of the losses incurred to March 1985 had not been covered by Government subvention or grants. The Minister courteously explained that he would deal with that matter at the appropriate time. Opposition Members consider that as the clause seeks to transfer the liabilities of the corporation to the agency, this may be the appropriate time to deal with the matter, and I gather that the Minister does not dissent from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before turning to the substantive issue of the losses that BNOC incurred in 1984-85 that led to the problems of the liabilities to be transferred to the new agency, I want to deal with the first part of amendment No. 60, because that concerns a rather different issue. In that amendment, we suggest that the burden of rates on empty BNOC properties should not be transferred to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debate on clause 1(4) we discussed the rate burden on BNOC and possibly on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
agency. The Minister said that the cost was £750,000 and we feel that that is a sufficiently large amount for us to suggest that such a burden should not be visited, at least in part, on the agency, which should not have empty office properties dumped on it. Since then it has been rumoured that the original offices of BNOC at Bolton Street have been let or are in the process of being let. Can the Minister say whether that is correct, so that we may know whether the loss to BNOC, or at least the burden of rates on empty properties, will be less than hitherto expected? Presumably, it would be less than the £750,000 that the Minister talked about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what marvellous private corporation is likely to take over these blocks. If they are taken over by another Government Department, the costs of the rate burden will simply be transferred. Rumour has it—I find it incredible —that the Ministry of Defence will move into BNOC's empty office block. I hope that that is no part of the takeover bid, and that the Ministry of Defence is not moving in on the pipelines and storage side of BNOC, which would be the responsibility of the new agency. I hope that the Minister will assure us that we are not shuffling-off a set of costs from BNOC. Presumably even more of BNOC's existing office space will become available because of the smaller staff envisaged by the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the extra burden of costs will not be passed on to yet another Government. Department such as the Ministry of Defence. Those of us who spend some of our time in Norman Shaw, North building know that the Ministry of Defence is quite enough. It is all around us. A very strong case would have to be made to the Public Accounts Committee to justify the Ministry of Defence taking over redundant BNOC property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this is rumour, and I have learnt never to live on rumour. So I hope that the Minister will tell us the facts. Can he also tell us what reduced rate burden will be passed to the agency? There is no reason why the agency should start its life with a huge rates burden on parts of empty properties which were not its responsibility, and which were unconnected with its activities or functions. I should also like to know how much less office space the new agency will require, and how much less the rates will be. We should oppose any notion of transferring the costs of the larger organisation to the smaller agency. That is the first part of amendment No. 60, and I await the Minister's comments on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much more important part of our amendments relates to the costs, losses and debts that were incurred by BNOC in 1984—the result not of BNOC's decisions or judgments, but of the judgments or misjudgments of Ministers. The burden of our case, and the essence of amendment No. 60, is that the financial problems and losses incurred in 1984 by the BNOC should not be reflected, transferred to or visited upon the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sins of the Government and Ministers which led to the consequential financial losses for the BNOC in 1984-85 should not be visited on the agency. The purpose of amendment No. 60 and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>299</span>
thrust of our argument about the transfer of liabilities from the corporation to the new agency is that neither the corporation nor the agency can be expected to pick up the tab for any losses resulting from ministerial judgments and decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me outline our reasons for making that case. The downfall of BNOC began last year and is well described in BNOC's 1984 annual report. BNOC attempted to prop up the price in the summer and autumn of last year and again at the beginning of this year. The losses created by that action were a result not of BNOC's judgments but of ministerial misjudgments. That is why we believe that our amendment is justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accounts on page 10 of the annual report reflect not BNOC's performance, but the ministerial performance. Therefore, the liabilities and assets that can be identified as the Minister's responsibilities, should not be transferred from BNOC to the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we would all agree that Lord Cobham has always been a man of great integrity, both in public service and as chairman of BNOC. On page 3 of the annual report, he states:
	<br><q><p>"the profits which had been earned by the hard work of the staff"</p></q>
were lost as a result of the decision to pursue a different line of financing. He goes on to describe how the losses were incurred as a result of the corporation taking into account the United Kingdom national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same point is made forcefully by the chief executive, Mr. Goskirk, in his statement. He explains how, as a result of the Government's decisions in consultation with BNOC, the corporation did not move the price—although its commercial judgment would have been otherwise—and therefore the losses were incurred. Let me draw the Committee's attention to Mr. Goskirk's comment on page 8 of the annual report:
	<br><q><p>"The Corporation considered that its own commercial interests could best be protected by a reduction in term prices; however the Corporation is also obliged to take into account the wider national interest of which it cannot be the arbiter, and accordingly after consultation with Her Majesty's Government and in full recognition of the losses which would inevitably result, it was decided to continue the then-existing contract prices. Many of the Corporation's customers thereatfer chose to terminate or reduce their contract purchases and by the end of the third quarter roughly half of the Corporation's freely tradeable crude oil was being sold on the spot market. Substantial losses resulted."</p></q>
That paragraph clearly states that it was not BNOC's commercial judgment but the Government's judgment, or misjudgment, that created the losses. They had a tremendous effect on the balance sheet and profit and loss account of BNOC, but we feel that none of the Government's sins should be visited on the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not yet have Hansard for the last part of Tuesday's sitting. But during our debate on the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley;(Mr. Barron) Which dealt with the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>300</span>
issue of national interest, the Minister accepted full responsibility. He accepted that the Secretary of State had the duty to decide what the national interest was. Apparently, last year and at the beginning of this year, BNOC was asked to lose money in the national interest and thus incurred the losses described in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness to the Minister, I should say that he ha .s never denied his responsibility. On page 57 of the evidence to the Select Committee on Energy he accepted that it was for the Secretary of State and the Ministers to define the national interest and not for BNOC. Furthermore, the Treasury also accepts a measure of responsibility for the problems that have arisen and for the balance sheets that appear on page 10 of the BNOC report. I quoted it once before, but it is worth reminding the Committee what was said. On page 37 of the evidence to the Select Committee on Energy, Mr. Cassell, a major official in the Treasury said:
	<br><q><p>"OPEC have reached some sort of agreement on price, nobody can tell whether it will stick, or I do not think anybody can tell whether it will stick in the long-run, but at least we are in a position where it would be rather rash of us to do anything that undermined that agreement which OPEC have made until the markets have had a chance to judge the OPEC agreement and all its implications."</p></q>
A top Treasury official was saying that the Treasury accepted that it was a policy decision for BNOC to lose money because we did not want to undermine OPEC—that was when we almost became an associate member of OPEC. A Treasury official has stated that it was broader issues of policy on oil pricing and so on and the desire to prop up OPEC's price position which caused BNOC to incur the losses which it made at the end of 1984 and at the beginning of 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an overwhelming case to be made that none of the costs and responsibilities for the decisions which led to the losses in the last part of 1984 and the first quarter of 1985 should be put at BNOC's door. Certainly, no consequential liabilities should be passed to the new agency. The Minister made those assessments; he lost BNOC money as a result and he must pick up all the tabs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine those losses and see what impact they had on BNOC's balance sheet. Some of those losses might get passed over, under the clause, to the new agency. On page 10 of the annual report the figures are laid out in considerable detail. The losses in 1984 as a result of an interventon in the market, net of profits made from other aspects, came to £28.7 million. Those losses occurred between 1 August and 16 October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not entirely explain the full loss as a result of the direct intervention. First, as I understand it, that includes some profits that have been made. The amount lost as a result of the direct decisions of Government not to allow BNOC to shift its price was about £36 million. Secondly, as the annual report explains, provision has also been included in the accountsthe profit and loss accounts and the balance sheets at the end of the year—to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>301</span>
take account of the losses incurred in crude oil trading in the first quarter of 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again as a direct result of Government intervention, there was a loss of $120 on every barrel that BNOC traded. That is not because BNOC wanted it. Mr. Goskirk explains that BNOC's commercial judgment was to move the price and therefore not incur the losses. Had it done so, it would not have incurred the loss of $1.20 a barrel. That loss is entirely attributable to the Government and to the Ministers. They must pick up the tab, the gross cost of which is listed on page 10 as being £49.8 million in 'the first quarter. Although the Government presented Supplementary Estimates to the House—they were the subject of the Select Committee's report—they have not accepted that they should pick up the whole tab.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total loss on contracts for 1984 was £35.9 million and the grant did not cover it completely as it was £28.4 million, some £7 million short, and was sufficient only to restore the reserves to the historic £30 million figure. Even in 1984, the Government did not accept direct responsibility for the total cost of their decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, despite the £40.9 million lost in the first quarter of 1985—again at the behest of the Government—BNOC received only £38.1 million grant, about £2 million short. Why did the Government not accept the total loss, the result of their misjudgment and interference in oil pricing policy in the summer and autumn of 1984 and in the first quarter of 1985? The gross cost of Government interference over that period was £85.2 million; the Minister must accept that as his responsibility. Only £66.5 million of that total was covered by grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that one of the reasons why we were not told the whole truth and why the whole grant was not paid was that Ministers were too embarrassed to explain how much their judgment had cost BNOC. I shall come shortly to the net cost, after allowances for taxation, but BNOC's accounts show the £85.2 million of total losses—a result of the Government's two basic misjudgments on intervention in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government argue that they lost nothing like that sum, and that it was BNOC which made the loss. In evidence to the Select Committee on Energy in February of this year, the Department of Energy in its memorandum of evidence explained fully why there had not been much of a loss. The Department argued, in paragraph 10, on page xxii, that the Government had not lost any money. The paragraph reads:
	<br><q><p>"In the particular circumstances in which BNOC's losses were made last year, they were more than offset by a higher level of tax revenue than would otherwise have been the case."—</p></q>
because the price of oil was kept up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the Department's case to the Select Committee, and on the Floor of the House in December 1984. The Minister argued that the Government had made money by losing money; in 1984 BNOC lost £35.9 million by trying to maintain an artifi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
cially high price, but from the taxation on the higher price, the Government more than offset that sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gross loss on BNOC's 1984 trade in crude oil at a price that the market did not accept was £35·9 million, and the Government say that was more than offset by the higher tax revenue. By how much more?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £40.9 million loss in the first quarter of this year is reflected in BNOC's balance sheet and profit and loss account. How much of that £40.9 million was offset by tax revenue from the oil price? This is the Minister's opportunity to give the clear, direct answer that he did not give the Select Committee. Two members of this Committee also served on the Select Committee. The figures were not given to the Select Committee and it is important that we chase them up. What was the net cost of the operation in the first quarter of this year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that BNOC lost £40.9 million at $1.20 a barrel in the first quarter, not through its own judgment, but through the Government's judgment. How much should we deduct from that figure for higher tax revenue achieved through maintaining the higher price?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that there was a formula. Paragraph 10 on page xxii of the Select Committee report says:
	<br><q><p>"where BNOC is able to sell more than approximately 25 per cent. of oil at term prices, therefore, its losses"</p></q>
are sustainable if we balance the gain and loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January and February, Ministers refused to tell the Select Committee how much of BNOC's oil was traded in term contracts in the first quarter of 1985. That figure would help us to identify the net loss or gain caused by higher taxation. There can be no commercial considerations now, on the eve of BNOC's abolition; the Minister should tell us plainly what happened to BNOC's trading in the first quarter. Did BNOC trade any oil in term contracts in the first quarter and, if so, did it achieve 25 per cent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Select Committee I heard the hon. Member for Rochford ask Mr. Goskirk what percentage was sold spot in the first quarter and what percentage was sold on term contracts. It is important to know the net cost to the state of the first quarter's price interventions. We know that BNOC incurred a loss of £40.9 million and the Government argue that the loss was offset by higher taxation. The Department of Energy's memorandum to the Select Committee said that if BNOC traded 25 per cent. at term prices, its losses would be sustainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much oil did BNOC sell at spot prices in the first quarter of this year and how much at term price? What was the net loss to the state of the first quarter's operation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Government and the Treasury to be comforted by the fact that they have offset some of BNOC's losses by higher tax revenue, but not enough of the higher tax revenue went to BNOC to offset the total cost of the operation. More than £66 million went in grant, but the losses were more than £85 million. BNOC's accounts reflect the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>303</span>
gap between its gross cost and the Government's net grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To add to the mystery of it all and to our case that none of the problems should be passed on to the agency, there is the incredible fact that the Government did not cover March's losses at all. The Select Committee fully appreciated that argument. It took evidence in February but I do not think that it knew then that there would be an overall loss of another £8.4 million in March. Perhaps that was not estimated. The Select Committee should have known that the Government would not cover such a sum, because they told the Committee. However, I do not think that its normally vigilant members noticed the rather curious small print in one of the minutes of the Department of Energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loss in March of a further £8.4 million was not covered by any form of grant, which is why BNOC's overall loss for the year to the end of March 1985 was £12 million. Why did not the Government accept at least part of the loss? A statement on that can be found in a minute on page 67 at the back of the Select Committee's evidence. I do not know whether any members of the Select Committee noticed it. Perhaps they can let me know. The minute was signed on behalf of the Secretary of State by an anonymous assistant secretary on 13 February 1985 and it states:
	<br><q><p>"With the agreement of the Treasury, he has written to the Chairman to assure him that the Government's policy towards the Corporation remains as stated in the Minute laid by the Department on 23 October and that he intends to seek approval from Parliament to enable him to make grant to the Corporation to enable it to continue to meet its obligations accruing during the first quarter of 1985 and to restore its financial reserves to an appropriate level during that quarter. In calculating the appropriate level of reserves, no account would be taken of any liabilities which accrue in respect of the period after the end of February."</p></q>
The Government partially accepted financial responsibility for the problems occurring in the first quarter and were prepared to give a grant sufficient to raise the corporation's reserves to an appropriate level. They then said that no account would be taken—not " might " be—
	<br><q><p>" of any liabilities which accrue in respect of the period after the end of February."</p></q>
That means that March is not covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Rochford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman let us have the date of that minute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was 13 February. So it was halfway through February.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that for the Government to say in February that it would not make further grant provision beyond the date of the minute, was prudent and wise?.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be a sign of prudence if the Government created the loss for the corporation. It is a shrugging off of responsibility and an abrogation of liability. As a result of decisions taken by Ministers, the British National Oil Corporation incurred a loss in March—it was not on BNOC's commercial judgment—so why should that responsibility be shrugged off?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can suggest the reason to the hon. Member for Rochford. It has been puzzling me. As the minute said that no account " would " be taken—not " has been " taken or " might be " taken—of any liabilities, I suggest that the Government had decided to abolish BNOC in mid-February. The Government were saying, " We shall not take any account of the liabilities after February because we are in the process of planning to wind the show up." That would explain the wording. I hope that the hon. Member for Rochford will join me in pressing the Minister for an explanation, because I do not believe that the Select Committee pursued it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a smell about the decision to take no account of any liabilities after the end of February. If it was planned to wind up BNOC, the Minister's evidence to the Select Committee on 6 March is much more worrying and misleading, than we thought. Why, in the middle of February, did the Department of Energy decide not to accept any responsibility for the losses in March, if it had accepted its responsibilities up to that time, unless it had decided to wind up the show? That is what I deduce from these curious words in this very curious minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Rochford will agree with me that that is a possibility and as good an explanation as the one that he gave. Certainly, the explanation has nothing to do with prudence. The Government had been imprudently losing money on behalf of BNOC, and suddenly they drew a line at the end of February on such losses, although they knew that there would be a loss in March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that the hon. Gentleman is right in his deductions, it is still a sign of prudence for the Government not to commit themselves beyond that date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a sign of preparing for the abolition of the corporation. There is not much point in giving the corporation a grant to cover the liability when the decision has been taken to wind up the show. That is not prudence. It is an inevitable consequence of the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the point further, is not the intelligent burglar prudent in establishing an alibi before he goes out with his jemmy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one way to put it. Rather than surmise, let us put the question to the Minister. Why did the Department of Energy decide to abrogate at the end of February its responsibility for liabilities to be incurred in March?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We firmly believe that none of the liabilities should be transferred from the corporation to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
agency. The Minister will have to explain the gaps in the way the Government supported the corporation as a consequence of their own decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can trace the impact of all this in the profit and loss account and balance sheet of the corporation in 1984. The net loss in that year was £12 million. It would have been more, but for the success of the LPG side of the operations, which offset some of the costs. There was no cover for the March loss of £8·4 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first three amendments are probing amendments to discover what liabilities are to be transferred. In the 1984 balance sheet, current liabilities are shown at £526·6 million The assets are still in excess of that amount, at £543·8 million. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what those assets are and what will be transferred to the Agency? Will all or part of the current assets up to December 1984 be transferred across, and in what way? A total of £543·8 million is a substantial bunch of assets. Will the Minister tell us what they are and break them down for us? Although we shall discuss the financing of the new agency on a later amendment, perhaps he will tell us what the current assets are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of Government interference is clearly shown by comparing the balance sheet for 1983 with that for 1984. In 1983 the corporation was worth £30·3 million. That is roughly what it has been worth since its formation in 1982. I think that it was funded on a £27 million or £30 million capital base, or reserve base, which has shrunk to £18.3 million as a result of the Minister's efforts in the last half of 1984 and the beginning of 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain what will be transferred across, and in what form? Will he explain in detail what happened as a result of the Government's decision not to cover BNOC's full costs and losses as a result of their decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). In certain respects he made rather a meal out of them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) showed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me fair questions about property and rates. He referred to the former premises at Bolton Street. I understand that the corporation hopes to assign the lease shortly, but that negotiations have not been completed. As it is the corporation's responsibility until those negotiations are completed, I cannot give any details at present. However, there are good hopes that it will be assigned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that the building has not just been transferred to another Government Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present I cannot say. We have to allow the negotiations to be completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked me about rates, and asked about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
the figure of around £750,000 which I gave the Committee as the rates for the present year on the two properties owned by BNOC. A total of £321,000 was paid in rates in 1983, and £471,000 in 1984. The rates bill rose in 1984 because the corporation moved to its Grosvenor place premises in May 1984, and was unable to assign the lease on its previous Bolton Street offices for the remainder of that year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rates bill for BNOC and the agency for the current financial year will be less than I mentioned if the Bolton Street lease is assigned—there are hopes that it will be—or, of course, if further space is sublet at Grosvenor place as the corporation contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we need to deduct the Bolton street rates from the total to get the net rates burden for the new agency, assuming that the lease is signed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1985 rates estimate for Grosvenor Place is about £363,000, but that figure would obviously be affected if space was sublet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me how much space would be required for the new organisation. That is not for me to decide; the agency will have to make its own decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised some broader financial questions. When he talked about BNOC's losses, he seemed to be trying to have it both ways. But his hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), who has spoken about the matter both as a member of the Energy Select Committee and in our previous sitting, said that they were incurred in the national interest—indeed, for the very reasons that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney read out in the report of the chairman and chief executive of BNOC. There has been no question of trying to duck a responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman talks of Government misjudgment, Ministers' sins and propping up OPEC, he is trawling over ground which has already been well trawled over. The Select Committee has given its opinions, and the matter has been discussed on the Floor of the House in the debates on the Estimates. I shall, therefore, confine myself to discussing the consequential matters very properly raised by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what benefits would result from higher revenues through holding the price. Although it is not directly relevant to the amendment, I shall try to answer his question. It is difficult to be precise, but so long as the proportion of BNOC's spot sales does not exceed the effective tax rate, which is about 75 per cent., the extra tax receipts from maintaining a price above spot prices must ipso facto exceed BNOC's losses. That was the case in 1984, although it was not the case by February 1985 because there had been a further decline in contract sales. It is not yet possible to estimate the net loss for the first quarter of 1985, because the effective tax rate will not be known until
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
the licensees have put in their returns later in the year. I acknowledge, however, that there could be a change between the position in 1984 and that in 1985.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other hon. Members may pursue the matter further, but let me ask the Minister another simple question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By February 1985, it was already possible for the Department of Energy to claim that the losses in the, previous quarter had been more than offset. It must, therefore, have had the figures by then. Does that mean that we shall have the figures for March in a month or so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we are talking about slightly different things. The hon. Gentleman is asking for the losses against the tax receipts and so on, as opposed to the losses actually incurred by BNOC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is wrong. We are talking about exactly the same thing. culation of the reserves was not to take account of In its evidence given to the. Energy Select Committee in February, the Department said that the losses made in the summer and autumn of last year were more than offset. Obviously it had a figure by February this year about the last quarter of last year. When will it have the offset figure for the first quarter of this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to look into that further, because I am not sure of the answer and I should not like to say anything offhand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the actual figures relating to BNOC's finances and the liabilities which the new agency will take over under clause 3. The minutes laid before Parliament by my Department on 23 October 1984 and 13 February 1985 report assurances given to BNOC by the Secretary of State that he would use his powers under section 6 of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 to restore the corporation's financial reserves to an appropriate level. It was decided that that level should be £30 million, the sum that had been provided on 1 January 1983 after the separation of Britoil. In the February assurances, however, it was made clear that the calculation of the reserves was not to take account of any liabilities which accrued after the end of February.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must give me a minute to explain. He should not be so impatient. He took about 45 minutes to deploy his argument, and I have been on my feet for only about five minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been wrong to make provision in the late spring Supplementary Estimates in anticipation of losses that would continue after that date. Surely that is a matter not only of prudence, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford suggested in his intervention, but of simple propriety. It was therefore decided to restore BNOC's reserves to £30 million as at 28 February 1985. As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney freel
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
acknowledged, that was made absolutely clear in the minute placed before the Select Committee and the House. There was no question of hiding it. If the hon. Gentleman thought otherwise, he had ample opportunities to explore the matter further. But I assure him that we had no sinister motive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BNOC's losses during March amounted to £8.4 million, representing the major part of its overall loss for the year of £12 million. The hon. Gentleman asked how the figure was made up. The difference of £3.6 million is represented by a reduction between 31 December 1983 and 31 December 1984 of £300,000 in BNOC's retained profits and by net profits of £3.3 million that the corporation earnt in January and February 1985, for which provision was not made in the published accounts, but which, quite properly, were taken into account when the grant needed to restore the reserves to £30 million as at 28 February 1985 was calculated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that BNOC's reserves are now £30 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on when the liabilities are incurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asking a basic question on which I am happy for the Minister to seek advice if he wishes. He said that the appropriate reserve level of BNOC was £30 million. The figures at the bottom of the balance sheet for the 1984 accounts is £18.3 million. As a result of the changes, alterations and grants, have BNOC's reserves been restored to that level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were restored to £30 million as at 28 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of the hon. Gentleman's question is this: at the date of transfer to the new agency, what will the liabilities be and will the provisions, which I have just explained, be adequate? The corporation is not expected to be in deficit at the transfer date. We do not expect BNOC to make any significant losses after 1 April because of the manner of its trading since then, so the reserves of £30 million at the end of February should be more than adequate to enable it to absorb the losses incurred in March and to meet its other financial commitments. The provision made in the Estimates debated by the House and examined by the Select Committee should enable the corporation to finish its existence without handing over liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman admitted that his first three amendments were probing amendments and so I shall not deal with them in detail. At the time of hand-over we expect the liabilities to be very few, except those that have arisen out of trading activities in oil, for which the provision made so far should be adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible to give a definitive answer on the liabilities, but I hope that I have managed to reassure the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that the provisions in the Bill and the financial provisions made in other ways should mean that BNOC can discharge its responsibilities by the time the agency takes over what is outstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for the way that he is answering our questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the reserve figure is £30 million. What is the £18.3 million at the bottom of BNOC's balance sheet for 1984? I am happy for him to take advice and not answer immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other hon. Members may wish to speak in the debate, so perhaps I can deal with that point later. When dealing with these figures, one wants to give precise answers, and I hope that I have done so. I appreciate that these are probing amendments, to determine the precise liabilities and the steps that the Government have taken for them to be met, and, in particular, what liabilities will face the new agency which has to take them over from BNOC under the terms of clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have clarified the matters raised by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. I shall endeavour to answer the outstanding question later in the debate, and also any other further points of detail that he may raise. I do not want there to be any confusion; this is a complicated question, it covers two financial years, estimates going up to a particular date, reserves and future liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stand by what I said: we do not expect liabilities of any substance to be handed to the new agency as a result of these events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit in which the right hon. Gentleman has replied to my questions, may I give him notice of the one that he has not answered? The balance sheet shows that at the end of 1984 BNOC had current assets of £543·8 million, liabilities of £526·6 million and net assets of £18·3 million. Presumably those figures are reasonably accurate and up to date. If so, is that combination of assets, liabilities and net assets to be transferred to the agency as a result of clause 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably appropriate that I speak now, as it gives the Minister the opportunity to secure the information that my hon. Friend and other Opposition Members want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's remarks reminded me that if we allow for inflation, and turn our minds to Mr. Micawber's comments on nineteen shillings and sixpence expenditure on an income of one pound being happiness, and expenditure of one pound and six pence on an income of one pound being misery, we can see how close BNOC's margin has been and is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was rather dismissive of our amendments. He described them as probing amendments seeking only to air the subject and to secure information. However, our amendments have served another purpose; they have allowed the Committee to look into waters that are murkier than they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister approached the Committee with the utmost courtesy, and I shall describe shortly the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
difficult and embarrassing position in which the Government have placed him. However, we much regret that there are Conservative Members who have not looked at the figures carefully but have engaged in their customary superficiality, yet who have in the past, from time to time and sometimes pungently, criticised and assailed BNOC. Already this morning they have ignored similar opportunities; slanderous or almost slanderous imputations have been cast on BNOC, but not one Conservative Member has had the grace to offer some comment to show that the Conservative side of the Committee recognises that while BNOC was incurring losses it was doing so in the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when Conservative Members next meet their friends in the food distribution business, they will tell them that the practice of loss leading in supermarkets is deplorable. That they obviously strongly disapprove of the practice is evidenced by their attitude towards BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BNOC could be said to be filling the role of the Dutch boy who stuck his finger in the dyke in a valiant and swift attempt to save the community by preventing the flood. However, the Dutch boy has been not honoured but reviled in Committee by Conservative Members. The rush to dismantle BNOC has gone too far. It has now reached a point at which Conservative Members can assail good public servants and attack them for losses which they incurred deliberately to save the national interest. Yet they now do not take part in the debate, and therefore cannot balance the contemptuous remarks made in earlier sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) put forward a formidable case, and it is a pity that Conservative Members who are supposed to be present to back the Minister of State cannot offer words of support for him or even graciously qualify their earlier criticisms. My hon. Friend has asked the Minister a number of detailed questions and I wish to emphasise the points that he has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that the rates for the building normally occupied by BNOC's offices will amount to about £9,000 per employee? It may not be relevant to raise that point now, but it seems appropriate because we are dealing with figures and the question of liability. Surely it should not cost £9,000 per employee to provide an office in London. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney murmered that it would be much cheaper in Merthyr Tydfil. Indeed, it would be much cheaper in Leek, Skipton, Manchester or the metropolitan borough of Rotherham. My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) could find sites which would reduce BNOC's administrative costs to one eighth of those anticipated for 1985–86.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of those costs, a move away from London is a desirable option and, if Conservative Members wish to serve the cause of market forces, as they frequently appear to wish to do, they will join me in entreating the Minister to do his utmost to move those offices. Such a move need not be restricted to BNOC; my hon. Friend mentioned the Ministry of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
Defence, and we should consider the enormous savings that could be made. It is scarcely credible that it can cost £9,000 in rates for one person to work in an office in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our main purpose in Committee to consider such moves, but we will continue to pursue arguments for decentralisation at other times and in other places. My purpose here is to emphasise the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been too shallow in seeking to play down the serious charges presented by my hon. Friend. He suggested that ours were probing amendments and that my hon. Friend had vested our points with too much significance. But my hon. Friend has not acted excessively. His remarks need to be emphasised in the vain hope that one or two Conservative Members will acknowledge that BNOC has vigorously served the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the opening paragraph of his introduction to BNOC's 1984 annual report, Lord Croham described 1983
	<br><q><p>"as the year in which world crude oil markets experienced their most serious difficulties since the late 1970's."</p></q>
He went on to comment that
	<br><q><p>"Similar difficulties were experienced again in oil markets in 1984,"</p></q>
and made a particular reference to the position at the end of the year which
	<br><q><p>" produced a major change in the pattern of oil trading … As a result the Corporation was compelled … to sell in the spot market … and … losses were incurred."</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney pointed out—it is something the Minister has not sufficiently acknowledged—that the corporation had obtained assurances from the Secretary of State. It was promised that
	<br><q><p>"the Government would support the Corporation in these circumstances."</p></q>
But it was not made clear to Conservative Back Benchers that BNOC was pursuing a course that the Government wished it to pursue, and that the Government were giving BNOC the support which it was entitled to expect, given the policies that it was required to pursue. It was a fairly squalid business for Conservative Members to kick and cast slurs on BNOC, when it was doing what the Government wanted and was supposed to be enjoying the Government's support. I hope that Conservative Members will withdraw the insults and assaults in which they have already indulged in Committee. I also hope that the Minister will make it clear to Conservative Members that they could well adopt the same attitude as was adopted by Conservative Members on the Select Committee on Energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) is not in his place. As a member of the Select Committee and a Government supporter, he could perhaps side with the Minister of State in this matter, instead of appearing to endorse by his absence the more villainous and vituperative comments of some of his hon. Friends. The corporation did not have freedom of action, but Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
Back Benchers certainly have the freedom to withdraw their unpleasant comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is possible, can the Minister give the Committee estimates of the losses incurred in the last quarter? If he cannot do so, will he ensure that the House is given this information on Report, or that my hon. Friend receives it between now and Report? The matter is important, and will loom large in our consideration of the Bill on Report. On Report, the Minister should give a detailed account of the work, the intervention and the losses accepted by BNOC with the full support and encouragement of the Secretary of State, and make it absolutely clear to any Conservative Members who wish to attack BNOC simply because it is in the public sector, that in doing so they are also attacking the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to give further thought to LPG. I accept that the Government have decided to relieve the agency of responsibility for LPG. Will the residual expertise in the agency allow it to advise both producers and any company that emerges? On Tuesday evening, we heard that Shell may be acting as the marketing manager for small producers. But residual expertise may still be available. I trust that the Minister will not prevent the new agency from offering advice at a time when the market is changing. Significant research might be under way with the use of liquefied petroleum gases for chemical feedstocks. BNOC should advise the market whether that is a permanent change which will develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about whether liabilities will loom too large. The Minister is not responsible for the gas industry, but what I shall say is relevant to his responsibilities. There is a great deal of uncertainty amongst those concerned with gas because of the latest lunatic proposal of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few months ago, my hon. Friends and I were aware of an important development in British Gas —a highly efficient organisation with a concern for research—which is of international significance in relation to pipe inspection. I am not a technician, and perhaps other Committee members cannot fully appreciate the astonishing complexities overcome by the achievements of British Gas in relation to pipeline inspection. I am concerned that there should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
a satisfactory home base for the on-line inspection so ably and commendably pioneered by British Gas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 9 of BNOC's report shows some of the developments last year. Its major projects were
	<br><q><p>" rehabilitating additional storage for system use, are approaching completion. … The rolling programme to modernise the telecommunication system, which is in its second year, is continuing satisfactorily. … The five new mainline pumps, recently installed under the second phase of the modernisation programme, are now fully operational."</p></q>
Those are obviously necessary and commendable and will perhaps be reflected in the matters touched upon—property rights and liabilities—in clause 3—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The projects I quoted show up the need for investments in the telecommunications system, mainline pumps and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to trespass on your goodwill, Mr. Knox, or to repeat any of the matters that concerned us when we considered the history of the pipeline system. In the postwar years a great deal of work had to be done and a great deal of expenditure incurred because maintenance was a reaction to weakness rather than a prevention of difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The splendid achievement in pipeline inspection developed by British Gas should be able to go ahead apace. One problem with our economy is that we have allowed other people to take enormous commercial advantage of the invented achievements of our industry and higher education. I am sure that every member of the Committee could think of at least six British inventions which have not been adequately commercially exploited in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have examined the pipeline inspection capacity and ability developed by British Gas and I think that if we can develop a home market of adequate size, it will be of considerable benefit. I know that some Conservative Members would not welcome such a commercial market because they would rather see the public sector activity make a loss before privatisation. However, national interest should come first and I hope that the Minister will not take such a hard view of transfer and liability that he discourages the new agency's constitution towards
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
the establishment of an adequate home base. The development of British Gas PIGS is relevant and I hope that the Minister will consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that I have spoken long enough to allow the Minister's advisers to give him a good deal of the information sought by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that my speech will have reminded Conservative Members that they have not been fair to the British National Oil Corporation. They have cast a slur upon it and criticised it. The Opposition have demonstrated clearly, as has the annual report, that BNOC acted in an entirely patriotic manner. If Conservative Members approve of patriotism, I am sure that they will wish to withdraw some of their criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney took us into very murky waters. I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation—indeed, I do not think that it was a proper explanation—in answer to the serious point made by my hon. Friend about the events of 13 February and 5 March. It was a very interesting period in which the Government seem to have suffered a sea change. The casualty was BNOC. We are therefore entitled to expect Conservative Members to explain their accusations or to withdraw them. It would be rather squalid if they sat in silence now. I look forward to the Minister's answers to our questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) made two specific points: one on liquid petroleum gas and one on the maintenance of the pipeline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made the position clear on LPG earlier. We intend that the agency should not continue its LPG activities. The hon. Gentleman asked about advice. Obviously, if the advice is relevant it will be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is labouring under a misapprehension about the Gritish Gas system of pipeline maintenance. Investment in that is irrelevant to BNOC's accounts. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State makes those investments and BNOC simply acts as the agent operating the system. My right hon. Friend and I appreciate the benefit of some of the systems that British Gas has developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the close of his remarks, the hon. Gentleman returned to the question of dates. To have sought to make provision in an estimate before Parliament in February for a subsequent period for which prices were not known—at that time no prices had been established for March and we would therefore have been seeking to cover a loss which at that time was purely hypothetical—would have been an abuse. Opposition Members can play around that point, but what really matters is the restoration of the reserves and the ability of BNOC during the remainder of its life to continue operating without additional funds. That is the heart of the matter. We believe that sufficient provision will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that any fair-minded person looking at the situation from a fresh viewpoint would consider that, if the Government promised to reimburse BNOC for losses

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
incurred in pursuing the national interest, they should have done so in full?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, but within the context set, at the end of the day there is a reserve figure of £30 million. As I made clear and as was made clear in the minute, the amount of reserves was relevant. The reserves remain for BNOC to use during the rest of its life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) raised the question of the £18·3 million which appears in the accounts. It is worth remembering that it represents to some extent a balancing item between some very large sums of money. Those sums are related to the fact that in any accounting period BNOC owes money in oil lifted and, equally, it will be owed money for oil it has sold but has not yet been paid for. Obviously the current liabilities and assets are a large sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the oil that has been sold but not paid for. How do currency fluctuations affect that? Is there a loss or a profit if it goes up or down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contract is made with either the supplier or the purchaser; there is a period of time between the contract and the payment of the sum. BNOC pays its suppliers some 30 days after lifting the oil, but it has already made its arrangements with them. One must also bear in mind that all the negotiations are in dollars as all oil is traded in dollars. The point that the hon. Gentleman was making does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accounts show that after the grants had been paid by my Department, the corporation had capital reserves at the end of the year of £18·3 million. That, of course, is after provision in the accounts for all oil trading losses incurred in the first quarter of this year. That is how the corporation chose to present its accounts. The same figure of £18·3 million represents the corporation's financial position at the end of March. That answers the hon. Gentleman's question. I should add that that could be adjusted, depending on any profits—or otherwise—in its other business, and any interests that may be accrued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than detain the Committee, perhaps the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney should look at note 4 to the accounts, particularly the final paragraph, which states very clearly how the £183 million was arrived at. The corporation has chosen to present its accounts in that way. The reserves are broadly the same at the end of March as shown in the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right to take it that BNOC's capital reserves in 1983 were £30.3 million? It now appears that, in March, the corporation's capital reserves were £18.3 million. Is that right? So how does it now have a £30 million capital reserve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to the final paragraph of note 4, which says:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
	<br><q><p>"Because of the circumstances described above, including the Corporation's contractual arrangements with its suppliers, provision has been reflected in the 1984 accounts for losses accruing in the first quarter of 1985 (£49·8 million) and related grant receivable (£38·1 million). These provisions were not taken into account in establishing the amount of the Corporation's net assets at 31 December 1984 for the purposes of determining the amount of grant receivable, and accordingly the Corporation's net assets at 31 December 1984 as shown in these accounts fall short of £30 million by the net amount of the provisions (£11·7 million)."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So £18·3 million was the December figure, but it reflected the problems of the first quarter of 1985. It is curious that the figure is still £18·3 million at the end of March, after all the grants were taken into account—or has it been topped up to £30 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is £18.3 million. I am beginning to feel like the chairman of BNOC talking to his shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That answer is not satisfactory, and I do not understand it. The Minister said earlier that the purpose of all these grants and financial arrangements was to restore the corporation's capital reserve to £30 million, and that that had happened. He then explained that the figure of £18.3 million for December 1984 did not take into account the fact that all the losses had been brought forward into the first quarter, and that with all the grants it should be back at £30 million. But on 31 March it had not gone back to £30 million—or has it? That is all I am asking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it has not, because the corporation took into account all its losses up to the end of March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But with grants it would go back up to £30 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because of the explanation that I gave earlier. It was £30 million on 28 February/ 1 March, but that figure must be adjusted by the losses accruing during March, which reduces it to £18·3 million. Note 4 covers the losses for the first quarter of 1985.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But note 4 says:
	<br><q><p>"these accounts fall short of £30 million by the net amount of the provisions (£11·7 million)."</p></q>
Is the present capital reserve of the corporation at the appropriate level of £30 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is £18·3 million. I said that, as at 28 February when the estimates were prepared and subsequently reviewed in the light of the decision to abolish BNOC, that reserve figure was adequate to cover the losses for the month of March, the third month of the accounting period, and should be adequate—although one cannot be sure at this stage—to cover any other losses incurred between the end of March and the rest of BNOC's life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now clear that the Government have not restored, and do not intend to restore, the capital reserve base of BNOC to £30 million. That was not clear from the way that the right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
hon. Gentleman presented it. I was puzzled when he said that reserves were back to £30 million as at 28 February when the figures showed that the net reserves were £18·3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reserves have not been restored to £30 million. From the nods of assent, I presume that that is the position, and will remain so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be acquitted of any charge of being unreasonable, I want to make the following point. From remarks made in the House, before the Select Committee, in public comment and in the chairman's comment in BNOC's report, we were all led of believe that the Government would compensate BNOC for any losses incurred. Note 4 to the accounts, to which the Minister of State has drawn attention, says:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State confirmed that the resulting losses would be partially offset."</p></q>
In the following paragraph there is also a reference to losses being " partially offset".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Energy Select Committee and anyone interested in the subject understood that the Government would compensate in full; now it appears that the Government will not compensate in full and that from the start the offset was to be partial. It is a pity that that was not made clear at the beginning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was absolutely clear in the minute, which said that the Government would restore the position up to 28th February. What could be clearer than that? That has always been the position. It was on the basis of that minute that I appeared before the Select Committee and that the House debated the Select Committee's report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the word " partial " appeared, but in any case it is insufficiently presented. If that is the form of words that the Government used in the first place, it is a pity that they allowed a misconception to become widely established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister may have referred the matter to the February date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did; there is no " may " about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but the Minister has allowed a considerable misconception to occur, and that misconception may have contributed to the serious criticism that some of his hon. Friends have levelled at BNOC, and which he did not directly deplore, as I believe that he should have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A certain amount of confusion has been created, not by our ignorance but by ministerial remarks and observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not accept the Minister's half-hearted explanation. I point out to my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) that on 13 February the Government stated that
	<br><q><p>"no account would be taken of any liabilities which accrue"</p></q>
The Minister has not explained that adequately. He said that it would have been improper to anticipate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
expenditure; in that case, surely, the minute should have read:
	<br><q><p>"No account has yet been taken of any liabilities which accrue in respect of the period after the end of February."</p></q>
The Minister should have said that he did not yet know the position and would have to come to the House to explain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, according to the minute, the Government had decided to draw the line on BNOC at the end of February and were not willing to accept any liability for their decisions or actions after the end of February. That is why we believe that it had already been decided to abolish BNOC a month before any announcement was made. I do not like using the word " misled ", but the evidence that the Minister gave to the Select Committee is certainly not consistent with events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept, however, that there will be provision for transitional accounting. Under schedule 3, the agency must produce interim accounts for the period after March. I feel that the Minister has given us sufficient assurances on the agency's potential liabilities, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 2, line 35, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
	<br><q><p>"(2) Reference in this Act to property, rights and liabilities are references to all contracts, and rights in relation to the Corporation's activities in trading in participation petroleum and national gas liquids in force at the transfer date. The Agency shall exercise those rights and undertake those obligations until they expire.".</p></q>
The amendment is another attempt to find out exactly what will happen when the transfer takes place and the agency inherits a number of outstanding contracts and arrangements which have not yet been unravelled. It is defective in one respect: I should have liked to include the question of commercial contracts here rather than raising it on clause stand part. Although the amendment covers only participation agreements, I hope that the Minister will not object if I deal with both subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides an opportunity for us to take stock of where we stand in relation to both participation agreements and outstanding incremental commercial agreements made between BNOC and a whole range of companies. As its annual report shows, BNOC collected 435,000 barrels of participation oil after saleback from participation agreement after election notices had been served. Such notices are served on a 12-month or six-month basis, and not all of them might have been unravelled by the time of transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know how many of those arrangements have been unravelled. According to the report, a considerable percentage of the participation arrangements have already been dealt with: I am sure that the big boys have moved in quickly, saying, " Yes, we are happy for you to terminate the arrangements and we will take our participation oil back." However, there may be smaller companies which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
have participation agreements and which have had notice served on them but which do not want to be rushed into having their contracts unravelled in such a short time—or at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what percentage of the 435,000 barrels a day has been returned to the oil companies so far and what percentage left outstanding? Many of the smaller companies have commercial contracts making up the 175,000 barrels a day of commercial oil that BNOC traded in. Some of the contracts were made for the life of the fields. For example, in the Brent, Thistle, Dunlin, Hutton and Murchison fields agreements have been made for small quantities of oil. There is the Charterhall Ultramar agreement for 4,000 to 5,000 barrels a day under fee deals for the life of the field. As I understand it, the Bill does not override such contracts, which can only be unravelled voluntarily by the companies concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 3, the contracts will be transferred to the agency. Will the Minister assure the Committee that if those companies wish to maintain their contracts for the life of the field no effort will be made to pressurise them into terminating them and that the contracts will be inherited by the agency? Will the Minister assure us that he will not apply any form of arm-twisting to persuade the companies to unwind their contracts, whether for participation or for commercial oil?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sale of BP's assets, under Operation Sword, a collection of small companies took a piece of the action. A total of about 10,000 barrels a day is covered by such small purchases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BNOC has locked-in agreements with those small companies to take all their oil, and if the companies do not wish to terminate those contracts—I presume they can only be terminated by agreement—no pressure must be put on by the Department of Energy or the Minister to force the agency to unravel deals that were made for the life of the field. For example, 15,000 barrels a day of participation oil from the Brae field alone go to the small companies under long-term lock-in provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another group in the Brae field is made up of Kier McGee, Westar and Sovereign, and all have long-term arrangements with BNOC for both participation and commercial oil. Westar as a trader on behalf of small companies gave evidence to the Select Committee, supporting the role of BNOC. I hold no brief for Westar, I have no clue who runs the company—I have never met them—but Westar says that it wants to maintain the contracts signed that it signed in good faith with BNOC on a long-term basis for both participation and commercial oil. Will the agency inherit the contracts and, also, will the Minister assure us that he will use none of the pressures open to him to get small companies to give up their contracts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the contracts suit the companies, they should be allowed to continue with them. I hope that the Minister will not exercise the clandestine pressure available to him by mumbling something about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
tenth licensing round. I hope that he will accept in good faith that the contracts are signed and that he will confirm in honour that they will be inherited by the agency and continue until the companies wish to unravel them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not right that the options must be exercised by BNOC in the first instance and that if BNOC and, in turn, the agency do not exercise the options, they are not taking up the requirements of contractual agreements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those arrangements refer only to participation oil. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that under the Minister's direction the agency can terminate participation oil agreements when their election notices fall due. However, some agreements for participation oil are for life. Will the Minister confirm that some companies in the North sea agreed on much longer, if not permanent, notices? If so, my point becomes even more valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some arrangements are subject to ordinary six or 12-month participation notices and, given the Minister's policy statement, it would be proper for him to direct that such participation notices lapse at the end of their terms. If that is what the companies want, let it be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that some participation arrangements with small companies are not based on the usual six to 12-month periods, but are locked in by agreement for the life of the fields for both commercial and participation oil. First, will the Minister confirm that that is so? Secondly, will he confirm that he and the agency will not try to force small companies to break contractual arrangements that they wish to maintain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of such arrangements in the Buchan fields, where 5,000 barrels a day are under long-term fee arrangements. Goal and Charterhall are entitled to 400 to 500 barrels in the Norh sea. I hope that the Minister will agree that no pressure will be brought to end those agreements against the companies' wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liquid petroleum gas contracts are often for much longer terms than participation agreements. The minimum noice on all LPG contracts was 12 months. BNOC traded with 36 companies in LPG. Some bought both commercial and participation LPG. Others bought on varying terms for different periods. Again, I ask a simple question and seek a simple assurance. Will the Minister confirm that he will not apply direct or indirect pressure on companies to break contractual arrangements that they find sensible and adequate for their needs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, the agency inherits all the con-contracts, so I hope that the Minister will give us those assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) asked how many of BNOC's arrangements in tradeable oil had been unravelled. Some 80 per cent. have now been unravelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is true that some participation arrangements last for the life of fields. Thirdly, when.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
agreements do not lapse automatically at the end of their periods or contracts, changes or terminations at earlier dates must be effected by negotiation. At present, it is up to BNOC to negotiate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, under clause 3, anything outstanding will be taken over by the agency, which will have a duty to dispose of any existing commercial commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come back to the matter on clause 4(1), which says

What if the other parties do not want those contracts to be discharged or disposed of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That must be done by negotiation in the same way as any other contract. LPG is covered in exactly the same way as other agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The negotiations are up BNOC as present apd will be up to the agency when it takes over.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would appear from clause 4 that there is no obligation or pressure on the Minister. Is not the pressure from the legislation itself? Clause 4(1) says:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be the duty of the Agency to dispose"</p></q>
not the duty of the Minister. Parliament is resolving this and so it is not necessary for pressure to be brought by the Minister in this connection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better not stray into clause 4, although we have already done so briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the transfer of
	<br><q><p>"all the property, rights and liabilities"</p></q>
under clause 3 meant the contracts. I think that it is appropriate to raise the question of the transfer of the contracts to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not given me the assurance that I seek. He could mumble at a cocktail party to the poor representatives of companies such as Westar, " Are you being difficult about agreeing to the disposal by the agency of the outstanding contract? You are incurring my displeasure because I do not want the agency to do that. You realise, of course, that we shall take note of that and that the tenth round of licensing is coming up." Ministers can use that type of pressure on small outfits and I hope that the Minister of State can assure us that he has no intention of exercising such pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

suggestion that we should not keep bobbing up and down, I should perhaps take rather longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It was not a suggestion, but a rule of the House. The hon. Gentleman has been a Member of the House for 15 years-.as I have —and I am sure that he recognises that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want you to feel that I was being unco-operative, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 64 deserves a few words, but I shall be as brief as possible. We have to draw the Committee's attention to the words of subsection (3):
	<br><q><p>"It is hereby declared for the avoidance of doubt".</p></q>
That is a most commendable sentiment. I have served on a number of Standing Committees since I entered the House 15 years ago. I have never seen a Bill so surrounded by doubt and furtive secrecy as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is delightful that in clause 3(3), doubt is to be avoided—a commendable sentiment, except that it is not matched in the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are particularly anxious that there should be no doubt about the position of overseas properties accruing to the agency which might have to be sold off so that the agency can discharge its commitments under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need information about the property. I have never bought or sold a shop, and neither do I intend to do so, but when a shop is on the market, it is sold with stock and goodwill. Is there any goodwill involved in this transaction? Goodwill is supposed to be an asset, even though it is intangible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As BNOC has been a major world trader in oil, it will have established relationships and thus good-will which will be dissipated by the Government for no payment. The disposal or destruction of the intangible assets will bring no advantage to Britain. It appears that the Government have not even recognised that there could be significant intangible assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is property overseas, the Secretary of State should advise the agency to exercise flexibility over the timing of a disposal. A disposal means that there may be an unwilling seller, but that there has to be a willing buyer. That buyer may be particularly willing. If we rush the agency into a disposal, any advantage accruing from it would be minimised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although doubt should be avoided, financial disadvantage could result from the Government's insistence on the removal of flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us whether he esteems the current assets of the corporation at home or abroad, whether he has taken any intangible assets into account and whether he agrees that flexibility should not be taken away from the agency so that both the agency and the country could suffer disadvantage from the disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) has moved the amendment. When I saw the first edition of the Bill, I asked why these words had to be put in, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
what property BNOC owned outside the country, as I was not aware of it. The hon. Gentleman and I obviously have similar minds and homed in on the same point. I was satisfied with the explanation I was given, and I hope that the Committee will share my view, though that is unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In preparing the Bill, we asked the corporation whether it had property outside the United Kingdom, and it confirmed that it had no such property rights or liabilities and did not expect to acquire any before the transfer. However, it pointed out that the Bill should cover the posisbility of property being acquired between the Bill's preparation and the demise of BNOC, which is why the provision has been included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision could operate if BNOC acquired during trading a volume of crude oil which was stored at a foreign terminal at the time of the transfer date. Such eventualities occur in the normal trading of BNOC, and that is what we are trying to cover. I shared the hon. Gentleman's doubts, as the reason for the words was not evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine that goodwill would attach to that volume of oil at that time, but if the agency took that over as an asset, I am sure that it would act with proper commercial prudence and flexibility to make sure that the asset was realised in the best possible interests in performing its functions as an agency of the Secretary of State. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not taken too long on clause 3 and I do not wish to spend long on clause stand part. I want only to ask one simple question. We have not tabled amendments on it, so we are seeking an explanation from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 provides for a transitional period. Schedule 2 tries to deal with the problems of the transitional period. Can the Minister give us some idea of the time scale between the Bill's enactment and the transfer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to answer that question specifically. It depends when the Bill is passed. If it completes its legislative stages by the summer recess, much of the preparatory work will have been done. If it finishes later, ever more will have been done. The Secretary of State must bear that in mind when fixing the transfer date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a transitional period because BNOC will not be abolished immediately after the transfer date. It will have a duty to prepare its final report and accounts during that period and it may require extra time to secure the best arrangement for the agency for residual property, rights or liabilities. All such matters are of a housekeeping nature and are covered by the Bill. I cannot predict precisely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
how long they will take, but I assure the Committee that they will be effected as expeditiously as possible. We do not want the two systems running parallel for too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 2</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROVISIONS SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 3</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Second Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of the schedule is self-explanatory and we debated some aspects of paragraph 2 on an earlier amendment on transfer of contracts of employment. We are still dissatisfied with the way the Government have chosen to ignore our pleas and not to treat BNOC's staff in a way that would have been preferable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the Minister tell us how many staff have agreed to transfer, how many will be made redundant and how many are in an either-or position? Secondly, paragraph 3(6) says:
	<br><q><p>"Any expenses incurred by the Corporation … shall be met by the Agency."</p></q>
Will the agency bear all the expenses incurred by the corporation during the transitional period, or only those directly relating to the cost of the transfer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the next section, which deals with wrapping up the corporation's accounts, I hope that the Minister will exercise what control he can. There will be a final set of accounts from the corporation. Given the muddle we got ourselves into over BNOC's reserves, I hope that he will ensure that the final set of accounts lays out BNOC's position in the clearest terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has just made. The Committee would be obliged if the Minister could now, and again on Report, tell us the precise numbers of staff who will remain, who have secured alternative employment or who are currently facing the prospect of redundancy or unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the corporation is winding-up and the agency is establishing itself and the question of property is uppermost in the minds of those who are staying. I trust that the Minister will not prevent it from considering whether it should remain in London. I view of the information we have given and the remarks that we have made about the enormous administrative cost, it would be an appropriate time for the matter to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also endorse the point that my hon. Friend made about the financial arrangements. I notice in the schedule that the corporation is still re-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
quired to provide a detailed report in its final year. I trust that that report will be full and detailed because the financial events at the beginning of the year are of considerable public importance. My hon. Friend did us a great service in making that request during his brief remarks. I trust that the Minister will note those requests carefully and that the Committee will be given the relevant and detailed information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will also make it clear that the corporation, in its final compilation, will be free to make the most frank and detailed presentation of the events in which it has been involved. Furthermore, I hope that the Minister, despite the enormous power that the Bill has already vested in him, will not exercise that power in any way to prevent the corporation from doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) said about location is a matter for the agency. It will, obviously take note of what he said, but I hope that he remembers that staff are transferring from BNOC to the agency and they are already based in London. However, the final decision rests with the agency. I consider it likely that it will remain in London for that and a number of other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) raised three points. I am not able to give the hon. Geptleman the information that he asks for about the current staff position. It is the responsibility of the management of BNOC. Negotiations and discussions are proceeding. As he knows, it is only a week or so since I announced who the new chairman was. It would be premature to give the hon. Gentleman the information that he is asking for, but I certainly understapd his interest. If it is appropriate at some stage to give that information I shall bear in mind his request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked me about the costs of the transitional period. Those are met by the agency. Paragraphs 3(6) and 4(5) of the schedule cover that. He also asked me about the final accounts. I can confirm that BNOC will be preparing final accounts. I cannot say whether they will be presented in an immediately understandable form, because they will have to be presented in accordance with proper accounting procedure. However, judging by its present accounts and the report from which the hon. Member for Wentworth quoted so freely, BNOC is quite capable of speaking for itself. I have no doubt that the accounts will be fully and properly presented, and will help to answer some of the hypothetical questions which have been very properly been raised today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should the agency be responsible for all expenses incurred in preparing BNOC's accounts, as laid down in paragraph 4(5)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By that time BNOC will not have any money, and the agency will have to carry the responsibility for its expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
