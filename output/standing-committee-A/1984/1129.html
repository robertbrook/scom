</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 5, in page 4, line 2, leave out from " means " to end of line 3 and add
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"a democratically elected local authority."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Tyne Bridge): When we were so rudely interrupted by the clock on Tuesday, the Minister of State, Welsh Office, had just said that many local authorities might not welcome the idea of responsibilties being vested in them, as suggested in the amendment. That is a valid point, but as I pointed out, it is significant that they were not consulted. Moreover, if local authorities do not wish to be consulted, as our amendment proposes, there is no need to do so as the proposed new paragraph 7(1)(b) states that the Minister may
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"vest in himself … or any accountable public authority".</p></q>
The amendment seeks to define clearly that " accountable public authority ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if some local authorities do not want responsibilties vested in them, as the Minister of State fears, under our amendment the Minister could discuss it with them and then vest them in himself. So. while the Minister's point is valid, there is no substance in it because our amendment says that the accountable public authority should be democratically and locally elected. To the Opposition, that is more important that passing on that vested interest to a body that the Minister controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State wishes to vest in himself—we do not agree with that—surely it is not necessary to have another provision to enable him to pass on the vested interest that he controls. What is the difference? He is virtually vesting in himself in any case. The Minister did not address himself to that point. New paragraph 7(1)(b) states that the Secretary of State may
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"vest in himself, any other Minister of the Crown or any accountable public authority ".</p></q>
Yet new paragraph 7(7) defines " accountable public authority " as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
	<br><q><p>"any statutory corporation a majority of the members of which are appointed by a Minister of the Crown."</p></q>
If the Secretary of State has the power to vest in himself, why does he need an extra power to vest in a corporation that he controls? That is fundamentally wrong and it should not be included in the Bill. If anything is to be vested in any body, that body should be the local authority. If, when the Minister discusses the matter with it, it does not want those responsibilities, he then has the power to vest them in himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New paragraph 7(7) seems to be a nice get-out for the Minister because if it looks a little dodgy—I put it no stronger than that—to vest in himself, he has a nice little loophole that enables him to pass on the matter to a corporation, which appears to be outside his control but is really controlled by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not a loophole, I do not not know what is. If something looks as though it will catch the public eye or someone may become upset about it and the Minister does not want to be in the front line because he may be shot at, he has a nice little loophole so that he can pass on the criticism and say, " It's not me, it's that public authority over there." Only on reading the small print does one realise that the Minister has passed the power to himself, but without getting any of the flack. That is what we believe is the implication of this part of the Bill, and it is one reason why we shall push the amendment to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall repeat again and again and again that the more power we give to Ministers without any redress or opportunity to question them and to put them in the front line, the more powers will pass away from Members of Parliament. This measure is another example of that danger. The Bill and many others—the Minister is not alone—that are passing through the House give powers to Ministers. One wonders if the day will arrive when we shall not need Committees. We shall have a one-line Bill that says, " The Minister shall do anything he wants." We shall pass that clause and go home, full stop. There will be no democratic decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By carrying the amendments, we shall put reins on the Minister—I put it no stronger—so that every time he acts he must justify what he does. That is good for the Bill, for democracy and for Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Welwyn Hatfield): May I briefly hold up progress on the clause? Although I welcome it on behalf of my constituents, on Second Reading I put two proposals to my hon. Friend the Minister. As they are both relevant to the clause, will my hon. Friend take the opportunity to comment on them? First, would it be possible for an end date to be given to the involvement of the commission in each of the new towns. Secondly, would it not be possible to extend the powers of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to cover the work of the commission?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I fully welcome the clause, I wonder whether my hon. Friend could comment briefly on those two points as it would be of great value to my constituents and, I suspect, to many other people living in new towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr. Ian Gow)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be a matter of very deep concern to the Committee that we do not have the benefit of the advice of the official spokesman for the Liberal party. We were deprived of that benefit when we first met on Tuesday. The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) and I have discussed this and wonder what inquiries you have made, Sir Philip, to make certain that the notification that has been received by other members of the Committee telling us when and where we are to meet has been received by the official spokesman for the Liberal party. I pause, Sir Philip, because the Committee is hanging on your reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his interesting question, but it does not relate to clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was because it did not relate to the clause that I rose on a point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respond to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy). Of course, it would be possible in law to extend the jurisdiction of the ombudsman. However, to do so would not be within the long title of the Bill. If my hon. Friend were to seek to table a new clause to that effect, Sir Philip, I rather think that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
you might not accept it. With regard to the end date, it is not possible to give one now because it would weaken the negotiating position of the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not intend to have a long debate on the clause. It is interesting that a Tory Member has actually held up the Bill. I hope that we can look forward to that on other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the Minister's concern about the absence of the Liberal spokesman. May I through you, Sir Philip, suggest a course of action to facilitate finding the missing man? Would it be possible to insert in the missing persons column of all the daily and evening newspapers a large advertisement in a number of languages to cover all eventualities to see whether we can establish the whereabouts of the hon. Member? He spoke so passionately on Second Reading that I expected to find him here before me—and I always come early. The only conclusion I can reach is that he came in, saw the empty seats and decided that he was in the wrong Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another course of action suggests itself to me. Would it be possible, Sir Philip, for you to instruct one of the Officers to search the Committee Corridor to see whether the hon. Member is the the wrong Room? I should hate to think of him making a speech in another Room about this Bill. We are deeply concerned: I shall not rest tonight until someone has established the whereabouts of the missing hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for the Chair to inquire into absences from the Committee.

	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 6 is a purely drafting amendment—the substance of our case is, obviously, amendment No. 7. I shall speak to amendment No. 7 and, depending on the Minister's reply, we shall press for a Division. However, we shall not press a Division on amendment No. 6, as it is simply a drafting amendment—we are not playing games.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It never ceases to amaze me with such Bills to hear the Minister putting a case for terminating something. Here he seeks the power to wind up the new towns and, eventually, the Commission for the New Towns. We disagree with that, but that is what the Bill proposes. On Second Reading, when he spoke about how to terminate the commission, the answer that he received from his own Benches was, " quick, quick, or quicker ". I do not agree with that, but I should have thought that the Minister would respond to his own troops. Certainly he got the Bill into Committee in record time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, how can the Minister justify giving nominating rights for houses for five years to the commission, which has been wound up? Surely, if he genuinely intends to wind up the commission, he should wind up the nominating rights with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (7B) states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"The corporation's right of nominating tenants shall he exercisable during the following period or periods ".</p></q>
Amendment No. 6 seeks to delete the phrase " or periods ". However, new subsection (7B)(b) states that where the corporation is the commission and the dwellings in question were transferred from the development corporation to the district council, the corporation will be able to nominate tenants for a period of five years beginning with that transfer date. That could mean that the houses would be transferred to the district council, which under normal circumstances would manage them. However, although the Commission for the New Towns—an outside body—would have given over the management, it would have nominating rights for five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the significance of that? Is it necessary? If the properties have been transfered and the district council is to manage them it should exercise all the management functions for them. If the new town had been managing them, there may have been a reason for it to nominate tenants, but the commission is quite remote from the district council that is looking after those houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, having wound up the new town or development corporation, the Minister will vest its assets in the commission. That was the function and idea of the new commission. For want of a better word, it will be a holding company, to which will be transferred the assets of the new towns and the development corporations. Its remit is to get rid of those assets as fast as possible—presumably at any price. If that is the case, why are nominating
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
rights being vested in a remote Commission for the New Towns?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know where the headquarters of the commission are to be, but it certainly cannot have offices in every—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Mid-Worcestershire): You should do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should—I should know where the spokesman for the Liberal party is, but I do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably the commission's office will be in London. I hazard a guess that it will, but whether it is in London or in Timbuktu it cannot be close to the actual dwellings. It could happen that the district councils manage all the property, and that an unknown body, far remote from the action, has nominating rights for five years. That seems fundamentally wrong. If transfers are to be made, they should be of all the functions, including nominating rights. It could be argued that a period of 12 months during the transfer period would be reasonable and sensible. If assets are transferred piecemeal to the commission, over perhaps 12 months, that is understandable and justifiable, but a period of five years is ridiculous. How was it arrived at? Did someone just pluck a figure out of the air and say, " Put five years into the Bill "? Can any case be substantiated for a period of five years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 5, new subsection (7B)(c) states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"where the corporation are the Commission and the dwellings in question were transferred from them to the district council, the period of 5 years beginning with the date on which the Commission's interest in the transferred dwellings vests in the district council."</p></q>
Again, the Government have plucked this mythical five years from the air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I await, with bated breath, not only for the arrival of our non-existent comrade-in-arms, but to hear what the Minister says to justify that decision. Will he tell us whether he discussed the matter with the district councils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State, Welsh Office, said that many district councils would not like to have property transferred to them. That is a fair argument, but it works both ways. If the commission is to take nominating rights for a mythical five years, we want to know whether that was discussed with the district councils, and if not, why not. Having accepted what the Minister said in one context, I am bound to throw the argument back at the Minister for Housing and Construction and ask him whether he discussed the matter with the district councils, what they said and what possible justification there is for the five-year nominating rights period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee notes with what care Her Majesty's present Ministers study that which was enacted by those who in past times advised her. We decided on five years because we thought it a sensible period and it was one which had been selected by the Government of which the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) was so distinguished a member. We have followed precisely the precedent set out in section 7(2)(b) of the New Towns (Amendment) Act 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I shall explain to him why the Government believe that the powers of nomination should still be conferred on the commission. We believe that having those nomination rights may actually increase the prospects of employment in the new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other aspects of housing transfer schemes, nomination rights become, under the Bill, a matter for agreement between the two parties making the transfersthe local authorities and the development corporations. The importance of nomination rights is that when a development corporation or the commission are trying to attract new industry to a town, it may be important for them to be able to guarantee to a prospective employer housing for some key workers who are needed to set up the new undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge rightly asked about district councils. I stress that these nomination rights will always be the subject of agreement between the district council involved and the development corporation or the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause recognises that although the development of a town has to be substantially complete when the commission takes over, that does not mean that there is no further need for development. Corby proved that. The provision of housing for key workers may be a crucial factor in attracting new industrial and commercial development. Much of the success of new town development depends on bringing together as many factors as possible under the control of a single body. It may make sense for the commission, therefore, to have some nomination rights at its disposal. With that explanation of our concern about jobs and our wish to bring key workers to towns, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the Minister's last comments because, to be honest, I have never heard so much balderdash in all my life. We already have local authorities that work with industrial developers and people who want to develop job opportunities in communities. Local authorities that are housing authorities work with developers, industrialists and commercial undertakings to provide accommodation for key workers. As the Minister is aware, that has happened in local authorities for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Minister to say that there are fears that in new towns the principle of co-operation between housing authorities and prospective developers will not continue is to mislead both himself and the Committee. The Minister's reason is one of the weakest that I have heard for trying to write a provision into a Bill. I am sure that in new town areas, where there is plenty of experience, local authorities, that will be responsible for housing, will work with developers on job opportunities to increase employment. Local authorities will work at that task equally as well in new town areas as they do elsewhere, in both district and metropolitan areas, where they have housing responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister believes that the five-year period should be included in the Bill as a safeguard, he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
need have no fears in accepting the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) which would remove the offensive clause. There is a precedent of co-operation throughout the country in trying to stimulate job opportunities by offering housing accommodation to key workers, both in the public and private sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of authorities, especially Labour authorities, work with people who are transferring into the area to take up a job, or because of the prospect of a job. The Minister should have no fear that district councils will not work with those who want to develop job opportunities in a particular area. I feel sure that the co-operation shown in other parts of the country will continue in the new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to follow the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge in moving the amendment. If the corporation is to be wound up, if its work is to cease, we should consider housing with great care. The clause deals solely with housing. The amendments aim to help the tenants and would-be tenants of the new towns. The transfer of housing to local authorities, which have plenty of experience of housing administration, is right. If the corporation is to be wound up the quicker the housing is transferred to those experienced local authorities the better.

During the Second Reading debate the spokesman for the Liberal-SDP alliance, the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), spoke keenly on this issue. It is surprising that he is absent today in view of the determination he showed in attacking the Minister. It is indicative of the alliance approach to housing in local government. It is all wind and strong words when its members speak in the Chamber. I have to join with the Minister and with my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge in condemning the way that the alliance give great importance to housing when the press are present but are absent when it comes to doing the work of drafting the Bill in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend find it significant that even if the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. I am sure that we shall receive some amendments when the hon.

I hope that that will be noticed.

I said earlier that the clause is about housing. I should like to make one point to the Minister which relates to housing. The Minister is aware—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to make general points about housing rather than relating his comments to these two new subsections. He has been completely

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
in order so far, and I hope that he will remain SO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall indeed, Sir Philip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new subsection (7B) it is suggested that the commission should continue with the nomination of housing for a five-year period. In other areas, when similar situations have developed, the Government have suggested that it would be in the best interests of economy and the saving of manpower to transfer services, not just from a body such as the commission, but, for example, from the DHSS to the Department responsible for housing. That would be economic, save jobs and would help to streamline the operation of housing benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, and I believe that the Minister and other hon. Members will accept, that that has not worked that way. But if the Committee were to accept the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge, it would help to streamline a transfer of housing nominations from the commission to local authorities. That is sensible. The five-year period in the Bill is unjustified and after it has expired services will be transferred as our amendment suggests. So why have a five-year period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it comes back to an argument that has been put in the past, of which there are examples in legislation. The reason the Minister is pressing for the five-year period is that the Government do not wish services such as the nomination for housing to be handed over to a democratically-elected local body. I am sure that the Minister will reply to that comment. If the Government feel that local government is to have some involvement with the administration of local affairs, they will steer away from that. They do not want to hand over matters to democratically-elected local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some justification for that suspicion in the inclusion of paragraphs (b) and (c) of new subsection (7B). Perhaps they are in the Bill because the Government do not believe in democratically-elected bodies, particularly Labour-controlled councils. I am sure that Labour councillors must haunt the Prime Minister, her Ministers and even some other Tories. All the Government want is to demolish the local authority system, especially when the authority is Labour controlled. That may be the reason the five-year period is included in the Bill. It gives the Tories more time to bring in another system to ensure that local authorities do not get powers to make housing nominations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We referred earlier to the Secretary of State's power to decide what is an accountable public authority. If the amendment were accepted, we should be allowing an elected accountable public authority to make housing nominations. We believe that that is right and proper. We ask that local authorities' responsibilities and powers, such as in housing, which has been the responsibility of local authorities for a considerable time, will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what I said on Tuesday—local authorities have a great deal of experience in providing houses for the rented sector and I am sure that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
they could continue to do so in the new town. areas. I hope that the amendment will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said earlier, the Minister and the Government appear to be looking to the larger corporations rather than to local authorities to take over houses, shops or commercial undertakings. I hope that that is not the Government's intention and that that is not the purpose of the two new paragraphs in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us that the five-year period will help to create job opportunities in those areas because the commission will be able to work with developers and offer them accommodation for key workers. That is a very weak argument for the retaining of the provision. The Minister is on shifting ground. I hope that Conservative Members will recognise that and that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Stevenage): I want to comment briefly on a few of the points made in this short debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) represent sadly wishful thinking about the provision made by—certainly some—local authorities in new towns for nominations for key workers. I should like to see new towns provide more scope for key workers. In changing the responsibilities in the Bill and in previous legislation, it is entirely reasonable to allow for a period of transition where previous commitments have been entered into by development corporations or the Commission for the New Towns allowing new people to move their factories and offices into new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the general remarks that have been made about the Conservative party view of local authorities are complete nonsense. The whole objective of the Bill—and other actions of the Conservative Government—has been to transfer responsibility to local democratic bodies. That transfer must take place in a properly controlled manner, and the Bill seeks to provide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the argument that five years is too long. I was involved a few years ago in negotiations with a development corporation and a district council where agreement was reached on a three-year period, which seemed perfectly appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my hon. Friend the Minister referred to the precedent set by a previous Labour Government for a five-year period and I think that argument sufficiently persuasive for us to retain that term, so that we do not have arbitrary figures of three years in some legislation and five years in other legislation. If agreements can be reached at local levels for shorter periods, so much the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, I listened very closely to the Minister. He did not make a case because the whole substance of his argument was the word " agreement ". Perhaps he will tell us what the commission will use to attract employment when all the assets have been sold under the Bill. His right hon. and hon. Friends are urging him to do a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
waltz—but quick, quick, quick, without the slow. If that is the case, there is no necessity for the five-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are willing to attract industry to their areas. If the Minister can give me the industry, I shall provide all the houses he wants in my constituency. If jobs are created, we shall put people in palaces. I do not know of any local authority worth its salt that has no scheme to look after key employees—especially when that will generate jobs. I ask him openly—if he knows where the jobs are, send them to my area. The employees will not need to look for houses—the local authority will carry them there, cosset them and wrap them up in cotton wool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday the Government lopped off £300 million from regional aid. It comes ill from them to say that the five years nominating right will be a significant factor in attracting jobs to areas where they are vitally needed. If they had added £300 million to regional aid yesterday, they might have had a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the Minister's arguments, and I am considering pressing the amendment to a division. Any local authority worth its salt would have a scheme to look after key employees. I should like some Conservative Member to stand up and tell me of any local authorities that do not provide adequate housing for key workers to attract jobs to that area. I have had extensive experience of local government, and I have yet to hear of one authority —certainly of any Labour authority—that does not have a scheme to allocate houses for key workers wherever industry is, whether the industry is starting up or expanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A thought has just struck me. The five-year period is quite unnecessary, unless the Minister is saying that the problem of the 4 million or 3 million unemployed—depending whose figures we use—will be solved in five years. Is that the significance of the five-year period? If so, he is a brave man. Nevertheless, no case for the five-year period has been made, and so we shall have to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sean Hughes	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I became a Whip two weeks ago I was assured that, in Opposition, the post did not entail taking a Trappist vow. So it is not for that reason, but because I want to follow the example of my hon. Friends the Members for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), who have been concise, relevant and utterly persuasive, that I shall limit my remarks and be brief.
Clause 3 makes optional certain requirements for housing transfer schemes under part 3 of the New Towns Act 1981. At present the requirements are mandatory. Effectively, the 1981 Act requires the Secretary of State to be provided with basic facts about staff, both manual and non-manual, who are affected by transfer schemes. That provision was built into the original Act at the request of the trade unions and after consultation which was apparently believed in then, with local authorities and the new towns associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the provision was to ensure that the Secretary of State was convinced that he could form a broad assessment about whether the staffing establishments of the new housing departments had been drawn up to enable the district councils to pursue sound management policies. The provision was also designed to enable the Secretary of State to satisfy himself that the staffing protection arrangements agreed by the staff commission were being correctly followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alteration now proposed means that the Secretary of State will no longer have to be provided with those basic staffing facts and, therefore, no longer will he have to satisfy himself of the adequacy of staffing arrangements for the future management of the housing assets. The buck will be passed to the local joint consultative committees and the staff commissions. Effectively, the Secretary of State will not be accountable to Parliament for staffing arrangements. Whereas in the past trade unions were able to make representations to the Secretary of State on any inadequacy in the proposed staffing structure of a revised housing establishment, in future he will be able to deny any such responsibility.

The general theme of the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Tyne Bridge and for Normanton has been the lack of consultation and accountability, and that theme is borne out here yet again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee for me to reply now. The clause is important because it simplifies the requirements for housing transfer schemes under part III of the 1981 Act. It makes provisions for nomination rights in such schemes, and the information on staffing arrangements to which the hon. Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. Hughes) has just referred. It makes those arrangements optional rather than mandatory. The clause permits transfer schemes to take effect on the first day of any quarter rather than on only the first day of the financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change in respect of nomination rights recognises that in present circumstances it may not be appropriate for the new town corporation to continue to have nomination rights in housing in the new towns. But equally, there may be circumstances in which that remains appropriate. The clause retains the framework within which such nomination rights can be agreed with the district council.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 5, line 29, leave out from beginning to " or " in line 30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 9, in page 5, line 32, leave out " before that date ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 8 is a probing amendment, and amendment No. 9 a drafting amendment. The Opposition are concerned about the significance of the date, 1 April 1981, in new section 51A(1)(a), which reads:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"which were or was transferred to the council before 1st April 1981 under a 1976 Act tranfer scheme".</p></q>
What happens to any property transferred after 1 April 1981? Such property may have defects to be made good. I do not know how much property is involved, but I know that some local authorities are worried about the date. Some properties are still vested in new towns and will inevitably be transferred under the Bill, but considerably after 1 April 1981. We find that very worrying. The Government have accepted that this would incur a substantial payment by local authorities and have made grants to correct the defects, and that is good.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
But why stop there? Why exclude something purely and simply on the basis of a certain date? By removing the date, we think that the Government would be given the freedom to make grants. If the provision is right on 1 April 1981, so surely it is right on 2 April 1982. The case is the same and that is the point of substance that is raised by the amendment. Surely the same case applies if, by pure chance, the transfer is not made until after that date. That raises all sorts of anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, one local authority could, for various reasons, have its property transferred before 1 April. The next authority, perhaps two or three miles up the road, may, for one of several reasons, have its property transferred on 2 April 1981. The properties may have been built by the same builder and have the same defects, yet one local authority would receive a grant and the other would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say that he will further consider amendment No. 8. I accept that it may be defective as it stands. I do not presume to be a parliamentary draftsman. But if the case is made, the Minister should consider the amendment. Perhaps he could add a provision to the effect that any local authority whose property is transferred after 1 April can at least put its case to the Government. If its case is accepted, a grant could then be paid. That would go a long way to allay the many genuine fears of local authorities that they will be penalised by the legislation and will not receive grants purely because of a date on a calendar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen carefully to what the Minster has to say, but I plead with him to consider the amendment carefully and sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) has explained that this is a probing amendment. The system of finance to which the hon. Gentleman's amendment is directed is rather coplicated and I shall try to take the Committee through the recent history, which I hope will explain why the Government have framed the provision in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the substantial change that there has been made in the system of local authority and new town housing finance by the Housing Act 1980 and the consequent change in the terms on which new town housing transfer schemes are now to be made. The old system of housing finance was based in principle on the idea of an Exchequer contribution to the loan charges resulting from new capital expenditure on the provision of housing. This meant that there was a relatively fixed Exchequer contribution regardless of the actual pressures on the housing revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new towns were cushioned to some extent by the special new towns grant under the powers contained in section 58(2) of the New Towns Act 1981. However, on housing transfer, the special grants ceased subject only to the transitional provisions of the grant under section 51. The new system takes the housing revenue account in the round. Support is based on an assessment of what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
it is reasonable to raise from local resources and what it is reasonable for the authority to spend. In particular, capitalised repairs are eligible for subsidy support. That is the type of expenditure that covers the making good of defects to which the clause refers. That is in contrast to the previous system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of the new approach to the finances of new town housing transfer is that local authority should take over all the resources that the new town corporation would have had at its disposal for manging the same housing. The former special new towns grant has been subsumed into housing subsidies. Therefore, the local authority gets the full benefit of that. Likewise, the local authority is able to obtain subsidy support on capitalised repairs in exactly the same way as the new town corporation would have done. Those changes mean that there is no reason for special support for remedying defects in transferred new town housing for future housing transfers. The local authority will receive support for its expenditure on making good any defects that there may be in exactly the same way as the new town corporations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have noted carefully what the Minister said about the 1983 Act and how it applies to housing defects. He referred to local authority housing in addition to new town housing. Could he say more about subsidies for defects, as against capitalisation of repairs that local authorities have to undertake now out of the HIP allocation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assistance of housing authorities in attending to housing defects is causing great concern to the authorities. The Minister referred to grants, and I am sure that Committee members were interested in what he said. I am sure that local authorities that are responsible for looking after tenants' interests in attending to housing defects would be interested if the Minister gave more information on how defects could be attended to out of grants instead of out of the HIP allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that, after the five-year period has terminated, more houses in the new town areas will be taken into the housing stock of the district council. The Minister should give us some more information about what would happen then in relation to the HIP allocation and grants. Would those who bought houses in the private sector from the commission after 1 April 1981 qualify for grants for defects?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing has always been a problem. Housing defects did not cease on 2 April 1981, even for the commission and for those who bought houses in the new towns. We are concerned about what will happen in those areas if the amendment is rejected and the Bill is accepted in its present form. New section 51A(1)(a) refers to remedial work done by a district council on dwellings or land
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"which were or was transferred to the council before 1st April 1981 under a 1976 Act ".</p></q>
If that provision remains, there will be problems.

My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) questioned whether there should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
a magical date at all. It is confusing and leaves hon. Members in doubt about what is in the Government's mind. The Minister referred to the 1983 Act and the subsidies available for attending to defects and the capitalisation of repairs. That does not justify or explain the problem in detail, and perhaps the Minister will consider it in greater depth. If the Minister accepted the amendment, it would ease our concern and the concern of those who have to administer housing. The Minister would be doing justice to the Committee and the Bill if he approved the amendment and supported my hon. Friend's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Norwood): I have been asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Dormand), who is not a member of the Committee, to put a question to the Minister on the Housing Defects Act 1984. If a person buys from a new town corporation a house which has defects, because it is an Airey house, a Smith house or whatever it may be, does he have a claim under the Housing Defects Act to have the house purchased or repaired by the local authority? I think that the answer is that he would have that right, but I ask only because some doubt has arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Housing Defects Act the public authorities, which comprise new towns, include the Commission for the New Towns and corporations established under, I think, the 1981 Act, although of course the original new town corporations were estblished under much earlier legislation. I could not immediately trace the legislative route which would give the affirmative answer that someone in the position which I have described would have the right to serve his notice directly on the local authority. If that right does not exist, it would be necessary to amend this legislation, but perhaps the Minister, either on this set of amendments or on clause stand part, could give me the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond first to the point raised by the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser)? As he knows, the Housing Defects Act 1984 seeks to offer assistance by way either of reinstatement grant or of re-purchase for those who have bought houses or flats from the public sector which have been found to be defective. It was certainly the Government's intention that all public sector housing should be included, including, for example, housing owned by the British Steel Corporation or the National Coal Board. The hon. Member will remember the debates that we had on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the Housing Defects Act 1984 before me, but I hope that I have good news. I believe it to be the case that the new towns have not owned the prefabricated, reinforced-concrete type of house, which the hon. Member will remember were designed before 1960. If there are any, there are only very few. But as those houses were developed in the public sector, the Government contend that anyone who has now bought one in circumstances where he would otherwise qualify should benefit under the Act. If anything that I have said is not 100 per cent. accurate, I undertake to let the hon. Gentleman know.

I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). The Government have accepted the case for doing something in respect of past housing transfers. The authorities concerned were assured by the previous Labour Government that, with certain exceptions, claims for grants under section 51 of the New Towns Act 1981 would be considered. Those are claims for help with remedying defects. The present Government have undertaken to fulfil that assurance. But grant under section 51 of the 1981 Act is limited to circumstances where the local authority is suffering a financial burden as a result of transfer. In the course of assessing the claims for grant, it became apparent that on the new financial basis for local authority housing the district councils concerned were not suffering a financial burden. If they increased their rents to what the Government regarded as reasonable levels, and with the benefit of the disposals under the right to buy, the district councils concerned were reasonably provided with resources for the necessary repairs to the remaining stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, in view of the assurances given both by this Government and by their predecessor, Ministers decided to make grant available in respect of past housing transfers on the same basis as they would have done had there been no resriction under section 51 requiring the local authority to show financial burden before it could be eligible. These payments were made under the Appropriation Act, and clause 4 simply provides for specific parliamentary authority for what had been done under the Appropriation Act. There is no case for extending the power to pay grants to any cases other than the limited category for which the clause makes provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton asked about housing authorities and their own priorities for capital expediture. As the Committee will remember, it is up to each local authority to decide what priority it should give to the spending of the allocations made to it under the housing investment programme. When a local authority spends capital on making good defects. a proportion of the consequent loan charges—in general 75 per cent.—is eligible for subsidy within the rules of housing subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>REVOCATION OF CERTAIN STAFF COMPENSATION REGULATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 6, line 24, at end insert
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"except where negotiations with staff had commenced prior to that date".</p></q>
Amendment No. 14, which has not been moved, seeks to do exactly the same as amendment No. 10, but in a different manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 also contains dates for which we should like to know the justification. It is a similar case to the one that we argued on the previous amendment. Again we are talking about people. We are dealing with staff compensation regulations which come into effect before the Bill is enacted and becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, irrespective of whether we like it or believe it, life is going on in the world outside. At this moment employers may be negotiating with their staff. Yet the Bill prevents sensible negotiation taking place and brings in retrospective legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about new towns and local authorities now negotiating with staff? I hope that they have obtained a copy of the Bill. I remind the Committee that the measure is still only a Bill. On reading the Bill they can make one of two assumptions: first, that the Bill will be passed as it is or, secondly, that an amendment may be made in Committee. However, we have not had a great deal of luck up to now. Nevertheless, those at present negotiating are in a dilemma. People whose jobs may be at risk, who may have to transfer or who may be made redundant are in a difficult situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before a negotiator can start he finds either that his hands are tied or that he does not know exactly what the position will be. It is a little naughty to introduce retrospective legislation such as this. It shows a certain arrogance towards the Committee to assume that the Bill will automatically be enacted as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, those who are the subject of the negotiations face an anomoly. Are they part of a total negotiation? Those who negotiate frequently know that it is necessary sometimes to negotiate in phases. Certain grades of staff may be settled first although they all belong to the same association. For example, those who get settled on 6 November will have the benefits that the Bill removes. Yet, by pure chance that they can do nothing about, others in the same negotiations who get settled on 7 November will be under a completely different set of rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any reasonable person worth his salt should say that where negotiations have commenced and where people are reaching an agreement, the conditions in the Bill should not operate until the negotiations are complete. If one intends to impose new conditions, one must tell the parties the rules before they begin to negotiate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
The Bill does the opposite. It is not fair to the staff concerned. Again, the Government have shown a certain arrogance to the Committee by including this measure. It is as though they were riding rough shod over the Opposition Benches, saying, " It doesn't matter about them. This Bill will go through ". Such arrogance should not have been included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Minister. Please remember that we are dealing with people. Please give them a certain amount of fairness. Accept the amendment in good faith and say that where negotiations have commenced, the retrospective legislation will not apply and that people involved in the same negotiations will enjoy the same conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that there is a need for comment on this section of the Bill and for support for the amendment. No one can say that the Government are a progressive employer and that they have the interest of their employers at heart. The Bill provides that the conditions of employment and the compensation regulations will cease to have effect on 7 November. That is totally unfair and wrong in the opinion of free-thinking people because staff will be in the employ of the Commission for some time after that date. Who knows what the position will be after that date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is turmoil in the mining industry because consideration has not been given to past practices and long-standing agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Michael Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Darlington): Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, " Nonsense ", but that is the position. I am sure that his experience in the mining industry supersedes mine, so he must know what colour coal is. But I am telling him the reason for the turmoil. He has exactly the same attitude as the Government and their other supporters towards those in employment. That is shown in the arbitrary date of 7 November. That is the nonsense that we should refer to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members know that there has been total disregard of conditions and agreements in the mining industry. That leads to confrontation and is no way to operate industrial relations. That is what the amendment is about. We are entering the area of industrial relations. Conservative Members should be aware that the staff employed by the commission have a right to put their case and be heard before we write cut-off dates into legislation. They can then negotiate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to my hon. Friend the Members for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans), the Minister said:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"that indeed is the case—that the new town development corporation should be wound up as soon as possible with adventage to those living in the new towns."</p></q> [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 27 November 1984; c. 6-8.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people employed by the commission live in the area. They helped to build the new towns. The Government intend to treat them in a shameful way. The principle that there should be advantage to those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
living in the new towns should be extended to those employed in the new towns who will be affected by the legislation, especially as they have devoted their time to making the new towns work. It is poor reward to them to cut off any compensation due to them by inserting the date of 7 November in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the time involved in winding up the commission, we suggest the date of 1 January 1986 instead. That would also give time for staff trade unions to make representations. That is a reasonable request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman place his comments in context? Does he agree that everyone involved has had two and a half years' notice of this event and that his plea for an extension of time would further extend the two and a half years since notice was given by the Government of the change in the basis of these negotiations? It has not happened, as he seems to imply, overnight. We have all seen it coining for a very long time. Is that the context in which he makes his comments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am saying that there is flexibility in the Bill to which Conservative Members have agreed. The Government have also been aware for two and a half years that this change was taking place. If there is flexibility in the Bill for certain aspects of the rundown of the commission, in all fairness and justice, that flexibility should also apply to those employed in the new towns. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that there has been sufficient time and that perhaps the whole matter can be tidied up and tucked away in the next six or nine months, so why not make the date 1 January 1986 or some other suitable date? Let us apply the flexibility not only to some of the areas about which the Secretary of State may be concerned, but to some of those whose livelihood may depend on it when the commission is wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are concerned about the staff employed by the commission, I appeal to them to accept the amendment. Without doubt, it would introduce an element of industrial relations in the Bill. The Government are not at all clear about industrial relations. The cut-off date of 7 November will not help to settle the problems of those who may lose their jobs when the commission is wound up. Against that backcloth, we suggest that the date of 1 January 1986 should be accepted in preference to 7 November 1984. I appeal to the Minister and to Conservative Members to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sean Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Knowsley, South): I should like to say a few words in support of the comments made by my hon. Friends. Effectively, the clause removes the protection of the Crombie code on terms of redundancy and compensation for staff affected by transfer of housing schemes. I realise that notice of withdrawal was given some time ago, and that the public sector unions have raised objections; unfortunately, they have raised them to no avail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unfairness created by withdrawal in mid-programme means that some staff in the first and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
second rounds of housing transfers have received Crombie code protection, while others will receive lesser terms of protection and compensation. In the past, staff have received assurances that if statutory reorganisations take place and legislation is required they will receive protection under the code. Those assurances are apparently to be negated. If the Crombie code protection is withdrawn, we are left with a number of serious gaps in the present arrangements, including the compensation to be paid to staff who suffer loss or decrease in income as a result of the transfer. I therefore urge Conservative Members to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will remember that I dealt with the provisions of clause 5 on Second Reading. Of course I understand the case advanced by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and for Knowsley, South (Mr. Hughes). However, I feel that the charge of retrospection is massively diminished, and some of my hon. Friends may think that it is eliminated—my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) mentioned this in his intervention when we look at what actually happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 28th April 1982 my right hon. Friend, now the Secretary of State for Defence, wrote to the chairman of the New Towns Whitley Council:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"As you no doubt know, the Government have decided what steps should be taken to withdraw the Crombie code compensation terms in relation to future statutory re-organisation in the public service. This decision was reached because Crombie . . . was introduced at a time when redundancy benefits were far less widespead than at present and long before the introduction of the countrywide scheme of statutory redundancy payments. It is now anomalous and unfair to have a separate code of compensation solely for redundancies resulting from statutory reorganisations."</p></q>
My hon. Friend went on:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"I have now decided that Crombie terms should be withdrawn from staff affected by future housing transfers."</p></q>
Those words were not dreamed up by the Minister for Housing and Construction for the purposes of our present debate. They are on the record. I shall be happy to send a copy of the letter to the hon. Member for Normanton, to his hon. Friends and possibly even to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), the official spokesman of the Liberal party. The clause fulfils in every respect the undertakings given by my right hon. Friend. There have been no housing transfers since that letter was written. My right hon. Friend said that Crombie would be withdrawn in respect of all future housing transfers, and that is precisely what the Bill does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton asked why we had selected 7 November as the date. That was the date on which the House gave the Bill its First Reading. We shall fulfil in every respect my right hon. Friend's undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcester-; shire was quite right to remind the Committee that those who might otherwise have been entitled to the Crombie terms have known since April 1982 that the terms would not apply to any future housing transfers. That being so, I invite the Committee
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
to give specific legislative approval to the long warning given by my right hon. Friend who is now Secretary of State for Defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further important principle underlies what is happening. In any industrial relations context, it is unreasonable to expect that an arrangement can go on for ever, that it can be set in concrete and expected to continue in perpetuity. We live in changing times and a changing environment. In the context of the Bill, we are talking about change, about progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another. In that context, it is quite unreasonable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what is being done —an arrangement is being set in concrete. The Government are saying, " That is it ". As my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge said, it would be reasonable to allow such flexibility to 1 January 1986. That does not mean in perpetuity. That specific date would provide better flexibility for the arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the hon. Gentleman and I are examining the same set of circumstances from completely different perspectives. That is not an unusual phenomenon in the House. I suspect that we shall not agree on the matter. My point is precisely opposite to the hon. Gentleman's. Given the context of a progression in institutional arrangements and that clear notice of such changes was given two and a half years ago—as my hon Friend the Minister reminded us—it is unreasonable and unreal for Opposition Members to argue that a set of arragements which they believe was uniquely favourable to certain people should continue for ever and for the Opposition not to recognise the context in which those arrangements were placed. That is the language of total unreality and inflexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make my comments in the context of what the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said about another matter and dispute: that is precisely the kind of problem that the Government are trying to deal with right across the spectrum of industrial relations. It is regrettable, but it illustrates all too well the difference in attitude between the Opposition and Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to introduce change in a structured and civilised way to face future problems more successfully. That is the essence of the Bill in every respect. Unfortunately, Opposition Members constantly want to keep the same institutions, doing the same work, regardless of the fact that the world continues to turn and that circumstances change. Nothing can illustrate that better than the Bill, the clause and this argument. That is why, yet again, the Government are right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) has just proved to me that he has not even read the amendment. It he needs two or three seconds, perhaps you could adjourn the Committee, Sir Philip, so that the hon. Gentleman may read the amendment and then make another speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The grounds outlined by the hon. Member are a little too flimsy a reason for adjourning the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have to try to educate Conservative Members, Sir Philip. The amendment does not ask for the arrangement to continue for ever—far from it. It refers to " where negotiations . . . had commenced " already. The hon Gentleman is correct—there is a vast difference between both sides of the Committee. That is the only point on which I agree with him. In effect, he is trying to change the rules after the fighters have climbed into the ring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am doing nothing of the kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that the Minister goes into the ring. Perhaps the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire should go into the ring. People have been negotiating and have been dealt with under the Crombie Code. [HON. MEMBERS: " No."] Of course they have. What is meant by the date, 7 November? The fact that a man is advised that he is going to be hanged does not take away the fact that he is going to be hanged. Certain people are being dealt with under the code. The Government are trying to change that. I agree with the Minister on one point only. He is absolutely correct, without a shadow of a doubt, that redundancies have increased under his Government. If the Government keep those policies, we shall be making the same point next year because the number of redundancies will be even greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have been threatened and transferred under that code and negotiations have taken place under it. Now the Government wish to change that for reasons best known to themselves. It can only be to save a bob or two. The difference between our parties is that we care about those people being dealt with under the code while the Government care more about saving a few bob.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not it be wholly wrong to include the amendment in such a way that it would change the basis on which negotiations might have taken place? The amendment would damage negotiations that have been taking place on the basis of the announcement made two and a half years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That cuts no ice. Who would it affect? It seems that negotiations have been carried out under the arrogant assumption that the Committee does not exist and that legislation is passed before it has been discussed by the House. That shows the Government's arrogance. We ask whether it would harm the staff. The staff would welcome the return of the Crombie Code.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point made by my hon. Friend, we are not aware what stage negotiations have reached or what has taken place in those negotiations. Perhaps the hon. Member for Stevenage (Mr. Wood) knows and can enlighten us. If there is justification for keeping to 7 November, perhaps we can consider it. In fact, Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
Members do not know any more than we do about what stage the negotiations have reached. That is why we want extra time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend clarifies the situation. It points to the blatant arrogance of Conservative Members. Let us reflect on what happened. The Tories write a letter. Two and a half years later they come to the place of democracy to make that letter legal. Is not that arrogance? Is not that power? Hon. Members are elected to this place to represent their constituencies. Meanwhile, the Secretary of State is writing letters telling people what to do when he does not have the power under law to do so until the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should get the Attorney-General to come here to say whether such procedure is legally right—whether that letter has the power of law. If it had that power, we would not be sitting here discussing the Bill. An arrogant letter has been imposed on those negotiating by an arrogant Conservative Member who ignores democracy. Time after time, Conservative Members have the sheer audacity to tell Opposition Members what great democrats they are and how they are protecting people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's proceedings are but a by-product. It is as though no one exists. Certainly, the clause will do nothing for the staff involved, even for those staff who paid attention to that arrogant, non-legal, undemocratic, decision-making letter. I submit that acceptance of the amendment would ensure at least that all staff were treated the same and that they came under the Crombie code wherever negotiations have started. We are asking only for fairness, although to give that might seem strange to the Government. Let negotiations continue under the Crombie code. If changes are then required, at least they would be legal because the Bill will have been enacted, and at least before negotiations start the rules will be known. That is what we ask. That is why my hon. Friends will divide the Committee on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to respond briefly to one of the hon. Gentleman's points. Of course my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State did not believe that the letter of 28 April had the force of law. In his letter he specifically said:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"I intend to seek the first suitable legislative opportunity to repeal section 54(4) of the Act of 1981 and thereby remove the regulation-making requirement."</p></q>
My right hon. Friend acknowledged that legislation was required to give effect to what he announced in his letter. We are now taking that first legislative opportunity, of which my right hon. Friend wrote. There is no arrogance. Indeed, I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury)—he will correct me if I am mistaken—was Parliamentary Private Secretary to my right hon. Friend. Therefore, my hon. Friend will know better than any other member of the Committee that to describe my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence as arrogant is wholly wrong. He is the last man to whom the word " arrogant " ought to be applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address myself to the wider provisions of the clause. The Secretary of State proposes to remove not just the existing regulations, but the power to make special staff regulations on transfer. He is not obliged to make regulations in future, but he is removing even the power to make them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said on Second Reading—and it was repeated this morning by the Minister for Housing and Construction that the power to make those regulations was put into statute before the existence of a statutory redundancy scheme, and that it is therefore anomalous to have alongside that statutory redundancy scheme the power to make special regulations for the transfer of staff. That is, I think, a sufficient summary of what was said on Second Reading. However, to say that it is anomalous to have one set of compensation regulations for local government staff alongside the statutory redundancy scheme is to fly in the face of the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read in the paper, either this morning or yesterday, that Peter Jay, who has lost his job at TV-am, will get a redundancy payment of £134,000. Similarly, the Secretary of State for Transport, in his wisdom —we respect his humane judgment on these matters —decided when a number of directors of London Transport were sacked that it was right to pay tax-free redundancy payments, amounting to between £13,000 and £33,000, to former members of the London Transport Executive. Compared with the statutory redundancy scheme, that was an anomaly, but the Secretary of State for Transport thought that it was right to compensate people such as the former hon. Member for Paddington and others for loss of job in those circumstances. If the chairman of the National Coal Board were summarily dismissed from his post, because he is over the age of 65 years, he would not be entitled to any statutory redundancy payment because, as the Minister knows, there is no entitlement to it over the age of 65. However, I am sure that when the Prime Minister gets round to sacking the chairman of the National Coal Board, she will make some arrangement for redundancy pay which would be anomalous, compared with the statutory redundancy scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider private industry. One knows that in much of private industry, where there is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
money in the coffers, redundancy schemes are far in excess of the bare amounts that are now provided under the statutory scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there are anomalies. They happen all the time. In much of private industry—as in much of state industry, dockers and miners, for example—workers get large tax-free redundancy payments. I do not attack the principle. It is right to cushion the effect of putting men and women out of work, with the possibility that they may never work again. So it is right that these schemes should afford the most generous scales that are possible in the circumstances.

I therefore question what the Minister said on Second Reading about more generous redundancy schemes being anomalous compared with the statutory scheme. That has very wide implications, bearing in mind what is about to come to the Floor of the House. The local government legislation talks about 8,000 redundancies taking place. If the Minister is saying that every time there is a reorganisation of a public corporation or local government, we shall rely only on the statutory scheme, that will be a severe blow. Moreover, it will be a blow to people who lose their jobs not as a result of the conditions of industry or commerce, but as a result of decisions taken by the Minister and his colleagues. They are bringing about the loss of jobs by changing the statutory basis for people's employment. I do not see, in principle, how the Minister can say that it is therefore anomalous not to have a more generous scheme than that provided under the Redundancy Payments Act 1965.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had at the start of the speech of the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) some interesting comments on Mr. Peter Jay, who is the son of a former Labour Cabinet Minister and who, I remember, succeeded me at Winchester as president of our debating society. As the hon. Gentleman will recall, Mr. Jay was also appointed by the Labour Government to be our ambassador in Washington. Now others have apparently placed a high value upon the services with which his former employer has decided to dispense. Nevertheless, that was an interesting illustration. The hon. Gentleman went on to comment on the present chairman of the National Coal Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to become diverted, because I might be out of order. But I wish to tell the hon. Gentleman that clause 5 only removes the obligation laid upon my right hon. Friend to make the regulations described therein. I do not wish to be repetitive, but I regard clause 5 as being simply a statutory fulfilment of what was a non-statutory declaration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, does he stand by the words that were used in the letter:

The scheme was introduced long before the introduction of a countrywide scheme of statutory redundancy payments. Is he now revoking the statement in the letter of 1982, and saying that people would still be entitled only to the usual day-to-day terms which, in the context of the letter, appears to mean the terms under the 1965 Act, not the more advantageous terms that might be negotiated by the staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>GRANTS TO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS AND COMMISSION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 8, line 8, at end add—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"(6) No grants shall be made under the terms of this section unless a draft order has been laid before and approved by resolution of the House of Commons."</p></q>
This is the old theme, where divinity is conferred on a Secretary of State and he is allowed to pay grants—I shall revert to our suspicion about the grants—without a chance for hon. Members to take him to task. The only difference about this clause is that there are two divinities. Not only must the Secretary of State make the grant, but he must have the approval of the archdeacon from the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We submit that both cases are absolutely wrong. Grants can be paid and hon. Members will not be aware what the grants are, why they are paid and what the substance of them is. We are asking that that should not happen. An order should come before the House of Commons so that hon. Members have a chance of seeing and discussing what the Secretary of State, and in this case the Treasury, is actually doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a deep suspicion that the reason for the clause is that the policy of selling off assets is not going as well as we are led to believe. Perhaps the time has arrived when most of the goodies have been 'dispensed with. We do not know
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
what benefit that has for the taxpayer, and we suspect that an influx of taxpayers' money is needed to make these assets more attractive and acceptable to those who would buy, or allegedly would buy them, to ensure that the policy works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall Conservative Members arguing the case for open government not so very long ago. When they were in Opposition they were up on their feet almost every second of the day accusing Labour Governments of behind-the-door secrecy and everything that goes with it. Yet, lo and behold, they are not practising what they preach. They are reserving absolute powers for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State, and for that matter the Treasury, has nothing to hide, why should he be afraid of coming before the House of Commons? Ministers seem to think that whatever they do, there must be provisions in Bills to take powers unto themselves. Are they frightened of their own side? Forget about the Opposition for the moment—though not for long. If the order were discussed on the Floor of the House, Conservative Members as well as Opposition Members would be involved. The Government have a massive majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike Conservative Members I live in the real world, and I recognise that fact, which makes my case all the stronger. Why should Ministers be frightened of coming before the House and explaining their actions when they know beforehand that they will get away with them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we marched everybody in, the Secretary of State would be backed by his avalanche of troops, so he is on to a winner before he has even placed a bet. Yet he is frightened of coming before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Housing and Construction said earlier that the provision removed the power of the Treasury, and there was general acclaim for that across the Committee. How does that relate to the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he claims righteously and takes great delight in the fact that the Treasury loses power in one clause, why does he not take away its power in this clause? He will have to share his power. God would not say that he had divine right and then say that he had a partner in that divine right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reasonable for us to be able to ask questions and receive answers. If the amendment were carried, the Minister would have the opportunity on the Floor of the House to assure myself and other hon. Members that these grants would not be used to make the assets more palatable or safe. But if it is not, that suspicion will remain with me and many other hon. Members. There is nothing in the clause that he has to reveal. He can just act, and we need not know anything about it. Once again, it removes power from the House of Commons. We believe that that is fundamentally and morally wrong and should be removed. He should be answerable to the House on all these matters and hon. Members should have an opportunity to question any decision that he makes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that we have not yet concluded even our second sitting, but I have had occasion to remark earlier that one of the characteristics of the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans), who has a secure place in the affections of us all, is that every issue is presented as being of the highest moral importance. When every issue is presented in that way, sometimes the effect of the hon. Gentleman's indignation is diminished. Who am I to offer advice? But I do offer this very friendly and well meant advice to him. I think that some difference of style from time to time, to try to match the rhetoric with the real needs rather than with the imagined needs, would not come amiss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do a bit of unctuous creeping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now levels a charge against me because I said earlier that he was a distinguished member of the previous Labour Administration. I have no wish to ingratiate myself with the hon. Gentleman. I was paying a genuine tribute to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to get diverted. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge should have sought to impose a further barrier against my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who it is true has to act under the clause with the approval of the Treasury—I must not get diverted into the Treasury either at this juncture. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would bring in a further step in making a grant. I thought that the Labour party was passionately committed to handing out Government money, and the clause enables a grant to be made. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that there should be a further parliamentary stage, some of my hon. Friends—am I not surrounded by my hon. Friends, all of whom are as dry as dust and wholly committed to the Government's economic policies, and which of us is not?—might speak,—I am sure that they would not vote—against the proposal to make a grant. Therefore, it seems very strange that the Opposition should be seeking to impose another potential barrier, formidable though my hon. Friends are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All grants made under the clause are out of money provided by Parliament. There therefore has to be an Estimate voted by the House of Commons to give effect to any grants under the clause. To have an order subject to the affirmative resolution would only delay the giving of grants. That is not something which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would like, although I can conceive of circumstances in which such a proposal might be welcome to the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misjudges his hon. Friends when he talks about them upholding the Government's economic policies. When it comes to grants, they want to scrutinise them very carefully. If the amendment is accepted, some of the grants that would be made by the Secretary of State could be voted by the Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that this is already happening among Tory Members over student grants. If I read the situation correctly, the Government may have to change course on their economic policy over
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
the student grant because of the rebellious nature of their Back Benchers. The revolt from them concerns not grants to housing tenants or housing associations but grants to middle-class students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternative policies will be sought by the Government's supporters, and perhaps that is why the Minister is saying that the power to decide what housing grants should be available under the Bill will be given to the Secretary of State, he acting with the Treasury's approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Government are afraid that the process of parliamentary accountability would reveal that they were not being fair to housing associations. All we ask is that if decisions are to be taken on grants enabling the commission to meet housing expenditure, Parliament should be involved. That is why the amendment states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"No grants shall be made under the terms of this section unless a draft order has been laid before and approved by resolution of the House of Commons."</p></q>
It is based on the principle of parliamentary accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sean Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used an interesting word, which may clarify the difference between us. What my hon. Friend sees as a measure of accountability, the Minister sees as a barrier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a point. The involvement of the House in decisions made under the Bill could be interpreted as a barrier to the Secretary of State; not because of the Opposition's possible reactions but because of those Conservative Back Benchers. The Secretary of State seems to have reservations about the support that he could obtain from his hon. Friends. We have witnessed revolt on a number of matters recently, and perhaps the Government and the Prime Minister fear that it will increase and develop. Perhaps that is why the power to make grants to the commission is to be invested in the Secretary of State
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"as may approved by the Treasury."</p></q>
Perhaps the Secretary of State could not obtain total power in the matter. Perhaps that is why Treasury approval has been included. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is tightening his grip. He is saying to the Secretary of State for the Environment, " Before you write anything in your legislation, let me remind you that I want to be in on the act. I must have some say on what you do with the finances." The almighty is surfacing again; the Chancellor will decide. The power of the Secretary of State and his Department is being undermined by a requirement for approval by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to Conservative Members that we should not allow the Treasury to become involved with the business of the Department of the Environment. If any decision is to be taken it should be taken by Parliament, not by the Treasury after the Secretary of State's approach. That approach should be to the full House and approval should be by resolution of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister paid tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) by saying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
that every issue he raises in Committee is of high moral fibre. That is what we expect from Opposition Members who table amendments to Government legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the amendments is that we believe that they are important to the Bill and to the people whose destinies will be influenced by the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend will continue to bring his views and amendments to the Committee with that high moral fibre and the principles with which we are so familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to consider carefully the points that have been made. I know that the Minister must take note of the Secretary of State's views and that the Bill has his approval. I hope that the Secretary of State will soon be back in the House of Commons. It was remiss of the Committee not to record the fact that we all regret the accident that took place. We wish to record the fact that we hope to see him fully recovered to good health as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). I commiserate with him on the fact that the political adviser to the Minister for Local Government gave up his seat at Lambeth last week with the result that the seat was lost to the Liberal party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall take that in the context in which it was given. I am sure that those who made the decision not to elect another Conservative acted in good faith, just as I am acting in good faith in hoping that the Secretary of State makes a speedy recovery to good health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister will have to take note of what the Secretary of State said when he observed that before grants of the commission can be approved they must have the approval of the Secretary of State and perhaps also of the Treasury. If the Government are sincere in trying to develop more accountability of Parliament, and greater involvement of Parliament in decision making, the amendment should be accepted. I ask the Minister carefully to consider the amendment and to recommend to his colleagues that it be accepted. It would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
the first Opposition amendment to be accepted in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be concerned if any delays were created by procedure which would in turn, mean delays in the demise of the new towns commission. I am anxious to speed the ending of that quango. I believe that my constituents, who are involved directly because they live with the commission and, as taxpayers, have to contribute towards it, share my anxiety. We do not want further delays. Let us see quickly the end of that quango, and move with great speed. I therefore conclude my remarks so as not to delay the matter any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy) for his most excellent speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment, for the reasons I explained. However, I thank the hon. Members for Tyne Bridge and for Normanton for what they said about my right hon. Friend. I shall report their kind messages to him when I speak to him later today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
