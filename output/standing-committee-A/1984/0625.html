<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands <span class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have noticed that the Opposition have not tabled amendments to clause 4. That was a conscious decision, although I have been tempted to table amendments in the light of remarks made about subsection (1). However, it seems that the best way to proceed is through a searching stand part debate.<br><br>
We have not had detailed notes on clauses so members of the Committee must examine the structure of the clause and determine how it relates to other provisions in the Bill. I was tempted to table amendments to the first line of the clause, especially after hearing the remarks of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). Clause 4(1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Agency to dispose of or discharge, on the best terms reasonably obtainable, all of the property, rights and liabilities".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman drew the Committee's attention to that when we were debating the transfer of
<br><blockquote><p>"all the property, rights and liabilities"</p></blockquote>
in clause 3. My hon. Friends and I argued that existing contracts involved BNOC's purchase of commercial and some participation oil, not bound by any time but by the life of the field; and that such contracts may be still in place at the transfer of the rights, liabilities and property to the agency. We argued that that was not necessarily a bad thing. I said that there should be no undue pressure placed on oil companies who had such contractual relationships with BNOC to unwind them or to give up advantageous arrangements for the trading and purchase of their oil.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North intervened as I was pressing the Minister to give an assurance that there would be no undue behind-the-scenes ministerial pressure put on oil companies. The hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"there is no obligation or pressure on the Minister. Is not the pressure from the legislation itself? Clause 4(1) says:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Agency to dispose"— </p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>not the duty of the Minister. Parliament is resolving this and so it is not necessary for pressure to be brought by the Minister in this connection".—[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 20 June 1985; c. 321.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman that contracts might be unravelled because clause 4 provides that it shall be the duty of the agency to unravel contracts or to disperse BNOC's contractual obligations and rights particularly towards smaller oil companies to manage and to trade their oil.<br><br>
If clause 4 is passed, I want to ensure that no pressure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
—legislative, parliamentary or otherwise—will be placed on companies to give up their contractual rights in the purchase and trading of their oil with BNOC. The contracts were negotiated openly and freely and BNOC was given no statutory rights enabling it to purchase all the oil of those companies on a commercial basis or the whole of their participation oil for the life of the field without serving six or 12-month election notices.<br><br>
The contracts were genuinely negotiated arrangements between BNOC and many smaller companies, and they suited both BNOC and the companies. There should be no compulsion—parliamentary, legislative or otherwise—or pressure on those contractual arrangements if the companies concerned do not want to unravel or terminate them. The Minister said that they would all have to be negotiated, and that clause 4 does not override people's rights. I am sure that he will confirm today that clause 4(1) does not override the rights of companies that have contractual relationships with BNOC.<br><br>
Obviously, the agency will be able to see how far it can unravel the existing contracts that it inherits, but that is as far as it can go in negotiating the conclusion of those contracts. There should be no message from the Committee that clause 4(1) provides any legislative pressure for the contracts to be unscrambled.<br><br>
It is worth repeating the case that we made on Thursday, and I hope that the Minister will assure us that there will be no attempt to browbeat or twist the arms of any smaller companies. If companies want to maintain those relationships, they should sit tight. That should be our recommendation. There is no reason why they should be forced to race off into the clutches of bigger oil companies or try to sell their oil in any other way. I hope that the Minister will confirm that they can sit tight and hold on to what they have, if it suits them, and that there is no reason why they should unscramble arrangements that were freely and genuinely entered into by BNOC, for mutual interest, because the Government have changed their mind and have decided to abolish BNOC and create this new agency.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will confirm that clause 4(1) does nothing more than tell the agency to go ahead if it is possible, but that unravelling those contracts will not be a test of the agency's virility.<br><br>
Secondly, I draw the Committee's attention to the structure of subsection (1) which states that the agency will
<br><blockquote><p>"dispose of or discharge … the property, rights and liabilities vested in it by virtue of section 3"—</p></blockquote>
—that is the transfer from BNOC—
<br><blockquote><p>"except such as may be determined by the Secretary of State to be property, rights and liabilities which, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection (2) below, should continue to be vested in the Agency".</p></blockquote>
A common theme of the Minister's speeches throughout our debates has been that the agency should be allowed to get on with the practical issues. Why should Ministers and the Secretary of State be involved in staffing, preparing and organising the agency's accounts, and so on? The basic thrust of the Minister's argument has been that, once the agency is set up, it should get on with the job of establishing itself and arranging its affairs and business in the most efficient manner possible. Yet under subsection (2), the agency cannot tell the Minister what it needs to fulfil its functions; the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
Secretary of State is to determine what assets the agency shall have to operate the powers and provisions in clause 2.<br><br>
Why should not the agency itself say which assets, properties, rights and contracts it wants as the basis of an operation to fulfil the obligations placed upon it under clause 2? Subsection (1) provides that the Secretary of State will determine which property, rights and so on the agency will retain and which it will dispose of to fulfil its functions under clause 2. Surely the best body to decide that will be the agency. Time and again, the Minister's theme has been that the agency and not Minister will know how best to deal with those practical issues. Why should not the agency decide what it must retain and dispose of to fulfil its functions under clause 2.<br><br>
How will Parliament know what the Secretary of State has decided to leave with the agency and what it must dispose of? There is no such provision in the Bill. How will those of us who have been involved in the detailed discussion of the Bill and the House as a whole learn what the Secretary of State has decided to leave the agency to hold and what is unnecessary for the discharge of its duties under clause 2? The assets may be considerable. In what parliamentary form will we know how they will be divested or retained by the agency?<br><br>
Our consistent view has been that the agency should not be as minimalist as the Minister argues. On the contrary, there is scope for flexibility to allow it to trade successfully in managing the royalty oil under clause 2(1)(d) and to exercise other roles. Clause 2(1)(d) says that the agency shall have power
<br><blockquote><p>"to buy, sell or otherwise deal in petroleum on its own account".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) says that the agency shall retain certain assets on the Secretary of State's direction so that it can fulfil its functions under the motor clause of the Bill—clause 2.<br><br>
We debated clause 2(1)(d) at some length. We believe that there is scope for the agency to buy, sell or otherwise deal in petrol on its own account. What functions in addition to the management of royalty oil will the agency have? What properties, rights and so on will it retain to fulfil its functions under clause 2(1)(d), which clause 4(2) says will determine which assets and rights the agency inherits from BNOC?<br><br>
There is no case for excessive divesting of assets inherited by the agency from BNOC. That could lead to the stifling and minimising of the agency's functions under clause 2. The Minister steered that clause through unscathed despite attempts by Conservative Members to remove some aspects of it. We supported him and argued for the more expansionary role laid down in clause 2.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North was right to say that clause 2 provided a fair degree of scope for the agency to fulfil its functions. It is important that the properties and rights retained by the agency under clause 4(1) and (2) are adequate to enable it to fulfil its functions under clause 2(1)(a) and (d).<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I should be interested to know the Minister's thinking about the balance of retention and disposal of assets. When debating clause 3, we illustrated the type of rights or contractual obligations that the agency will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
inherit. There will be a number of contractual obligations in respect of certain issues, for example, in the Piper and Claymore fields. The small Claymore group of interests has contractual obligations to BNOC for 7,500 to 10,000 barrels a day, which are locked in for the life of the field. If those obligations were combined with the substantial royalty-in-kind oil produced by that field—about 30,000 barrels a day—there could be a useful function for the agency in managing that royalty oil. Ministers explained that that was the purpose of clause 2(1)(d).<br><br>
If those contractual rights have not been disposed of before the transfer date, I hope that, under clause 4, the Secretary of State will decide to retain rather than dispose of them, to give support to the agency in fulfilling its functions under clause 2. I hope that those field supplies will be classic examples of how flexibility and pragmatism can help the agency to work, and that that will be the keynote of the Secretary of State's approach in deciding what the agency should retain and what it should dispose of.<br><br>
This is the first opportunity that we have had to discuss the capital structure of the new agency. Clause 4(2)(b) contains the other reason for retaining rather than disposing of assets, which is to create the initial capital base of the agency. No information about that was given to us on Second Reading. There was a disgraceful non-contribution from the Minister of State and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary who wound up the debate. Therefore, clause 4(2)(b) should be of considerable interest to all Committee members if they have done their homework and are paying attention to the Bill.<br><br>
We will deal with borrowing powers when we debate clause 5, but clause 4(2)(b) appears to mean—no doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—that the financial structure of the agency will be based on the assets that are transferred from BNOC to the new agency. When that transfer takes place, some assets will be disposed of and the remainder will form the capital base of the new agency. That is how I read clause 4(2)(b). However, I hope that the Minister will enlighten us.<br><br>
We need to find out what the assets will be and what capital reserves or initial capital the agency will need. The BNOC assets to be transferred include fixed assets of £1.1 million. That is shown on page 10 of the BNOC 1984 annual report. The fixed assets are listed on page 19, and include leasehold improvements. I am not sure what that means, so perhaps the Minister will explain it to me. The figure for leasehold improvements is £495,000. Does that represent just leases on office blocks? The word "improvements" throws me.<br><br>
Then there are sums for office furniture, office equipment and computers, and motor vehicles. Motor vehicles are shown as £200,000, although there is a depreciation figure for them in the column below. The total figure for fixed assets is £1,090,000.<br><br>
Are those figures still in place? The accounts cover the first three months of this year. Is that the amount of fixed assets that will be transferred under clause 3 and therefore available either to be retained or disposed of under clause 4, fulfilling the functions of clause 4(2)(a) and providing the initial capital under clause 4(2)(b)?<br><br>
We know that whatever fixed assets are retained by BNOC will be transferred and then either disposed of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0236">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
or retained under clause 4. Can we be told more about BNOC's fixed assets and what will be transferred?<br><br>
At our previous sitting, we had a long and sometimes confusing discussion about BNOC's existing capital reserve. We concluded that it was £18.3 million at March, compared with £30 million at 28 February. But those figures are for only the first quarter. Under clause 3, the assets, properties, rights and capital are being transferred from the corporation to the agency, and then being disposed of under clause 4. Can the Minister tell us about the present position? Does BNOC still have a capital reserve of £18.3 million? What provision has been made for redundancies? Where will that money come from?<br><br>
In other words, if the transfer takes place this autumn, what capital reserves will there be for transfer under clause 3 and disposal or retention under clause 4? We want to know the sums that are involved. It is a basic and important question. We want to know what is to be retained and what is to be disposed of, and in particular what the initial capital for the agency will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point, and to give the Minister adequate notice, will my hon. Friend say a word about the scale of depreciation of office furniture, office equipment, computers and motor vehicles? Page 19 of the BNOC annual report shows that the markdown is 45 per cent in one year for office equipment and motor vehicles, but the corporation apparently anticipates that office furniture has a life of only four or five years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. I had to change my car last Saturday and I do at least now understand depreciation on motor vehicles. My car, which I had not taken great care of, had depreciated considerably by the time I traded it in. I am sure that the Minister will reply to my hon. Friend's point.<br><br>
I am worried about what will be left to transfer to the agency. What has happened to BNOC assets, capital reserves and funds since March? We know the position up to March only. From what the Minister says, we know that BNOC has not lost money, as it did in the first quarter, as a result of shifting the price, which it should have done earlier. Have the assets grown? We shall not know what we are doing in passing clause 4 if we do not have that information.<br><br>
Subsection (2)(b) raises for the first time the question of the initial capital base for the new agency. BNOC operated on a capital reserve of about £30 million. Under the 1982 Act, before the national oil account was wound up, £27 million of reserves were given to BNOC as a capital reserve from which to set up and trade. We discovered on an earlier amendment that the turnover of the new agency will be between £2 million and £3 million a year. What initial capital base will be required for the agency to fulfil the modest role and function described by the Minister in Committee? We have read the Bill in vain to discover that. <br><br>
The only explanation is in the Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum. I believe that the Procedure Committee report on Public Bill procedure said how perfunctory and scrappy some explanatory and financial memoranda are. This one is a classic. To understand clause 4 one has to turn to the "Financial effects of the Bill" on page ii:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of clause 4 may give rise to—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) payments into the Consolidated Fund representing the proceeds of disposals by the Agency"—</p></blockquote>
we shall come to that shortly—
<br><blockquote><p>"a charge or charges on Votes in respect of expenditure incurred by the Agency under clause 4(1)".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is not possible to estimate accurately the amount of such payments or charges since the value of the property rights and liabilities of the Corporation transferred to the Agency cannot be ascertained until after the transfer date".</p></blockquote>
That is a sweeping statement. We are not seeking details down to the last penny. We just want a broad indication of the Bill's financial consequences. We do not need to know every little jot and title. There is a lot of information in the corporation's annual report about its fixed assets. If the Department of Energy does not know now what BNOC holds, it is in dereliction of its duty and responsibility. The Government may not have been able to provide the information when the Bill was published, but I hope that they can now give us a proper assessment of the approximate value of the property, rights and liabilities of the corporation that will be transferred to the agency.<br><br>
I approve of clause fours generally, but we want to know what we are buying in this one. We especially want to know what the capital base for the new agency will be. Is the capital base to be founded on the properties, assets and rights of the corporation?<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
BNOC's present capital reserves are £18.3 million; are those in Government securities, as was the tradition? How are the reserves that are to be transferred to the new agency now deployed? Clause 4(2)(b) provides that they will be the basic, initial capital of the agency on transfer day.<br><br>
When everything has been carved up, what happens under clause 4(3)? The Secretary of State carries off whatever is left of the loot. How much does he expect to cart off? Having disposed of the corporation and collected what he can from its properties and other assets, how much does he expect to pay into the Consolidated Fund? At the same time, under subsection (4)
<br><blockquote><p>"Any expenditure incurred by the Agency … shall … be defrayed by the Secretary of State out of money provided by Parliament".</p></blockquote>
How will that be done? Will the money come from the Department of Energy Vote? The explanatory and financial memorandum says that it will be done by
<br><blockquote><p>"a charge or charges on Votes in respect of expenditure incurred by the Agency under clause 4(1)".</p></blockquote>
This is an important stand part debate, as we must understand and unravel what will happen in the transfer of assets and the establishment of the financial structure of the new agency. I am cross with myself, in that the Opposition did not seek to amend the clause. Instead, I have tried to use the general debate to obtain the information we want, rather than seek it bit by bit. We do not, however, want general replies, but detailed answers to the series of questions that I have asked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I paused before rising, as I had assumed that some Conservative Members might feel obliged to offer a few brief comments. I believe that we were right not to seek to amend the clause, as the stand part debate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0237">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
would have given Conservative Members the opportunity to express support—and provide some justification albeit brief—for the Government's fundamental position. Clause 4 would have given Conservative Members a suitable opportunity to explain why they have given throughout our long proceedings such loyal and unquestioning support to the Minister.<br><br>
I believe that the obligation of Conservative Members was to enter the debate and defend their positions and they also had an obligation to support my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) in his call for information. We should be given that information; we should not be invited simply to jump to vote for the Government's proposition, even though it may not be justified in detail. We are being invited to jump off a cliff, and the Minister is telling us that the drop is only a little one. We want more evidence.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Woodcock), for Exeter (Mr. Hannam), for Rockford (Dr. Clark), for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens) and for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) appear to have accepted unquestioningly and tamely that the Government are determined to enact this measure and provide the House with no information.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) has not joined in the debate so far, although I am confident that he will reflect the good sense of his constituents—who are not accustomed to buying pigs in pokes, even if they are wrapped in tarten shawls—and vote with us.<br><br>
My hon. Friend posed some serious questions which should be answered. The agency will inherit contracts which will be carried on when the agency is supposed to be embarking upon a disposal policy. Trying to take opposing actions at the same time is surely enough to give anyone organisational schizophrenia. Conservative Members should have perceived the muddle and dilemma into which they will plunge the agency and they should have offered some hesitant comment on the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney.<br><br>
I do not believe that the contractual relationship to which my hon. Friend referred should be terminated in a disadvantageous manner or in reckless haste. I trust that the agency will be firmly advised that it must not be panicked into an action that would be unprofitable or disadvantageous. It should also be advised that it should not fulfil the duties in clause 4 to the extent that it fails to exercise prudence and caution. The people appointed to the agency should have been told that, despite all the political huffing and puffing that the Minister and his hon Friends have to do to please the dogmatic sections of their party, the agency will be given a quiet nod and wink not to go further than necessary on any lunatic road. Caution and prudence should be the agency's watchwords with these disposals.<br><br>
I intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney to refer to the 1984 BNOC annual report, and especially to the fixed assets, as this is an opportunity to study them in detail. BNOC may have been advised, before the Bill and before the dismantling of the corporation was announced, that it was on the way. Otherwise there is no justification for depreciation of almost one-fifth in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
office furniture, unless it was bought secondhand to start with, so that much of its useful life was exhausted before it was obtained. Such depreciation for office furniture suggests a serious fault in accounting procedures, that the furniture was not good quality to start with—it pays to buy furniture of reasonable quality—or that the dismantling of the corporation was anticipated.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and I may not be able to maintain our cars satisfactorily and diligently, I should rather be washing my dirty car than addressing hon. Members in this vain exercise of persuading them to support us. However, arrangements are invariably made to ensure that cars owned by a public body are kept clean and efficient, so that their secondhand value should be somewhat better than the secondhand value of those of busy Opposition Members who have little time to care for their cars because they are too busy caring for their constituents. As the people responsible for these cars have no constituents, their cars should be in better condition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman return to the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the clause, Mr. Knox. Let me explain. We are discussing disposals of motor vehicles, because the agency will not take the entire fleet owned by BNOC. We need detailed information about why there is such an enormous depreciation in the value of such vehicles, especially as some, if not all, will have to be disposed of by the agency. We are entitled to know how many there are and how old they are.<br><br>
We are also entitled to an assurance from the Minister that the vehicles have been properly maintained by the corporation so that the best possible price is obtained. I trust that they are British—I am one of those who believe that British motor vehicles are as good as foreign ones—and that having been properly maintained, they will attract a reasonable part-exchange price. Depreciation is an important subject. I do not know anything about computers, but they seem to be very expensive, and a depreciation of nearly 50 per cent suggests that the corporation has purchased computers and computer equipment with a very short life.<br><br>
There is also the question of tax liabilities. I am told that a number of taxes which the Government are supposed to collect are almost voluntary—indeed, someone said to me that corporation tax had actually become voluntary. We should like to know whether BNOC has opted to pay it.<br><br>
But the key item of information that we require from the Minister is an estimate of the amount of initial capital involved in subsection (2)(b). The Secretary of State must have some idea of that amount. If he has not, surely the Minister of State has; if he has not, his advisers will have. I am astonished that not a single Conservative Member has asked for that essential information. We should also like to know how much influence current levels of inflation, and the prospect of further inflation, will have on the determination of the amount.<br><br>
Our real concern, however, is about the timing of sales. We need an assurance that the agency will not be propelled into an unpropitious exercise of foolish sales

manship which would disregard both international market trends and the national interest.<br><br>
I have real doubts about sums received by the Secretary of State having to go into the Consolidated Fund. Those of us who represent mining constituencies, and see vast numbers of lay-offs taking place and more looming large on the horizon, are not satisfied with the Government's response of simply offering miners a loan. In an area where purchasing power is diminishing markedly, the prospect for small businesses is diminishing as well. "Small" loans—they may be small to the Government, but they are horrendously large to the individual—are not a particularly powerful inducement.<br><br>
I should prefer money to remain with the Secretary of State rather than be paid to the Consolidated Fund. The Secretary of State could thus give more assistance to areas like my own, that of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and those of other members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue the argument any further, because it has no relevance to the clause under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not challenge your ruling, Mr. Knox. However, I am talking about subsection (3) which says that the Secretary of State shall pay—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am well aware of what the hon. Gentleman was referring to, and aid to his constituency and the miners there has nothing to do with the Bill, the clause or the subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am entitled to argue that the Secretary of State should not have to pay into the Consolidated Fund as the Bill requires.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly entitled to argue that, but he is not entitled to argue about the expenditure or disposition of money to other things. We could otherwise discuss anything, or any Government expenditure in this country. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would keep within the confines of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your ruling, Mr. Knox. Conservative Members will gather that I would rather see the Secretary of State retain money than pay it to any fund managed by the Treasury. I believe that I am in order to say that although we dissociate ourselves entirely from the political position of the Secretary of State for Energy, it may be slightly more healthy, wise and acceptable than the political and financial policies which are so diligently observed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer who might be better off buying and selling the second-hand cars which will become available as a result of the dismantling of BNOC.<br><br>
We should be grateful if the Minister of State carried that message to his right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State. It is a message which I am sure other hon. Members, on both sides of the Committee will endorse.<br><br>
We are also entitled to expect from the Minister some information about his estimate of the costs which he may incur in the defraying of losses or payments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
from the Department of Energy. The clause is almost a totem for the Bill. It provides the Minister with excessive powers. It is a subservient genuflection to the Treasury consultative document on nationalised industries which contains one of the most centralising policies ever to have been announced in British history. It is rather a pity that the document is already being enacted in the Bill, before the House has had a proper opportunity to debate it and the policy it presents.<br><br>
I trust that all hon. Members are aware of the document and its contents. It is so serious a document and the centralising policy that it offers is so grave, that the Government should have had the decency to secure the approval of the House, if they could, for that centralisation before they started to bring in legislation to effect the proposals contained in the document. It is, in a way that we have not seen for several centuries, an enshrinement of dogma.<br><br>
In the third and fourth decades of the 17th century there were last-ditch attempts by monarchs to retain the divine right of kings. We are now seeing the Government's last-ditch attempts to retain the divine right of the Conservative party's dogma. I hope that the Minister will not mind my referring to the reign of the first James —or the sixth James from his point of view—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not go as far back as that. I do not think that it has much to do with the Oil and Pipelines Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has, Mr. Knox, in that it demonstrates an anachronism. Surely it is relevant to demonstrate that this Government are anachronistic. I shall not pursue the point, but we are not being nitpicking or pettifogging; we are going to the heart of the Bill's principle.<br><br>
Standing Committees are entitled to information. The Minister cannot expect Committee members, whether they are Conservative, Liberal or Labour, to endorse a policy which amounts to an invitation to jump into the unknown without any information being offered. I accept that some of the information we have asked for—for instance, about the depreciation of office equipment, computers and motor cars—is not as important as the central issues addressed by my hon. Friend. Nevertheless, the minor points are also relevant. They may show that measures were anticipated at a time when Ministers said that they had no intention of fulfilling the central purpose of the Bill.<br><br>
I trust that I have given the Minister and his advisers adequate time to prepare answers to my questions and those of my hon. Friend, and that he will now feel able to be forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no question of reckless haste.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Oh, no," but a few moments ago he said that he thought there had been reckless haste. I assure him that there has not; and, If I am given time to reply, I shall be happy to provide some of the information that has been asked for on this important clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Redmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Don Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only just got to my feet, but if the hon. Gentleman is burning to say something I shall generously give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservative Members must be confused as well, as they have not said a word to support or oppose what has been said by Labour Members. Perhaps if they paid attention they would be in a position to question the Minister.<br><br>
The Minister says that the Government did not proceed with undue haste. If that is so, why did they stop the inquiry that was taking place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that, if the hon. Gentleman did not listen to our Second Reading debate, he might have read the record of it. I would be wasting the Committee's time and you, Mr. Knox, might accuse me of digressing if I again went into precisely why we brought forward the Bill. But a number of important questions have been asked about clause 4 to which I am happy to respond.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) asked about the unravelling of contracts. We have already discussed that, and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman felt it necessary to return to it. Let me say again that if a contract cannot be terminated by notice under the terms of that contract, it can only be unravelled by negotiation. We may have to say that yet again before the Bill is finished. Of course improper pressure will not be put on those concerned. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) rightly said, Government policy and the purposes of the legislation have been made quite clear and unclouded to the licensees both in the Bill and in our statements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that that had been made clear both in ministerial statements and in the Bill. Where is it made clear in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the duty of the agency to dispose. That is one of the purposes of the Bill. At least my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North reads the Bill. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney surprises me, because he is normally assiduous in these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am assiduous. Clause 4 does not say contractual arrangements with small companies have to be disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not say that they have to be disposed of; it says
<br><blockquote><p>"to dispose of or discharge-the property, rights and liabilities".</p></blockquote>
The purposes of the Bill were spelt out earlier. The intention is clear.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked why the Secretary of State was required to determine which property, rights and liabilities should continue to be vested in the agency. In my view, that is a quite proper role for the Secretary of State. He has the ultimate responsibility, and it is only right for him to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
ensure that the agency retains only those property, rights and liabilities that it needs to perform its continuing functions. There is nothing improper in the Secretary of State exercising those powers.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about clause 2(1)(d). No agreement will be retained specifically for the purpose of that power, because it is an extra power to help the agency to perform its functions in connection with royalty in kind and future participation trading.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then asked some detailed questions about the BNOC accounts. Under the fixed assets heading, he asked what leasehold improvements were. I understand that they are investments that were made by BNOC to improve the offices that it leased—including, for example, the insertion or removal of partitions, and various refurbishments. As far as I know, the fixed assets—including the leasehold improvements—are still in place. It is not possible, of course, that further changes will take place between now and the transfer date.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about depreciation of furniture and vehicles. That is a matter for BNOC's accountants to determine. Any provisions made for depreciation were independently vetted by the auditors appointed by the Secretary of State. Clearly, I cannot go into details, although the hon. Member for Wentworth hoped that I would do so. Such provisions are laid down in normal accounting procedure and are vetted by auditors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer the point that I made? The level of depreciation may reflect the view of the auditors or the corporation that dismantling the corporation was imminent and that a greater markdown was therefore advisable. Is it possible to find out whether the auditors considered that aspect, and whether the corporation acted in anticipation of its destruction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman raising that point, because on numerous occasions in our debates, I and the Government have been accused of being secretive about the proposals for BNOC and of not giving notice. I explained that. Any accusation of anticipation of what might happen is extremely unlikely to be accurate. because I am sure that when the depreciation rates, and so on, were agreed there was no anticipation of dismantling. As I said, the accounts are professionally prepared, and the hon. Gentleman should rest on that.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The most important part of the speech of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney concerned the agency's likely financial structure. He asked specifically about BNOC's reserves. The financial reserves are in gilts, but there are others, such as fixed assets. The hon. Gentleman asked what the reserves were likely to be at the time of transfer. I wish to help the hon. Gentleman, but it is not possible to answer that question precisely. Certainly such costs as redundancy payments will have to come out of those reserves.<br><br>
BNOC is breaking even in broad terms on oil trading, but the contract under which it acquires oil contains provisions that could lead to expert determination of acquisition prices. A small change in those prices
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
between now and the wind-up could have a major influence on BNOC's reserves. We are still dealing with the trading position. The hon. Gentleman will have to await BNOC's final accounts to discover precisely what the reserves will be at the end of the operating period. I certainly give the general assurance to the hon. Gentleman, from what assessment can be made and subject to the cautionary remarks that I have made, that it is extremely unlikely that the reserves will be less than appropriate to the new agency.<br><br>
The agency's functions will be remunerated by the payment of fees. The required initial capital will therefore be relatively modest and certainly much less than the £30 million taken over by BNOC when it was formed. My right hon. Friend and I will discuss with the agency precisely what level of reserves will be necessary for it.<br><br>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney for not answering his questions in the considerable detail in which they were asked, as I know that they were asked in a sensible and constructive way. I hope that the Committee will accept that it is impossible, given that the corporation has some months to run, to be more precise than I have been this morning. Equally, I hope that I have been forthcoming enough to answer the genuine anxieties and desire for information about the agency's capital structure which were correctly expressed by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy). I hope that that will help us to dispose of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not have risen again, but for the Minister's assurance of professional qualification. I am sure that those involved will have considerable professional qualifications, but it will not do for the House to assume that that will make all well. We should otherwise have a high level of literacy throughout Britain, we should all reach the age of 100, and the events that occurred in the City of London last week would not have occurred. The House does have obligations.<br><br>
Will the Minister seek, either while we are in Committee or on Report, to provide my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) with information on acquisition prices? I also draw the Minister's attention to a few words to which he did not refer on clause 4(1). He reminded my hon. Friend that the duty of disposal and discharge is contained in that subsection, but he did not quote the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"on the best terms reasonably obtainable".</p></blockquote>
If the Government push the agency too far, a unilateral decision may be made to which the other party may object. That would lead to difficulties in relationships or to a company feeling that it was being bullied into terminating a contract in a way that would give a lower return than patience might have acquired and which could be exceedingly disadvantageous to another business—perhaps lethally disadvantageous to a small company.<br><br>
If a company decides to seek a remedy in the courts as a result of the impetuosity that the agency may display, there may be a legal remedy in view of the reference to "reasonably obtainable". If there is such a case, I hope that reference will be made to what has been said in Committee. Opposition Members have advised the Government to avoid such a situation, but that may occur if the words "reasonably obtainable" are given
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
the unemphatic valuation that the Minister appears to have put on them this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue a couple of matters. It is a pity that the Minister could not have given a more specific assurance. He merely said that there would be enough money in the kitty to fund the new agency. I certainly hope so. The role of the agency is simply to receive fees and to manage someone else's oil and pipelines, so sufficient money should be left out of the £18.3 million capital reserve. Furthermore, I understand that far less than £18.3 million is required to capitalise the new outfit. The Minister did not give much of a parameter.<br><br>
My ears pricked up when the Minister talked about acquisition prices. What did he mean by that? BNOC will be trading in participation oil and has unwound 80 per cent of its participation contracts, but it presumably will still be buying and selling oil until almost the transfer date. The Minister said that it would depend on the acquisition prices at that time. I presume that he was referring to the sale of participation oil in the next three months. But BNOC should lose nothing in the interim period if the agency moves with the price, as happens now. Does the Minister expect that to happen? I hope that we can debate the issue when we reach the new clauses.<br><br>
We are about to enter a period of considerable price fluctuation when the price may decline considerably. Will BNOC be in a vulnerable position or is it agreed between Ministers and BNOC that the corporation will move with the price and so not incur losses such as were incurred earlier this year and at the end of last year? If the Minister can give us his observations on those points, we shall be happy to let clause 4 stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not appropriate for me to say what I think will happen to oil prices over the next few months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would affect this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. It would be foolhardy to forecast. It follows that I should be failing in my responsibilities if I were to try to give a precise view of what may happen over the next few months. Of course the hon. Gentleman is right in general about the way in which BNOC is trading. I hope that it will not incur losses. However, the formulation of the acquisition prices that BNOC has to pay is covered by contractual provisions. There is always the possibility of a reference to experts on this, for which there is provision, or, ultimately, of litigation in the courts. I merely gave an example of the kind of uncertainty that could occur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we want to dispose of clause 4, we may as well do it by intervention and reply. Can the Minister tell us whether there are at present any references to experts on any of the prices or contractual relationships of BNOC?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an off-the-cuff answer, but subject to that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
qualification, there are none of which I am immediately aware.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) returned to the accounts. I know that the hon. Gentleman likes to be thorough; I make no criticism of him, because one cannot read everything. But on page 24 of the BNOC accounts, the second paragraph of the auditors' letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We draw attention to note 1 to the accounts which records the announcement on 13 March 1985 of the Government's intention to introduce legislation to abolish the Corporation. No provision has been made in the accounts for any potential effects of the Government's proposals and the accounts have been drawn up on a normal 'going-concern' basis."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman once and for all.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 54, in schedule 3, page 10, line 4, leave out paragraphs 1 to 6.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments go back to our discussion on the structure of the Bill and the sittings motion, when we gave notice that we would return to the provision.<br><br>
Since then, I have felt even more liverish about the structure if the Bill, particularly its financial provisions. In one way, the case was made for me. The Minister had to intervene to correct the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet), who had not noticed these provisions that were tucked away in the schedule. That summed it up. A diligent member of the Committee who has been following such matters for a number of years did not even spot that all the financial provisions, borrowing powers, and so on, were in a schedule and not in the body of the Bill. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North is strangely absent, but I hope that he will join me in supporting the amendments.<br><br>
The amendments do not affect the substance of the Bill. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am glad to see the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North back in his place. I was paying him what perhaps was a dubious compliment. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have now reached amendments Nos. 63 and 54, and I was saying that one of the exchanges that he had with the Minister confirmed the need to restructure the Bill and to bring its financial provisions into the body of the Bill instead of having them tucked away in a schedule.<br><br>
Now that we are on the last lap of the Committee stage, I wonder whether I shall have support for these two amendments. Let us do what has to be done and change the structure of the Bill. I hope that I can carry Conservative Members with me, but I assure them that the provisions make no substantial change to the Bill. We are not trying to alter the borrowing powers of the agency, nor to give it any new highfalutin' roles. We are simply saying that, in the name of good parliamentary legislative draftsmanship, we should alter the structure of the Bill and bring the schedule into the body of the Bill.</span></p>

I should have thought that paragraph 5 of schedule 3 was insufficient, Like the hon. Gentleman, I am anxious about whether the powers contained in the schedule are in the right part of the Bill. I am also concerned about whether they are sufficient for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that we shall have the opportunity to discuss that point when we debate schedule 3?. My request is more modest—that borrowing and grant-making powers, guarantees and the whole financial structure of the new agency, which are now tucked away, in the schedule, should be put into the body of the Bill. This is a parliamentary, legislative argument.<br><br>
Let me remind Committee members that we base
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
our case on "Erskine May", which defines a schedule as
<br><blockquote><p>"matters of detail dependent on the provisions of the bill."</p></blockquote>
In this case, the provision is one pathetic subsection in clause 5(3) which simply states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Schedule 3 to this Act shall have the effect for making financial and other provisions with respect to the Agency."</p></blockquote>
Whatever Committee members' views about participation agreements or the security of oil supplies, surely we all agree that clause 5(3) is a disgrace in terms of parliamentary draftsmanship and legislative presentation. Part of the financial provision for the new agency is contained in a line and a half of the body of the Bill, and the rest is thrown into a schedule. That does not conform to the definition in "Erskine May", according to which the schedule should be a matter of detail fleshing out4 the provision in the body of the Bill.<br><br>
Therefore let us register our objection as forcefully and effectively as possible by moving the schedule into the body of the Bill. I believe that I have a sporting chance of carrying the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North with me in this, and I hope that I can persuade other hon. Members to support me.<br><br>
Let me deal with the riposte given to me by the Minister in the debate on the sittings motion when he rubbed my nose in it by recalling the precedent set in the Community Land Act 1975, for which I, as minister, was responsible. The Minister enjoyed a little teasing at my expense by saying that the Land Authority for Wales was set up in that way and the Community Land Act 1975 showed that I had been personally involved in the perpetration of such an act.<br><br>
I smelt a rat when the Minister raised the point. He first made reference to the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, for which I was not responsible; that was his Government's responsibility. As I was unsure whether, 10 years ago, I had committed the sin of which I am now accusing the Government, I checked sections 8 to 12 of the Community Land Act 1975. I established the provisions for the Land Authority for Wales in 1974–75, which were different from the English provisions. That is why I can boast that they have survived the test of time and Governments.<br><br>
In the Community Land Act 1975, for which I accept full responsibility, all the financial provisions are in the body of the Act and not, as the Minister implied at our first sitting, tucked away in a schedule. They were tucked away in a schedule in the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 because that Act was a reaffirmation of the roles and responsibilities created under other legislation. In the parent legislation the provision was right in the middle.<br><br>
There may be other precedents. I have quoted Labour industry legislation. We may have done this before, but we should decide here and now that we shall not encourage, this practice. It does not make good parliamentary sense, it is not good in any scrutineering sense and it is not a decent presentation of legislation.<br><br>
The Bill is the latest in a long line of Acts on this subject. The Minister frequently quotes the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975. Whenever he is in doubt or has a poor case he says, "Something similar happened in the 1975 Act." That has been a regular refrain during our debates on the Bill, as it was on the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982. The financial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
provisions of the 1975 Act appear in the body of its text. When the Government dismantled BNOC, the financial provisions were contained in section 6 of the 1982 Act. Section 6 of the main Act has been used to cover BNOC's losses.<br><br>
It would have been disgraceful for such a wide and sweeping provision to have been included in a schedule in the 1982 Act, but it was not. The draftsmen, endorsed by the Government, said that that was the right legislative structure for such an Act, and so it is for this Bill. There is no case for tucking away major provisions covering guarantees, loans, payments and granting powers from the Secretary of State to the new agency. Those powers have been used to give £66 million and more to BNOC during the past 12 months. We have a strong case for our amendments.<br><br>
It is not good parliamentary drafting practice to tuck such responsibilities and powers away in schedules. Financial matters are the particular concern of the Commons. The rights of Parliament developed from the concept of financial scrutiny. I spend some of my spare time writing a book on a group of Members of Parliament from the Marcher counties in the 1690s who came to the House of Commons. They were country gentry, not radicals, though they became more radical as the 1690s wore on. Their chief aim was to make sure that the increasing amounts of public money expended as a result of William III's wars on the continent were well spent. They wanted to scrutinise and control expenditure.<br><br>
We seem to have gone backwards, not forwards, in the scrutiny of our expenditure. We do not do much on estimates and appropriations these days. The amateur country gentry of the 1690s insisted that the House of Commons went through all Army estimates line by line, down to each general's expenditure. They set up a commission of accounts—the first Public Accounts Committee. They realised that parliamentary democracy depended on detailed scrutiny of the Executive's financial arrangements. It was fundamental to their case that parliamentary democracy, haphazard and developing as it was in the 1690s, depended on detailed financial scrutiny. They went down to the nitty gritty. Their Public Accounts Committee was selected from the House as a whole, with none of the "usual channels" nonsense, and hon. Members dropped their ballots in the glass on the Table of the House.<br><br>
If we accept this financial structure and demote the financial provisions of the Bill to a schedule we are going backwards rather than forwards. We believe that the financial structure should be the main substance of the Bill, and that is what the amendment seeks to achieve.<br><br>
Irrespective of where we stand on the Bill, and irrespective of the issues raised in the Committee proceedings, I think that here we might expect some genuine, all-party support for our amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to ask my right hon. Friend the Minister one question. I have looked at the financial provisions under schedule 3 and find paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 comprehensive.<br><br>
However, on the Petroleum and Submarines Pipelines Act 1975 I raised a question. The Minister may feel that is a long time ago, but it refers also to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982. There, all the borrowing powers are in the substantive part of the Act. I refer to section 7. I think that the new trend of Government to push financial provisions into schedules is a dangerous practice.<br><br>
I have just served on the Standing Committee considering the Food and Environment Protection Bill, where everything has gone into the regulations at the back of the Bill. One is not supposed to read the small print. The time will come when we create a Bill with a general power—it will be a sweeping power, too—and everything else will be confirmed in regulations and in schedules 1 to 10.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister has a reasonable explanation other than the fact that this is just the trend of the times and that it is more convenient to the Executive. The specific and important matters in a Bill should appear in substantive part of its text and not in the minor sections at the end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the tentative but honourable words of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). He has to some extent balanced the monosyllabic inertia of Conservative Members. Even though it is June, they seem almost hibernant in their approach to the Bill.<br><br>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has left the Room. He has made a serious mistake in drawing the attention of Conservative Members to his part in the creation of the Land Authority for Wales. My hon. Friend was imprudent. Conservative Members woke up at that moment because the authority was created by a Labour Government. Even though it is superbly commendable, it is now threatened. Conservative Members will want to get rid of it to promote the interests of the land sharks with whom they have sympathy.<br><br>
The amendment is commendable and responsible. I hope that the Minister will think carefully before he seeks to persuade his private army to vote against it. It is a meaningful offering and reflects the principles that draw us to the House. It is entirely in accordance with constitutional propriety, it serves the cause of democracy and of democractic character within legislation, and it will recentre the Bill, shifting it away from its present top-heavy condition.<br><br>
It would be wrong to labour the point, but the Bill has four and a half pages of clauses and almost 10 pages of schedules. Its balance is wrong. Impatient ruthlessness is responsible for this unwholesome disregard for political sensitivity.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to the independent approach of Marcher Members of Parliament in the 1690s. I entered the House in 1970. In the first Standing Committees on which I served, Conservative Back Benchers took part with a display of some vigilance. In my first major Standing Committee, two hon. Members who sat behind the Minister were prepared to defend the reputation and character of Parliament. Members of this Committee should consider the amendment, which is not partisan, but an illustration of the commitment to parliamentary democracy which they would be ill advised to spurn.</span></p>

<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wallace <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments. When the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) raised this issue during the sittings motion, the Minister rightly pointed out that provisions in a schedule carry as much statutory force as those in a clause, and thus a section in an Act, if they were considered in a court of law. However, some people feel that if a provision is consigned to a schedule, it is secondary and not as important.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said that Parliament's role has traditionally been to scrutinise public finance. It would be regrettable for such matters to be included in schedules. Although a provision in a schedule or clause should have equal force, the burden of proof is on the Minister to explain why there has been this change from a tradition of many years. If he cannot explain he does not deserve the Bill to be passed as it is, and the amendment should be carried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. The 19 words in subsection (3) are not relevant. The main theory behind the Bill has been public scrutiny over money. I understood that BNOC's losses last year and early this year were a reason for the Bill. Surely demoting public finance to a schedule is not doing justice to all the arguments in favour of the Bill. It is wrong to demote public finance to a schedule. Parliament should debate it in greater detail in a clause, and thus debate a much stronger Bill. Major provisions should not be hidden away in schedule 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), the location of a provision in a schedule or in the main part of the Bill does not limit the opportunity for debate. We have an equal opportunity to debate it, in Committee or on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
We had an opportunity to debate this matter on the sittings motion. In reply to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) I was right that in the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 the financial powers were put into a schedule. However, the hon. Gentleman is also correct that, in the parent Act, the financial powers are included in the body of the Bill. In the sporting spirit of Wimbledon week, I shall start with 15-all.<br><br>
One has to decide whether to put financial powers into the main body of the Bill or in schedules. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) implied that that was a change from precedent. In this case there are precedents both ways, so he may have trouble in making up his mind. Important Acts serve as examples. I have given the example of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. One can go back to the time of the previous Government. I use these examples for the benefit of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. There was the Industry Act 1975, which the hon. Gentleman acknowledges. That was not an insubstantial Act. I remind the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) that that Act covered the borrowing powers of the National Enterprise Board, Government loans to the National Enterprise Board, the borrowing of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Treasury guarantees and so on. It was a substantial Bill with substantial powers, and substantial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
sums of money were involved. Ten years ago the Labour Government decided to put those powers in legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were wrong to put them in the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another two examples—one of which will certainly interest the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland—are the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975 and the Welsh Development Agency Act 1975. Schedule 2 of the Scottish Act and schedule 3 of the Welsh Act are identical. Again, all the financial provisions were put in a schedule and not in the main body of the Bill. Precedent therefore goes both ways. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. Do you think that you should defend the safety of members of the Committee? One hon. Member behind the Minister appears to be under threat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I saw no member of the Committee under threat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The precedent goes both ways. It is to some extent a matter of judgment whether the financial powers are put into the main body of the Bill or into the schedule. In this case, we decided on the schedule. I know that I have the support of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland about this. It has the same legal force in the schedule as in the Bill itself. I do not think that there is a fundamental question at issue here and it would therefore be better to leave the Bill as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not have risen again had it not been for the mockery of the Minister's statement that the fact that the provision is in a schedule does not prevent debate. While he was saying that, his hon. Friend the Government Whip, the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant)—a perfectly pleasant man whom I have known for a long time and whom I regard favourably apart from his office and his party alignment—sat in a posture redolent of menacing aggression. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Not content with that, he then wandered round the Room—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The demeanour of the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant) is not relevant to the amendment that we are discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not be relevant to the debate, but it is very relevant to the vote that will take place shortly. I shall not press the matter further. However, it was offensive for the Minister to say that we can debate the matter, knowing that his hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West would do his utmost to prevent Conservative Members from taking part in the debate. It is not much of a debate when the Opposition put questions of great importance in terms of their constitutional character and only the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet), in a tentative, but honourable, way can make a brief intervention from the Conservative Benches. It is quite deplorable.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is time to draw a line on the behaviour of all Governments in this regard. That is why we can speak in an all-party spirit. Yes, there were occasions when it was done. It is wrong but it is increasingly being done. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) rightly pointed out the growth of enabling legislation. It was an interesting point about the way in which a legislation programme can be put through with a minimum legislative base. We are taking note of all this. Let us at least draw a line now on the past, stand up for a good piece of parliamentary legislative presentation and vote for our amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another growing tendency in legislation is the belt and braces approach, which is no more evident than in clause 5(2). Having gone through all the details, carefully setting up the balance of relationships, the powers of the agency and so on, we find this enormous, sweeping provision stating.:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Agency shall have power to do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is incidental or conducive to, the exercise of performance of any of its functions under this Act".</p></blockquote>
No wonder the Government are never challenged in the courts—they have a good sweep up in every Bill to ensure that they cover anything that may have been missed elsewhere. That is classic British legislative style, but we ought to ask ourselves whether we should endorse it. No doubt the Minister will cite 24 occasions between 1974 and 1979 when we included sweep-up provisions containing phrases such as "incidental to", "conducive to" and "anything calculated to facilitate".<br><br>
At the tail end of this sweeping subsection we find the power:
<br><blockquote><p>"to appoint other persons to exercise or perform any of those functions on its behalf".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us a little more about that? Presumably, it would allow the contracting out of the management of royalty oil. I thought that the whole point was that royalty oil belonged to the Crown and was the responsibility of the Secretary of State, yet clause 5(2) would allow the management of royalty oil to be contracted out to a body other than the agency.<br><br>
What kind of people are we considering in the provisions? Can other persons be appointed to manage the Government's pipeline and storage system? The agency
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
will have the power to appoint other persons to exercise or perform "any of its functions" under the Bill.<br><br>
Hon. Members were denied details of certain of the agency's functions on the grounds that they were commercial secrets and that national security was involved, but we now discover that those functions can be put out to contract in one form or another.<br><br>
Is the provision included to accommodate the point made by the hon. Member for Erewash (Mr. Rost) on Second Reading? The hon. Gentleman said then that the functions should be given to private enterprise. He was keen that the agency should contract out to smaller private companies. Is clause 5(1)(a) and (b) designed to cover that point? The provisions have a familiar ring. They are standard provisions on the power of the Secretary of State to give "general or specific direction". When the Conservative party was in oppostion, it used to complain about powers of direction, but I notice that it has carried on the same time-honoured provision. Will the Minister explain clause 5(2)?</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, at least in this, I shall carry my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) with me all the way.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has rightly said that we are dealing with hallowed phrases that every Government put into every piece of legislation such as this. I am glad to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North that the schedule carries forward provisions in the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 and follows the precise precedent that he raised.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is correct in saying that clause 5 is a belt and braces clause that has been included to clear up any doubt. He went on to ask a specific question about the sub-agency function. An example would be of the sub-contracting of a storage installation, or part of a pipeline storage system, where at present the operation is carried out directly by the Department of Energy's agents. The clause could come into operation in such an instance, and so it is right to have it in the Bill.</span></p>

FINANCIAL AND OTHER PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 62, in page 10, line 47, leave out "£80 million" and insert "£85 million".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are important amendments on financial provisions. They deal with the agency's borrowing powers, which the Opposition have failed to get into the body of the Bill. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) did not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
vote in accordance with his observations on that matter.<br><br>
What does the £20 million to £80 million provision include? That is a wide span. The minimum financial borrowing power is £20 million. That means that the agency can borrow up to that limit without obtaining further consent from the Secretary of State. If the agency wants to borrow more than that, it must seek the Secretary of State's approval. Paragraph 2(1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not at any time exceed £20 million or such greater amount, not exceeding £80 million, as the Secretary of State may by order specify".</p></blockquote>
I shall come to the way in which he will specify in a minute, but first I should like to know where those figures have come from and what assumptions have been made.<br><br>
The Minister told us earlier that he could not give us many clues about the capital structure of the agency, but he must have a clue about why these figures have been produced. They must have a financial basis. The Minister told us since the beginning of the Committee stage that the agency will have a low profile and minimum power and responsibility, and that its task will be merely to manage the pipeline and the royalty oil belonging to the Crown. It will, he says do little else except perhaps a little bit around the edges to enhance or support the royalty oil provisions in the Bill. In other words, it will be a small, downbeat operation, which we have attempted to make a bit more upbeat.<br><br>
But, lo and behold! When we look at the borrowing powers of this downbeat, minimal agency, we find a suggested minimum requirement of £20 million, with the right to go up to £80 million. For one thing, I find the jump considerable. I should also like to know on what basis a £20 million borrowing power is required for the agency.<br><br>
Consistent with our arguments so far is our belief that the agency should have a more expansive role, and that it will therefore require a larger borrowing power than the Minister's baseline of £20 million and his limit of £80 million. Our amendments are also intended to find out the basis on which the Government's figures were arrived at. Page 11 of BNOC's annual report tells us that BNOC's borrowing limit last year was £100 million, and that the Secretary of State had consented to short-term borrowings of up to £75 million. It is interesting to note that BNOC stayed within that limit. Even when it went bust, it went for Government grants rather than an increased borrowing power. I should be grateful if the Minister could shed some light on the balance between borrowing and grant powers in BNOC, because exactly the same arrangements are being put into the Bill to deal with the agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When such large sums feature in a Bill it is obviously right to discuss them. No one questions the agency's need for borrowing powers, although we hope that it will not normally need to borrow. Borrowing may arise in relation to the power that we give to the agency to trade on its account although, as I said earlier, that will be limited to what is necessary to maximise receipts from royalty in kind. We believe that the agency will trade much less frequently than BNOC, and its borrowing limit of £20 million compared with BNOC's current £25 million reflects that.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
There is nothing sacrosanct about the sum: it is what we believe will be necessary, but we cannot definitively rule out the possibility of a greater or lesser sum.<br><br>
I shall explain how this kind of need would arise, in order to put the sum in context. Suppose the agency has to buy a full cargo of oil on its own account to cover a commitment that could not be met because a cargo of royalty oil had not been delivered when it was expected. Payment for the agency's purchase might fall due a day or two before the agency was paid by its customer. That might occur either because the customer was accidentally late in paying, or because, if the usual 30-day credit period expired at a weekend, the agency would have to pay on a Friday and be paid on the following Monday.<br><br>
The need to borrow will require a simultaneous combination of circumstances. We therefore expect the agency to borrow the value of a full cargo—say, £12 million to £15 million—only occasionally. It would be appropriate for the agency to be able to borrow in those circusmstances. We are therefore setting the agency's lower limit at £20 million to allow for variations in oil prices and exchange rates, and to enable that limit to last for a number of years.<br><br>
I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that there are reasons for the sum of money. One cannot state definitively that it should be £20 million, £15 million or £25 million, but it is related to the value of a full cargo of oil, it allows for the contingency of fluctuations in the exchange rate and it is designed to last for a reasonable period.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the higher limit. The purpose of the higher limit is to cover the agency's needs in the event that it ever resumes full participation trading. The limit of £80 million is comparable to BNOC's present limit on temporary borrowing to cover participation trading; the sum has proved to be sufficient over the last couple of years, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is a sensible one.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked why borrowings were not used to cover losses incurred by BNOC during the past six months or so. BNOC could not have used temporary borrowing to cover last year's losses because there was no prospect of repaying such borrowing and the losses would have had to be financed out of reserves. As those reserves were inadequate to cover the scale of losses involved, the losses had to be covered by grant money.<br><br>
I freely admit that the size of such sums of money is open to argument. No one can say that a particular sum of money is precisely right. I hope, however, that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the two sums have been sensibly worked out on the basis of the kinds of liabilities that the new agency might face. Certainly, the higher limit, operable if participation trading were reintroduced, is based on our experience with BNOC. Therefore, both the figures are sensibly and properly arrived at.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply is entirely unconvincing. I was glad to hear him say that he could not be absolutely definitive. He accepted that flexibility was necessary and then proceeded to demonstrate, by his rejection of our amendments, absolute inflexibility. That seems a little preposterous.<br><br>

The Government need to acknowledge their fallibility. Even though they acknowledge that the situation cannot be precisely determined, their fallibility is not left open to question.<br><br>
If we consider the reality of the economic and financial record, we see ample justification for the amendment. The Government suggested that there would be only 3 per cent inflation. It is now more than 7 per cent. They suggested a year ago that interest rates would be much lower than they are today. We cannot have a great deal of faith in the Government's calculations. That is why we have tabled the amendments which challenge the assumption that £20 million will be the normal maximum indebtedness and that £80 million will be the maximum which can remotely be permissible. The amendments demonstrate our belief that the Government should recognise that flexibility is desirable, and they should acknowledge their economic fallibilities.<br><br>
Our proposal to substitute £25 million for £20 million is an increase of only 25 per cent. As inflation is twice as high—200 per cent higher—than that forecast by Ministers only a year or two ago, our amendment is modest. Our other amendment proposes to raise the sum of £80 million to £85 million. That is an increase of only 6.25 per cent. That is also a modest amendment. If the Minister wants the Committee to maintain good will and if he wants to demonstrate his attachment to flexibility and act reasonably, he should accept these perfectly moderate, sensible and flexible amendments. The Minister has the opportunity to say that it is not his fault and that we can cock a snook at the Treasury which, I am sure, will provide him with quiet pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: More than quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman would be able to offer the excuse that the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant) told him that he could not deliver the support of his hon. Friends.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will reconsider the Government's dreadful economic record. The fact that inflation is twice as high as the Government promised is ample justification for the modest amendments. I see no reason why the Government could not show that touch of flexibility to which the Minister previously has professed an attachment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If Conservative Back Benchers are awake, they will begin to worry about the Minister's explanation for the borrowing powers. Some hon. Members thought that the £20 million was a reinforcement of the function of clause 2(1)(d). It now turns out that the £20 million is needed to finance the additional activities of the agency. Those Conservative Members who had a liverish view of the creation of the agency should be queazy about endorsing the borrowing powers limit. It is clear that the Minister is up to a touch of the Keynesians and that he is preparing for the agency to be activated to buy the odd extra cargo.<br><br>
I assumed from what the Minister said that the £80 million borrowing power would be sufficient for the activation of all participation agreements. He explained that it was the amount for which BNOC could exercise full participation rights. We shall not press amendment No. 62 in relation to the £80 million. Clearly the agency
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
will have the flexibility to exercise all the participation agreements and to finance them on the current borrowing figure of BNOC—although perhaps Conservative Back Benchers should have some qualms about the amount involved.<br><br>
However, I am not prepared to accept the £20 million figure. The Minister explained that we are discussing the agency's right to buy under clause 2 the odd additional cargo. Such cargos cost £12 million to £15 million, and he told us that there must be a certain leeway in this respect; problems could arise and a lot of money could be lost in some circumstances. We propose a rather modest increase to £25 million, which represents perhaps two cargoes. I wish that I had been more expansive about amendment No. 61; I now realise that there should have been provision for underwriting the borrowing powers and that the figure should have been rather larger. But at least we shall stick to the £25 million. Indeed as it is possible that the price of oil will fall in the coming months, we may get more for our money.<br><br>
I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of how the figures arose; they were not plucked from the air, but calculated carefully. But Back Bench Conservatives should be worried about some of them. We draw modest relief from the £80 million figure, but as we feel that the £20 million should be increased substantially we wish to press amendment No. 61 to a division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 11, line 39, leave out "section" and insert "paragraph".<br><br>
Nothing gives me more delight than being able to respond promptly to what the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) said a few moments ago—namely, that it is time that the Government and I acknowledged our fallibility. I make that acknowledgement. Indeed, I shall put on my hair shirt in front of the Committee. Amendment No. 65 is merely a drafting amendment to put right something in paragraph 4 of schedule 3 that is incorrect and that unfortunately I failed to spot before the Bill was published. Therefore I speak to the amendment in all humility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We appreciate the graceful way in which the Minister introduced his amendment. I did not think that I would ever hear such comments from a Minister in this Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or any Administration.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0248">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have heard Ministers in other Administrations confess fallibility, but I have never heard a Minister in the Government who took office in 1979 offer so graceful an explanation as that which the Minister gave us this morning. For that reason, because we appreciate his humility and generosity of language and as we are delighted to have been given at least one confession of fallibility by a Minister in this Government, we should not oppose the amendment, although we are entitled to express regret that the only amendments that appear likely to be accepted are those of this minor nature which are proposed by the Minister.<br><br>
I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will not get into trouble with those superior to him in rank in this Administration for the confession that he offered the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Third Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have dealt with matters of substance in our amendments, but it would be worthwhile to seek an explanation from the Minister of one or two aspects of the schedule.<br><br>
First, the schedule is scattered with references to Treasury consent. My hon. Friend invited the Minister to cock a snook at the Treasury and he should remember Mr. Harold Macmillan's sage advice that there are only three institutions which the Government should never try to overrule—the National Union of Mineworkers, the Roman Catholic Church and the Treasury. We have invited the Minister to ignore that advice in relation to the Treasury.<br><br>
Paragraph 1(1) of the schedule states that the agency may borrow temporarily by way of overdraft in sterling. However, it also says that, with consent, it may be possible for it to borrow in currency other than sterling. As there is substantial trading in dollars, does that paragraph mean that the agency will need to seek approval from the Secretary of State each time it wishes to borrow a single dollar? Will that provision apply to every transaction or will there be an agreement for it to trade in dollars for a six-month period? I should have thought that the agency would be involved in a great deal of dollar trading, as it will be dealing in oil. Will it sell in sterling? I shall be grateful if the Minister will explain the curious provision in paragraph 1(1)(b) and tell us exactly what sort of consent will be required from the Secretary of State. If it needs to be sought in each transaction, there could be a most time consuming to-ing and fro-ing between the Department of Energy and the agency.<br><br>
There is another matter that I intend to raise when we reach one of the new clauses. However, paragraph 1(2) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency shall not—
<ol>
<li>borrow money otherwise than in accordance with subparagraph (1) above; or</li>
<li>except with the consent of the Secretary of State and the approval of the Treasury—</li>
<ol>
<li>lend money, charge any of its actual or future assets or give any surety or guarantee".</li>
</ol></ol></p></blockquote>
and so on. As I shall argue rather more strenuously when we come to new clauses relating to prices, trends and so on, there may be a case for the agency to take a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
position in relation to the futures market in oil, which is growing. There may be occasions when it would be sensible for it to take a view about those futures because it may wish to act in a certain way in regard to
<br><blockquote><p>"its actual or future assets".</p></blockquote>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Does paragraph 1(2) forbid the agency not only to trade forward, but to take part in the futures market if it considered that that was necessary for the enhancing and maximising of the value of the royalty oil it was managing?<br><br>
There are references in the schedule to subsidiaries. What subsidiaries will the agency create? BNOC had an odd collection of subsidiaries. Page 19 of the BNOC annual report mentions—besides BNOC (Trading) Limited, BNOC (PAD) Limited and BNOC (Participation) Limited—a company called British Marine Pipelines Limited, England. I dislike the racist concept of that company, but it has been wound up. Perhaps it was wound up because of the racist concept. It does not seem to have done anything. References to subsidiaries are scattered through schedule 3.<br><br>
Will the Minister comment on payment to the Secretary of State, Treasury guarantees and so on? It looks like a form of time-hallowed wording. Is that correct? I hope that we are not missing anything by not going through the measure line-by-line. Paragraph 9(4) gives the Secretary of State power to say that he wants accounts prepared in a specific way. The Minister of State will recall that he used that when arguing against one of my amendments which provided that the pipeline division of the agency should prepare accounts. I hope that the Minister will now tell us that the pipeline division of the agency will prepare accounts. They would be a little more manageable and understandable than those tucked away in the annual accounts of the British National Oil Corporation. Will the Minister clarify those points?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important schedule to the Bill. Not many amendments to the schedule have been tabled and I understand why the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) raises these points.<br><br>
The way in which the accounts are to be prepared is expressed in a normal and proper form in the schedule, but I shall reflect on what the hon. Gentleman said. That does not conflict with anything that I said earlier.<br><br>
The payment to the Secretary of State and the control of the Treasury are time-hallowed powers in a Bill of this nature and therefore are regarded as normal.<br><br>
In relation to borrowing in other currencies, it is correct that, as the hon. Gentleman said, the price of oil is expressed in dollars, but that does not necessarily mean that it is paid in dollars. Normally, payments are made in sterling, but—the hon. Gentleman anticipated what I am about to say—there may be occasions when it is sensible to hedge in one way or another for currency changes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of subsidiaries, especially British Marine Pipelines Limited. That is a joint subsidiary of BNOC and British Gas to hold the public sector interests in the gas-gathering pipelines company, a defunct company which was studying gas gathering in 1978–79.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0249">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the futures market. Paragraph 1(1) does not prevent the agency from taking a position in a market that deals with charges and future assets. But it would do so under clause 2(1)(d) only in relation to the incidental provisions of clause 5. I do not expect the agency to operate in the futures market, and I hope that I have clarified the legal position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, can we take it that none of the provisions in paragraph 1(1) or (2) of schedule 3 prevents the agency taking a position on a futures market?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, it is clear that it would be reasonable and proper for the agency to keep separate accounts for the pipeline division under these provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter for the agency. If it chose to keep separate accounts it could do SO.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, there would be no reason for the Secretary of State to specify—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is conducting himself as if this were Question Time. Is the hon. Gentleman making a speech or not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a speech if you wish me to, Mr. Knox.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must appreciate that he cannot question the Minister as he has been doing. He must either make a speech or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a speech. I am seeking clarification of whether the accounting procedures outlined in schedule 3 will enable the agency to deal separately with the accounts in respect of pipelines. That is relevant and important to new clause 1. I wish to ensure that I do not omit anything in respect of schedule 3 that would jeopardise my position in respect of new clause 1.<br><br>
I gather from the Minister's responses to my questions that that is the position, in which case, despite having some qualms about schedule 3 which have been expressed in our amendments, we know that we are not jeopardising new clause 1 by allowing schedule 3 to go through. I have jealously guarded new clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want any confusion to arise. The Department and the Secretary of State will be ultimately responsible for the pipeline system and the agency will simply manage it. I do not wish to mislead
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
the Committee into believing that the accounts relate to more than simply the management function.<br><br>
The position is covered in paragraph 9(2) which states that the amounts must give
<br><blockquote><p>"a true and fair view".</p></blockquote>
I hope that I have covered the point about which the hon. Gentleman is worried.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments make minor changes to the repeals contained in schedule 4. They provide that paragraph 26 of schedule 3 to the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 should be repealed when BNOC is dissolved rather than on the transfer. This is desirable because paragraph 26 provides that BNOC should have between five and 12 members, and, of course, BNOC's board will need to remain in existence until the corporation is dissolved. It is therefore a change to cover a problem that has come to light.</span></p>
