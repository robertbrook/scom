<div class='page-header'><h1>Shipbuilding Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Shipbuilding Bill, the Committee does meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Butcher.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the Room. I call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Dixon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Jarrow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Shersby. The financial resolution has been drawn very tightly. However, we have had no details of the way in which the redundancy payments are to be made. Previous statutory instruments have always made it clear that the payment would be at X level multiplied by Y. Obviously that matter will arise in Committee because it has not been raised since the last statutory instrument in 1982.<br><br>
No figure was mentioned during Second Reading by either the Minister of State or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, although questions were asked. We allowed the financial resolution to go unchallenged then because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) said, we could raise it in Committee. I hope that the debate will not be so narrow that we cannot raise important questions. They are certainly important to the men who face redundancy and will possibly spend the rest of their lives on the dole. They will want to know how much they will get.<br><br>
Therefore, Mr. Shersby, I hope that you will allow us to ask the questions and allow the Minister to answer them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that point of order. It will be in order for those matters to be raised on clause 1.</span></p>

SCHEMES UNDER THE 1978 ACT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 5, leave out "and six months".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 5, leave out "six months" and insert "three months".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a short Bill, but the Opposition consider it very important. It was published during the recess—I think on 3 January—without warning. At that time we had no information on what was proposed. The Bill was then debated in the first week after the recess.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The Opposition will not prolong the Committee unnecessarily or attempt to wreck it. In principle, we must accept the proposed extension. However, the financial resolution has been tightly drawn, as my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) said, and we feel that some flexibility from you, Mr. Shersby, would be in order, given that it is a very short Bill and we believe that we can cover all the main points in a relatively short time.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is not to reduce the period to the disadvantage of those who might benefit from it, and we shall not be putting it to a vote. Its purpose is to bring about a debate before the end of 1986, the time envisaged for the 18-months extension. The subsequent amendments are very relevant, and we shall be moving at least two of them. But as the Bill is now drafted, when the scheme runs out this time it will get the final chop. We are used to the Government's policy of chopping—it is their only policy—but they have not chopped this scheme before, and if they would allow us the option of a specific debate before the end of 1986, we would even withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
We want to know why the Government feel that this is the right time to terminate the scheme. On Second Reading, the Minister of State made great play of the fact that Opposition Members could not foresee the future of the industry, but neither can he or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary. I do not see why Conservative Members should resist the possibility of a debate. They cannot wait to get shot of the industry—that was the purpose of privatisation and of trying to sell off the warship yards.<br><br>
The Minister of State has made it clear that when all the warship yards are sold—the Government intend to do that by the end of next year at the latest—and following the disposal of ship repair yards and of Scott Lithgow last year, there will be only 11,000 employed in the ship repairing industry and only 18,000 employed in the public sector as a whole. As my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow pointed out, the Belfast yards are covered by a different and even more generous scheme.<br><br>
The Minister has leapt to the assumption that he is going to dispose of all the warship yards, and that may well happen. No doubt the write-offs that we shall discuss later, the tidying up of balance sheets and the removal of all financial obligations and liabilities from those companies will take place, and will make them very attractive prospects. When we learn that GEC is interested in Yarrow, we begin to think that this is yet another state rip-off. But that is not our point today. We do not accept that all the warship yards will be sold in that period.<br><br>
Much has been made of the fact that there will be only 11,000 employees left, and that now is the appropriate moment to get rid of the scheme once and for all. But, since it began in 1978, the scheme has always been left open for extension by statutory instrument in the light of the prevailing circumstances. How can the Under-Secretary be so sure that there will be only 11,000 employees? Of course, there may be even fewer, if the Government have their way and privatisation goes ahead, if the warship yards are sold and the Government's economic policies are pursued. I am very conscious of the regional policy announced last week which involves further massive cuts for the very regions that will be most affected.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Hon. Members will be aware from last week's debate that I am committed on regional issues. Shipbuilding is, above all, a regional issue, and there is to be a massive cut of £300 million per year, reducing the payment by 60 to 70 per cent. How can the Under-Secretary be sure that there will be 11,000 people and that he can sell the shipyards? There are so many uncertainties in this and I ask him seriously to reconsider yet again the question of aid that was put to him on Second Reading. The Bill is distasteful because it is so narrow in its approach to the whole industry. It is concerned with only one issue, and negatively with that one issue.<br><br>
We think that 11,000 people are of great importance and that it is wrong to stop a scheme which has worked so well—one that was, of course, initiated by a Labour Government. The industry has contracted from 80 per cent of world shipping at the end of the war to the Government's projection of 1.5 to 2 per cent. Given that tendency, can we be sure that there will be 11,000 people? Can the Minister be sure that he will be able to dispose of the warship yards? Given those uncertainties, why is he taking a decision now to put an end to the scheme?<br><br>
One reason to end the scheme was put forward on Second Reading—that there would be only 11,000 people. We think that that is a great many people. We do not know whether the Government will be able to sell the warship yards, even though we know that they are prepared to flog all their national assets at any price, no matter the social or commercial loss. That happened with British Telecom and with Jaguar. Perhaps they will give away the yards—and part II of the Bill moves in that direction—but we cannot be sure. Above all, we do not know that there might not be more than 11,000 people or that a scheme might be required within this period to deal with what could well be a terminal situation for the commercial side of the business.<br><br>
There was nothing in the announcement on 3 January by the Government that would prolong the extension by statutory instrument so that it could be reviewed in six months' or a year's time, which is the purpose of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to selling the warship yards, but other yards are also involved. Swan Hunter, whose yards are mainly in the constituencies of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett), has always been termed a mixed yard—it builds warships and merchant ships—and that yard is also to be sold. Swan Hunter has built many famous merchant ships and liners, and could have built the Royal Princess if the order had not gone to Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a valid point. It is not strictly relevant to the amendment, although it comes back to my point of how we can be sure that there will be only 11,000 people. It will be even more difficult to sell mixed yards. Is it the Government's intention to split the yards prior to selling them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is wandering far from the amendment and returning to points made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
on Second Reading. I ask the hon. Gentleman to confine his remarks to the terms of the amendment.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to do that, Mr. Shersby. In a sense, we are trying to get a debate on the subject before the scheme runs out at the end of 1986, when it will no longer be subject to statutory instrument. We do not want to reduce the period of time involved. The only purpose of the amendment is to allow us to debate the matter with the Government before the scheme ends, be it in three months or six months. What we are trying to do is entirely relevant.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow was not trying to prolong matters—the Bill is limited, and we are clear about that. Given the tightness of the money resolution, not many constructive amendments can be tabled. This amendment is certainly not a wrecking amendment.<br><br>
What my hon. Friend said at the beginning of the debate was right. We were warned, of course—the Government introduced the proposal in December. We shall not put the amendment to the vote. We are trying to elicit from the Government why they are taking a decision now to end the scheme without any opportunity for debate. The amendment is a probing amendment, not a wrecking amendment. Each individual has his own redundancy problem and whole communities are involved—for example, Merseyside, Clydeside and the north-east to take three of the major regions. That is why we seek to know the Government's reasons for ending the Scheme.<br><br>
We have to probe the Second Reading debate in detail to see whether the Government's arguments stand up in Committee. During Second Reading they said that only 11,000 people would be involved, so that what the Minister called the whole panoply of a statutory scheme was no longer relevant. I do not propose to go into that now as it will arise on clause stand part or under amendment No. 4. However, we think that 11,000 are a great many people. Given, the Government's policy towards the industry, even fewer people could be involved, which makes us all the more anxious to debate the provisions for them.<br><br>
How can the Minister be sure that it will be possible to sell the warship yards? The Government may dress up the balance sheets as much as they want, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow said, there are some mixed yards which could have a bearing on the numbers before the end of 1986. The provisions are very worrying. The arguments that the Government have adduced so far for wishing to end the scheme now do not stand up to scrutiny.<br><br>
I want to put just one point to the Under-Secretary which will show you, Mr. Shersby, that progress is being made. We are not convinced that the numbers are o correct. We are not convinced that the policy is correct. We believe that there will be a much bigger problem than the Under-Secretary envisages in the final closing down of a scheme that has operated so well. We see no need for that. However we shall not push the amendment to a vote. We need further explanation and hope that the Under-Secretary can tell us why we cannot at least have an undertaking from the Government that we can debate this issue. That has happened at every other stage since the scheme was first introduced in 1978.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0273">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the Opposition do not want to shorten the period nor do we want to save the Government the money they will have to pay people for the rest of their lives—dole money for two years and then social security benefits. People can draw social security if they have spent their redundancy payments two years after being made redundant.<br><br>
The amendment was tabled for psychological reasons. The Bill is an example of the Government's political dogma. The shipyards were nationalised in June 1977. The Conservative party strongly opposed it and has continued to oppose it. The length of time that the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, introduced by the last Labour Government, spent in Committee went into the Guinness Book of Records. Every June the scheme has been extended. The purpose of the amendment is to change the extension period back to June.<br><br>
Many shipyard workers remember June as the month in which the shipbuilding industry was saved in 1977. That has the same psychological effect on the Tories as May Day—they are trying to change May Day too because it sticks in their gut. June every year sticks in their gut when they think of the shipbuilding industry. Had the last Labour Government not nationalised the shipbuilding industry in June 1977 and been successful in getting the Polish orders we would not be here today discussing this innocuous Bill—I use the words of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in his closing speech on Second Reading.<br><br>
If amendment No. 4 is accepted, the Government can extend the scheme until June 1987 or June 1988. That will not transgress the money resolution. That depends on whether this amendment is accepted and the Government are given the powers to extend the scheme under the 1978 Act.<br><br>
When we talk about extending redundancy pay we are not talking about golden handshakes such as those that Conservatives Members know about, when chairmen of various industries receive £35,000, £45,000, £55,000 and £90,000. We are talking about shipyard workers who, if the amendment is carried, will receive in the next 12 months average redundancy pay of about £5,000. I did not invent that figure. It has come from the Vote Office and is included in the Bill.<br><br>
Many of those who receive between nothing and £5,000 will have to live on it for the rest of their lives. There is virtually no chance of their getting a job in such areas as Tyne and Wear and parts of Scotland. That applies also to Cammell Laird in the north-west and to Harland and Wolff in Northern Ireland. Compared with the redundancy scheme offered to the mineworkers, with the scheme offered to the steelworkers, when steel work was cut down, and with the scheme offered to the dockers, the shipyard workers are getting a very poor deal.<br><br>
Amendment No. 4 will be carried when we vote on it because Conservative Members do not want the redundancy payment scheme stopped. They do not want to see people thrown on the streets without a financial cushion, albeit a cushion with little filling in it. They do not want to see people spending the rest of their lives in that way.<br><br>
At present 51.8 per cent of the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay) are unemployed in the East End ward, and 37.9 percent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
in Thorney Close. I apologise for using percentages. I do not normally do that when talking about unemployed people because unemployed people are not percentages; they are human beings and most of them are the main wage earners in their families. However, I have a leaflet in front of me and I must refer to the percentages.<br><br>
I have spent some considerable time standing in the queue waiting to get unemployment benefit, signing the book with a two and a half inch pencil tied to a 36-inch piece of string, so that it could not be stolen, and getting a paltry amount of money.<br><br>
Human beings are being humiliated. Does any Conservative Member know the humiliation of standing in a dole queue? Labour exchanges are a little more automated and professional now, but years ago when I was on the dole, we went to Victoria road, in Hebburn, stood in the queue and then went to the dole clerk. He said "Sign your name there". There was a pencil hanging on 36 inches of string and we signed the book. He told us to come back on Friday to collect our coppers.<br><br>
At that time the amount that shipyard workers received was £2·7s. 6d a week, which is about £2·37. We will deal with that later in the year—I hope before the summer recess—when we come to clause 2. Hon. Members will then see what the shipbuilding industry was like when it was in private hands.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to extend the scheme for 12 months, but not end it then. I am sorry that the amendment to the long title was not selected. That is no criticism of you, Mr. Shersby, or the Clerks, but we wanted to alter the long title to include the termination of redundancy payments for shipbuilding workers because that is the purpose of the Bill.<br><br>
Conservative Members, particularly the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon), know about unemployment, although not personally. The hon. Gentleman knows that a considerable number of his constituents are on the dole, so he can ask them about it. No doubt when he goes home for his weekly surgeries he walks around the labour exchange talking to the unemployed because he is a very conscientious Member of Parliament. At least, that was in his election literature when he stood in the Darlington by-election and was beaten by Ossie O'Brien. He must have convinced some people in the period preceding the 1983 general election that he was speaking the truth.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will be talking to the unemployed in his constituency about the meagre amount that they receive and about their future in the North, although he does not believe in regional aid. I trust that I am not straying from the amendment, Mr. Shersby; I hoped that the hon. Member for Darlington would intervene to try to put the record straight.<br><br>
The Conservative Party always opposed the nationalisation—or should I say the saving—of the British shipbuilding industry in June 1977. Presumably the Government have now decided to extend the scheme for 18 months, rather than two years or 12 months as before, because they do not like to keep returning to that June date.<br><br>
I am glad that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary is on the Committee because I find him far more receptive than his hon. Friend the Minister of State. He was not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
on the last Shipbuilding Committee, and we have heard him yet on this one, but he cannot be any worse than his hon. Friend.<br><br>
I have had a letter from Mr. Denis Whalen, CSEU secretary of the Hebburn yard, Wagonway road, Hebburn—one of the yards that will be closed. I asked the Prime Minister about it the other day. It is the only remaining shipbuilding establishment in my constituency of Jarrow, which is so famous in the shipbuilding world—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am reluctant to interrupt the hon. Gentleman when he is talking about matters which are so important to him, but the subject of the two amendments that we are discussing is limited to the time to which he has referred. I should be enormously grateful if he would confine his remarks to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Shersby. However, I am talking about the amendment. I am suggesting that the Government should extend the scheme until June 1987 and then extend it further. The people who will be affected are my constituents. Many of them work in the Hebburn yard, which according to the chairman of British Shipbuilders is to be put in mothballs next month.<br><br>
Do the Government want to extend the scheme by 18 rather than 12 months because they want to allow more time for someone to come along and buy the yards cheaply, as happened with Readheads and the Tyne Ship repair Group? Perhaps they want more time because of what happened when the industry was nationalised in 1977, when the warship yards Yarrow, Barrow and Vosper Thornycroft, not satisfied with their compensation, went to the European Court of Human Rights to get it increased. After all the debates on the Floor of the House, as well as two statutory instruments extending the period for 12 months and two years respectively, why do the Government want an extension of 18 months? What is wrong with 12 months or two years?<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Education and Science introduced the word "entrepreneur" some years ago. Are the Government trying to get a boatload of entrepreneurs to come along and regenerate industry? We have been waiting for that for a long time on the river Tyne. Why 18 months—why not 12 months? Are they saying that if we extend it for only 12 months those people may not come—vultures like Shipbuilding Security Limited which used to come round before the war? That was an organisation of merchant banks, shipbuilders and ship owners formed in the 1930s, which came to Jarrow in 1934, bought the whole Jarrow shipyard and closed it.<br><br>
That organisation sold the assets and put a 40-year embargo on Jarrow shipyard building ships. It meant that when the war came in 1939 that restriction had to be lifted. Are the Government trying to re-enact those vultures? Do they want them within the next 12 months or are they saying that they might not be able to re-enact that scenario from the 1930s in 12 months so they need 18 months?<br><br>
As I was saying earlier, when you rightly brought me back to order, Mr. Shersby, I have received a letter from Denis Whalen. He wrote, "Dear Don"—he calls me by my christian name because I used to work with him and I am not one of those Members of Parliament
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
who expect someone to stand to attention and address them as "Sir", "Lord" or "Mister"—
<br><blockquote><p>"Once again shop stewards of the Hebburn Yard have been expressing grave concern over the future of the Hebburn Yard and South Tyneside. The yard is slowly but surely running downhill to the extent that the west yard—Leslies—including the dock and the berths, the only shipbuilding berths on the southside of the river, is virtually closed."</p></blockquote>
That is significant because they are the only shipbuilding berths on the south side of the river Tyne. When the Hebburn yard goes into mothballs next month it will be the first time in living history that no ships will be built on the south side of the river Tyne. We are a maritime nation which depends on trade carried by ships, and the south side of the most famous shipbuilding river in the world is not to build any more ships. That is the result of the Government's policy and that is why many shipyard workers are concerned. We are worried about the speed of the Government's policy, and believe that the period should be 12 months and renewable.<br><br>
Many people are out of work in my area and others will be sacked within the next 12 months—even if the amendment is carried—and given a pittance under the shipbuilding redundancy scheme. In Jarrow 30.5 per cent of the population are out of work, and more men will be added to that dole queue. Even if the amendment is carried and the Government accepts a 12-month or 15-month period with renewal, the position will still be bad—but at least it will be some move in the right direction. One reason why many of the workers have volunteered for redundancy is that they feel that if they do not get a redundancy payment now they will never get it. They are virtually scared into accepting redundancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is voluntary redundancy at the discretion of the management? The restrictive power of management makes us all the more worried about the very short period envisaged. That is why we want a debate before the completion of the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Malone <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Shersby. I cannot hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying. It would be helpful if he could address the Committee, as I am genuinely trying to follow the debate and I am interested in this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) will address the Chair because otherwise it is difficult for hon. Members to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Shersby, and to the Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) mentioned voluntary redundancies. He asked about the 18-month period and why the review could not be done in 12 months. If it is a voluntary scheme, although that is not entirely clear, there will be a great rush, which will be detrimental to all the companies involved. I want to clarify that important point with my hon. Friend before he goes further. A very tight compression of time for completion of the scheme will have a deleterious effect.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Malone) understands Geordie. If he does not I shall explain the matter again, although I cannot use Oxford English.<br><br>
Voluntary means that a worker can volunteer provided that the management wants him to do so. I know of people who have volunteered for redundancy and been told that they will not get it because they are not in the right class. Managements know which people they want to get shot of, so it is voluntary redundancy with the management's OK.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend confirm that there will be a push on management which will be to the detriment of morale and to management's ability to cope with the situation if the final chop is there at the end of the 18 months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly true. People will volunteer because they think that they will lose out. It is like volunteering in the Army. The sergeant would say, "I want volunteers—you, you and you". It is the same in the shipyards. Management want only certain volunteers. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) was in the Army for some time and he understands what it is like to volunteer there. The sergeant would ask, "Are there any musicians in the platoon?" When two soldiers stood forward the sergeant would say, "Well shift the piano out of the NAFFI."<br><br>
The Opposition want the period extended to either 12 months or 15 months so that it can be renewed. We shall debate that on amendment No. 4. I worked in the shipbuilding industry from the age of 14 when I left Ellison Church of England school, Jarrow. It was only an elementary school. Doubtless, when Conservative Members speak, we shall hear that they have been to university.<br><br>
All the time that I worked in the shipyards—much of the time I was a shop steward—we talked about the glorious day when the shipyards would be nationalised and we could get away from the mess that private owners had made of the industry. We used to talk in the fo'c's'le down at the dock bottom and in the double bottoms about the day when the shipbuilding industry would belong to us. We thought that nationalisation meant worker's control. We got a bit of a shock when we realised that all that had been done was to change the name over the gate to "British Shipbuilders", and the same foreman was running the yard who had made a mess of it when it was in the private sector. However, that is something which we hope to change when the Labour party comes to power in 1988 and we give the workers a lot more control over the industry.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is shaking his head. I was under the impression that the Liberal party supported workers' control and workers cooperatives. I thought that it was part of the Liberal philosophy to give the workers a say on the board. I am surprised, and I look forward with interest to what the hon. Gentleman has to say about the extension of 12 months instead of 18 months.<br><br>
The amendments are only minor. We do not intend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
to spend a great deal of time debating them as they are so narrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that in addition to the need to relate his argument to the amendment, it is also desirable not to rehearse arguments at too great a length. I should be grateful if he would bear that in mind. The Committee is debating the specific period of time, and to go over arguments again makes that rather difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that was digressing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. My point is that undue repetition of arguments does not help the Committee to make progress. The Committee is discussing the periods specifically set out in amendments Nos. 2 and 3, and it would be enormously helpful if the hon. Gentleman could confine his remarks to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Shersby. Obviously I have strayed at times, and you are quite right to draw me back to the amendments. They are very narrow amendments and not much time can be spent on them, which is why I have tried wherever possible to keep within their confines. As you rightly say, the main debate will come later and the Committee can get down to the nittygritty—the details of the redundancy scheme and the calculations, which I hope that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will explain before this debate is finished.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 deal with a very important matter. Many men will be made redundant within the next 12 months. That may not be very important to some Committee members, but it is certainly important to those who will be made redundant. I shall leave the matter there and hope that the Minister will answer some of the points that have been raised during this short intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question underlying what the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) has called probing amendments is one which the Secretary of State should be asked to answer. We are concerned about the implications of ending the scheme and the likely effect of that in the near future as privatisation develops and the rundown of these yards continues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is difficult to hear because of the conversations going on in the Committee. I appeal for a quieter atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Shersby. I should have thought that both sides of the Committee would prefer there to be no need for redundancy schemes. They are needed owing to a variety of circumstances, for which one cannot blame any particular Government or group of people.<br><br>
The fact remains that the shipbuilding industry has gone through a period of catastrophic decline, which is still continuing, and the alternatives for workers in the industry are limited or, as the hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) said, non-existent in areas such as his.<br><br>
It is clear, therefore, that the availability of such a scheme is of critical importance to make what is never-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
theless a disaster vaguely bearable and tolerable. I have no difficulty understanding the accent of the hon. Member for Jarrow as my grandfather did his apprenticeship in the very Hebburn yard to which he referred, and it is a matter of very great regret that such yards may be closed for ever. It is important that we recognise the effect of that.<br><br>
In an exchange a few minutes ago, the way in which the redundancy scheme works was rightly brought out. It is, in theory, a voluntary scheme. When there is a finite date which is moving up, it is natural in circumstances such as I have described—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the hon. Gentleman say that it is a voluntary scheme? It really is not voluntary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, that is the very point I was about to make. In what is supposedly a voluntary scheme, in circumstances where the scheme is finite and where the community has no other opportunities, it is inevitable that individuals will seek to look after themselves while a scheme exists. As a result of that, many will come forward, not necessarily because they want the money, not necessarily because they want out of the industry, but because they see that the reality is that they will be pushed out of the industry anyway and if they leave it too long the scheme may not be available.<br><br>
The problem is further compounded if management then says "You can't go, boy, because we need your particular skill". The Under-Secretary should acknowledge that this presents a problem. The management may say that it can keep the core of the workers and the mix that it needs; it has that right of veto. But what effect does it have on the performance of those workers who have applied for redundancy and been told they cannot have it in circumstances where the Government are bringing forward legislation to say that this scheme is due to terminate? The net effect of that will be a considerable lowering of morale and performance for those individuals. To that extent the amendments are at least trying to take some of the pressure off. It would have been better if the Government had not sought to bring down the chopper.<br><br>
If the Government are confident that the industry will reach a level at which employment will be stable, why terminate the scheme? It will not be necessary and will effectively fade away of its own accord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that specific point, it is all the more unnecessary to chop it when we understand that the shipbuilders will continue with exactly the same scheme in the same circumstances and the cost to the Government will be just as it was before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point. In a sense the Government's determination to put a termination on the scheme is likely to aggravate the very problems that we are discussing, namely, the rush to try to get redundancy, a further running-down of morale and a reduction in the efficiency of the industry. It does not seem even to be necessary, so to that extent the thrust behind the amendments is one of which the Government should take account.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
It is true that there is added uncertainty with the privatisation proposals. That causes uncertainty in the individuals who do not know whether they will have a comparable redundancy scheme, if any, in the private sector. If the privatisation process is long drawn out or delayed, there is a further reason why workers within British Shipbuilders should take redundancy.<br><br>
I refer specifically to two Scottish yards, Hall Russell in the constituency of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Malone) and Yarrow on Clydeside, where there is a proposal for a joint buyout of the two yards. However, the workers at the Yarrow yard have voted against it, not because they do not like the workers at Hall Russell, but because they are opposed to privatisation and will not even discuss the options, although—regrettably or not—they will have to accept it for as long as the Government's resolve continues.<br><br>
The problem is compounded by that complication. What was seen by the local community in Aberdeen as a viable deal which was progressing fairly smoothly has been upset by that vote. Another bid involving Mr. kin Sproat, a former Member of Parliament for Aberdeen, South, buying the Hall Russell yard independently has led to more anxiety. While it would not be appropriate to comment on the merits or demerits of the bid or its outcome, it is relevant to the amendment that if such problems persist they will provide an incentive for workers to seek redundancy. They will feel that with more uncertainty in what is already a difficult industry they should get out while the going is good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I spoke to the work force and the shop stewards at Hall Russell I did not find the degree of uncertainty to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. Rather than concentrating on the potential outcome of various bids, they were satisfied that the yard and the work force were viable. Whoever makes a reasonable bid, they will make a go of it. The hon. Gentleman is raising a dangerous red herring in suggesting that there is uncertainty in the work force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but I did not say that there was already uncertainty. I said that the proposal might lead to uncertainty, which could ultimately be damaging. I entirely accept that the yard is viable. It has been successful and profitable in both the private and the public sector. At the risk of distancing myself from other members of the Committee, I am concerned not with whether the yard is private or public but that it should continue to operate viably as a shipyard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, does not the hon. Gentleman agree that reviewing the scheme in 12 or 15 months, as the amendment proposes, would eliminate that element of uncertainty? While we believe that jobs are much more secure in the public sector—indeed, that is shown by productivity rates in British Shipbuilders—does he not accept that the amendment would resolve the problems posed by the chop, would enable us to check on how the order pattern was going and in general would create more secure circumstances for the industry?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. That was my basic argument; I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not see it. As I was saying to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, I recognise the performance and the morale of the Hall Russell yard. But—let me be blunt—a quick sale that settled all the uncertainty would be the best thing for the work force, so that they knew what was happening. Prolonged uncertainty could cause problems and redundancies, and it might be difficult to retain the skill pool.<br><br>
It would be wrong to assume that the skill pool is not important in areas such as Aberdeen. One of our great tragedies is that our traditional manufacturing industries are declining even faster than elsewhere. Grampian region, supposedly the oil-rich area of Britain, was the only region in Scotland whose unemployment increased in the last two months of 1984. It should not be thought that we could simply make skilled people redundant and it would not matter because they would easily be absorbed into the oil industry. The people of Aberdeen feel very strongly that shipbuilding is a key strategic industry in which they have been involved for a long time and which they want to continue.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South will agree that the work force in Hall Russell want it to continue as a viable shipyard. I believe that it will, but unless the Government reconsider, the Bill leaves a possible area of uncertainty which we could do without.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 4 deals with the termination. This amendment deals with the period of time, whether 12 or 15 months. Would the hon. Member not accept that the men from Hall Russell will be no different from the men from Swan Hunter, from Brooke Marine in Lowestoft or, indeed, from Appledore? They treasure their good redundancy scheme under a nationalised industry. If the men in Hall Russell do not accept that they will lose that redundancy scheme and feel that it makes no difference to them, they are the most peculiar shipyard workers I have ever heard of.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister may wish to take up that point. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the British Shipbuilders scheme is good. However, until the new deal has been renegotiated we do not know for certain if there will be a scheme at all, whether good or bad. However, if a scheme is available there is always that temptation to take the money while the going is good. The Government should consider that point.<br><br>
One of the reassurances that we have not yet had from the Government concerns their attitude to the future of the shipping and shipbuilding industries. A core of 9,000 has been hinted at, but it has not been clarified whether that is based upon some assessment of how many yards we shall have over a future period or whether it is a figure, plucked out of the air, through which we pass on the way to zero. That has not been made clear by Ministers. Indeed, none of the statements made by Ministers so far have reassured a demoralised industry. On the contrary, they have tended to add to its demoralisation. It is unhelpful that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Government are bringing forward a Bill which appeared in the first instance to benefit people in the industry but which has a sting in its tail which makes the situation worse than it would be if they had not introduced the Bill or had left it open ended or had left it to a statutory instrument, as the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) suggested in his opening remarks.<br><br>
Although this is a probing amendment and is not being pressed to a division, the Minister should acknowledge the element of uncertainty that is being created which could have a negative effect on an industry which could do without that additional pressure. The Government should demonstrate a slightly more positive attitude to the future of the industry. Their present attitude could not be more negative. There needs to be at least a slight change of heart, some indication that they will show more concern for the future of the industry, for the communities as well as the individuals. An individual may be able to protect himself by opting into the scheme, but if too many do that, the collective effect is that they may be all right in the short term but their community is left without any core for the economy and devastating levels of unemployment.<br><br>
Frankly, and if I am not out of order to say so, the Government need to consider not only the extension of the review and the scheme itself but what they will do for the communities if they offer little or no hope for future employment within the shipbuilding industry. I appreciate that that is a wider issue, but it is one which the Government have to answer sooner rather than later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bob Clay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sunderland, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is about timing. It also tries to discover the Government's intentions for the shipbuilding industry. I am interested in the merchant sector of the industry and I should like to make one or two points about it. The yards in my constituency on the river Wear not much more than 100 years ago launched over half the total world shipping tonnage. Those yards, Sunderland Shipbuilders, Austin and Pickersgill, are in the merchant sector and their future is very precarious. The announcement that the scheme may come to an end at the end of 1986, which would be the case if the Bill were passed unamended, has already caused much apprehension and fear on top of that which already existed.<br><br>
As some hon. Members have said, if the present scheme will not be in existence at the end of 1986, there is a tendency for people to take that to mean that the Government believe that there will be no merchant shipyards within British Shipbuilders by the end of 1986. That is the most common view among shipyard workers in my constituency. They think that the Government are saying that there will not be a merchant shipbuilding industry by the end of 1986 and therefore the redundancy scheme can be terminated by then.<br><br>
If that is the Government's intention, they should not be messing around with a Bill like this. They should come clean so that people know where they are. But if that is not the Government's intention, they should explain the position in which they think the merchant yards will be at the point where the scheme comes to an end at the end of 1986. December 1986 is not that far away.<br><br>
The point has already been made that many shipyard workers feel that if the scheme is coming to an end
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0278">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
they might as well take their redundancy and get out now, rather than wait for a worse scheme some time in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with the problem on which the hon. Gentleman voices anxiety, uncertainty and fears within the shipyards? I hope that Opposition Members will make it clear to their constituents that this is a probing amendment because, on the face of it, it is more hostile than the Opposition are alleging the Government's proposals to be, and it would shorten the time in which the yards could negotiate a successor scheme.<br><br>
Hon. Members therefore compound the uncertainty by saying that under the amendment we wish to give less time to negotiate a successor scheme. It is important, because those who may not be familiar with our ways could read the Opposition amendment in a less charitable manner and, in so doing, might cause even more difficulties within a yard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for making that point. I think that Opposition Members have already made it clear that this is a probing amendment and that our intentions and attitudes will become crystal clear when we reach amendment No. 4</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Garrett<span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for his statement. What we say in this Committee is reported in newspapers such as the <i>Financial Times,</i> which is read throughout the world in which we actually have to work to obtain our orders. Hon. Members who do not read the <i>Financial Times</i> every day should start reading it and study its impact on the English-speaking world, especially in the manufacturing areas where we depend on shipbuilding orders.<br><br>
I submit that the mere fact that the Bill has been introduced has set the alarm bells ringing in the countries where it is possible to obtain orders. I hope that the Minister will not chide my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay) for being unduly alarmist, because there is some degree of alarm now. That is why I am worried about those who will still be in the yards after the redundancy payments have been made to the few thousand who will go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point.<br><br>
The Minister seemed to be saying that what is being done is bad enough, but if people took the amendment seriously, it would make matters even worse. He seemed to be saying, "Please don't give people the impression that you are saying that the scheme should come to an end in June or October 1986 rather than December 1986, because that makes things even worse than they would be if they were done in our way". That is an interesting admission, I think, that the Minister understands the effect of the Government's proposal on morale in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greg Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have tabled an amendment, and Conservative Members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
would like to hear the case for supporting it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite simple. If the amendment was accepted, and if amendment No. 4 was also accepted we would be back to having an annual renewal of the scheme in June, and we could have another debate before June 1986 to review the situation in the industry and consider what should happen to the redundancy scheme. That would be the same as what has happened in previous years, and there would be no reason for shipyard workers to fear that the Bill would bring various parts of British shipbuilding to an end.<br><br>
Before the Minister's speech on Second Reading, many shipyard workers believed that that would happen, that for some reason the scheme was being extended for another year and a half, and after that could be extended again and again. It was not until Second Reading that it became clear that the scheme was to be terminated. That caused a great deal of concern in shipbuilding communities.<br><br>
It is not only a case of workers in the industry saying to themselves, "I might as well get out now if there is no future in the industry". Some Conservative Members may think that the end of 1986 is a long way off, that a few things will happen in the industry before then, and that panic applications for so-called voluntary redundancy will not be made until shortly before December 1986. That is not the case. The Committee has already discussed the extent to which the scheme is voluntary, and it has already been recognised that in many cases shipyard workers apply for redundancy, for one reason or another, but are not granted it.<br><br>
In certain shipyards, even though the vast majority of the work force are determined to keep their jobs and that their shipyard should stay open and succeed, there is a minority of workers who feel demoralised. They feel that there is no future or, for personal or other reasons, that the time has come for them to leave the industry. Such people are very often not allowed to leave because redundancies are not required in their particular trade or at that particular time.<br><br>
In some cases—I am sure that many hon. Members have come across this—an individual may have applied several times for redundancy which has not been granted. Only a small minority of people get into that position, but everyone in a shipyard knows about such cases, and of cases where it has taken someone a year or a year and a half to get redundancy. If shipyard workers know that the scheme will end in 1986, the logical step to make sure that they get their lot before then is to apply now. That is the conclusion which some people will draw from this measure, and it would be absolutely disastrous.<br><br>
Redundancy is a morbid obsession in the shipyards—in my constituency certainly—that has built up over the past year or two. It is all that people in the yards are thinking about now one way or another. They either fear redundancy or they wish to have redundancy in order to end the fear, they worry about what the future of the yard is, what the core work force will be and whether the yard will stay open at all. Everyone's thoughts and daily conversations and the whole question of industrial relations in the yard are now revolving around those issues. It is a horrid, morbid situation, and the Bill will make it 10 times worse unless the amendments are passed.</span></p>

<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One reason why we have tabled the amendment is to find out why the Government have swayed from their previous statutory instrument. The Bill on redundancy payments was introduced in 1978. It was retrospective to 1977 and took us to 1979, when it was extended for a further two years. In 1981 it was extended for a further two years and in 1983 for yet a further two years until June this year. Why should they suddenly decide to extend it for 18 months? Is it so that they can shed the labour so that the buyers can move in sooner?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cary</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I have already pointed out how people will react to the Bill if they assume that their yard is about to close. Another assumption common among many workers at Austin and Pickersgill in my constituency is that the yard may not actually close, but when it has finally run out of work and has gone through a crisis period it can be sold cheaply or given away. A buyer will suddenly emerge for one of the most modern, well-equipped yards in Europe. No sooner will it have been bought for a song than the orders will start appearing.<br><br>
The Ethiopian order may suddenly be sewn up and finalised at that time together with one or two of the other orders that have been pursued over the last year. There is a fear that that will happen, and because it has been made clear that once a yard is privatised the scheme will not apply, people may again assume that it will be in private ownership—if it is open at all—at the end of 1986. As my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) has pointed out, that is the only explanation we can draw from cutting six months off the extension of the scheme and ending it there.<br><br>
The Government must explain the reason for an 18-month extension. Is it the assumption that merchant shipbuilding will be finished altogether in this country by the end of 1986? So far they have not recognised that assumption. Alternatively, is it the assumption that all merchant yards will be in private ownership by the end of 1986? A third assumption is that what is left of merchant shipbuilding in British Shipbuilders will be in such a healthy position with full orderbooks and so on that there will no longer be any need to have a redundancy scheme. If it is the third assumption, there is still no need to scrap the scheme. The scheme can be kept, but nobody will need to apply because the industry will be in a healthy state with a glowing future.<br><br>
If that is the Government's assumption, it is the first time we have heard about it in recent debates and public pronouncements, and it is certainly not the view of the chairman of the industry, Mr. Graham Day, or any of his colleagues. He has come to many meetings with various Opposition Members and he has continually told us a very depressing tale which certainly does not include the notion that the industry will be in a healthy state by the end of 1986.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not find it a coincidence if Mr. Graham Day's contract were to finish in 18 months' time? If there is an extension when Ins contract finishes, no shipbuilding industry will be left and he will have done his job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be a remarkable display of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
intuition by my hon. Friend. It could happen.<br><br>
The Government must tell us which of the three reasons is the right one. It is a pity that the Minister is not here to give us the answer. Why have six months been taken off what should have been a two-year extension, and why does the scheme terminate at the end of 1986? Does the Minister assume that there will be no merchant shipbuilding industry by them or that all merchant yards will be in private hands? Or does he assume that the merchant shipbuilding industry will be within British Shipbuilders, but will be so healthy that no redundancy scheme will be needed?<br><br>
If one of those reasons does not lie behind the time period, what is the purpose of it? We cannot see any other reason for it. Unless an explanation is forthcoming, the logical solution is not to terminate the scheme, but to renew it for one year or 15 months. That would leave the option for a further debate, another Bill and a further renewal at the end of that period.<br><br>
Shipbuilding is unlike other industries in which a redundancy scheme can be terminated cleanly at a particular time. There is a long process of securing orders, signing the contract and cutting steel before the ship is eventually launched, outfitted and seatrialled. Many shipyards have been negotiating orders for a year on, longer, without yet having secured them.<br><br>
What effect will that have on potential owners by the end of 1986? Let us suppose that a potential owner is negotiating a contract with British Shipbuilders and sees that there are hundreds of speculative voluntary redundancy applications in a yard, because the workers think that the scheme is coming to an end, that there is no future in the industry and that they should move. That will not give him enough confidence to place an order with that yard. He will wonder whether there will be a work force left to build the ships. Employees will not want to leave the industry and to be out of work, but they will make applications believing that they will eventually be made redundant anyway, and that they should leave while the scheme still exists. But many owners, particularly those from abroad, will not necessarily understand that crucial point. They will believe that the yards do not have the will to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not being in the Committee throughout his remarks.<br><br>
The problem has already been faced in Scotland at Scott Lithgow, where the work force was successfully transferred in difficult circumstances involving redundancy. It was possible for the purchaser of that yard to negotiate satisfactorily with British Shipbuilders. I cannot see why the hon. Gentleman should suggest that that should pose a problem. The achievement at Scott Lithgow can surely be achieved elsewhere in the shipbuilding industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. We could debate what happened at Scott Lithgow for the next few days. The Minister made clear on Second Reading that special conditions were allowed to apply which we think might not be unconnected with the identity of the buyer. Trafalgar House is a generous donor to Conservative party funds—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. the debate is going too wide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0280">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
of the amendments. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to confine his remarks to the period specified in them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was replying to a specific and important point about Scott Lithgow, but I shall try to relate it to the amendment.<br><br>
If what happened at Scott Lithgow is reassuring for shipyard workers and there is no need to pass the amendments, because after December 1986 some generous alternative option will apply, it would be only logical for the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Malone) to put down an amendment specifying that conditions as generous as those that applied to Scott Lithgow workers should apply to all British Shipbuilders' employees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had the time period applied, there would have been a considerable difference between Scott Lithgow, which had a £100 million oil rig in the yard which the men could occupy, and a shipyard with only a £100,000 barge. When it comes to negotiating with a future employer, a shipyard with a £100 million oil rig is far stronger than a shipyard with nothing on the berth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Conservative Members might say that my hon. Friend had made a cynical point, but I think that he is quite right. Are we to assume that the Government would have made exactly the same arrangements if a £100 million rig had not been in the yard and the shop stewards had had no bargaining power? If Conservative Members are telling us straightfaced and seriously that that bargaining power had nothing to do with the final outcome, they can prove it by putting down an amendment under which every employee of British Shipbuilders will have the same options at the end of 1986 as those of Scott Lithgow. I do not believe that such an amendment will be forthcoming.<br><br>
I have tried to speak directly to the amendment, and to explain why the timing of the proposals is particularly unfortunate. Yards in my constituency are running out of work programmes. Austin and Pickersgill is now faced with a real possibility of closure. I do not want to say too much about that, but it is relevant to the Bill.<br><br>
Only one or two potential orders could secure the future of the yard, and even if they turn up in the next few days—they will have to if the yard is to stay open—they will provide only another six or nine months' work, taking us to the end of the year. The workers will be asking, "What happens after that? Will we have to go through all this again when we know that the redundancy scheme will finish at the end of 1986, suggesting that the Government intend either to let us close or to privatise us next year?"<br><br>
There is tremendous confusion, doubt and tension as shipyards struggle desperately to obtain orders and to retain a balanced work force in the present depressing atmosphere. They have had no Government assistance for several years. That is why the amendment is crucial. It gives the Government the opportunity to tell us their real intentions, to tell us the significance of 18 months and to tell us why they do not allow the scheme to be renewed again.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will answer my questions. Is it because shipbuilding will be privatised by the end of 1986? Is it because it will all have gone by the end of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
1986? Is it because the industry will have recovered to such a state that the scheme is not needed? If the latter is the case, why not keep the scheme anyway? If the industry is in a healthy state and people do not want to be made redundant, it will not cost the Government any money because nobody will apply for it.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Garrett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee may be interested to know that I was involved in the marathon Committee stage of the Bill which nationalised the shipbuilding and aircraft industry. Shortly afterwards we had our first redundancy payments legislation for shipbuilding. Even when we were going through that Bill, it was clear that the situation was worsening in the British shipbuilding industry. Even when we had the first redundancy payments legislation the position was worsening. We are now at a stage of utter desperation.<br><br>
There can be no political arguments at this stage about the problems related to the industry. We have gone through the private sector into the state sector and, if there is anything left, it is likely to go back into the private sector. I think that the case stated by the Opposition this morning is sufficiently strong and has been enlarged sufficiently to impress upon the Minister the need for an extension of the period to see whether we can take the industry out of the political limelight and try to keep it in the commercial field in order to retrieve some orders which are still available in parts of this planet.<br><br>
I want the Minister to consider three propositions, and I am also seeking the support of his colleagues in other Departments who will have departmental responsibility. We have so far kept to the actual cash payments, but for some time, in addition to redundancy payments in other industries, some form of social responsibility has been emerging.<br><br>
The National Coal Board has given £10 million—if it still lies on the table in view of the problems in that industry—for retraining processes. ICI was the first major company to introduce a redundancy payments scheme in the late 1950s, early 1960s. The Committee may be interested to know that the 1965 redundancy payments scheme was based on ICI's original scheme. ICI put its social input into the redundancies. Funds are still made available for retraining while redundancy is impending or before the actual redundancy payment is made to the employee.<br><br>
A third recent example is British American Tobacco which, because of the decline in cigarette smoking, had to face up to the reality that certain parts of the establishments in the Liverpool and Merseyside area would have to be closed down or suffer a reduction in the work force. It put something into an organisation, and that should please Conservative Members, because it encouraged the establishment of small businesses. Small business people were given professional advice not only by the experts of British American Tobacco but by experts whom the company brought in. The scheme has been relatively successful. I shall not digress but I recommend the study of that scheme.<br><br>
British Shipbuilders has no social input to the areas where shipbuilding is established. If we sought an extension of the scheme it might allow the Minister to canvas some support for his right hon. and hon. Friends. The most dreadful aspect of redundancy has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
already been described. However, there is another factor. Because of the monetary pressures in the shipbuilding industry some of the training facilities have been closed down. Some young people have been unable to conclude satisfactorily an apprenticeship that would allow them to establish a base elsewhere.<br><br>
Given the good will that would exist there could be some training schemes before redundancy takes place. A welder, for example, could be trained to drive. If he already has a driving licence he could be trained to drive heavy goods vehicles. If British Shipbuilders were given some encouragement by the Government it would consider that as social input. That would also help to allay the fears, which others have expressed more forcibly than I, that the Government are still distancing themselves too far from our manufacturing base.<br><br>
Certain Government supporters feel that the time has come—they have stated this publicly—for a much closer link between Government and industry whether in the public or private sector. It is wrong to leave everything to free market forces. There has to be a more pragmatic approach. I hate to use that phrase because Harold Wilson, now Lord Wilson, invented it and so I tend to avoid it.<br><br>
It is wrong to give redundancy payments to the men yet at the same time close the skillcentres. There is a lack of cohesion. After the debate the Minister should consult with his advisers to ascertain whether a formula can be established to enable the work force to have the chance to compete in a limited labour market for whatever jobs become available. If the worst comes to the worst and they have to leave their areas of high unemployment, when they go to areas of full employment such as Romford—I see the hon. Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert) opposite me—they will at least be able to compete on equal terms. I am not putting the case very clearly, but I hope that my basic point is understood—there should be a humanitarian input.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend talks about retraining. Retraining is important if one is talking about a dying industry. But as he knows, the shipbuilding industry is not dying. Shipyard workers do not gain their experience out of a book, unlike Members of Parliament who can learn what to say and how to say it from a book. Shipbuilding is learned by experience. That experience is going to be laid aside and the skill to build ships will be lost. During the Falklands dispute, the men who had been sacked 12 months previously were brought back into the yards and worked 12-hour shifts. That happened before the war too. The men who were sacked in 1934 were brought back into the industry in 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It certainly is not a dying industry when one considers not only the manual skills but the highly technical skills and the men who—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying wide of the amendment once again. Will the hon. Gentleman keep to the point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your guidance, Mr. Shersby. This point has been made by my hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay). We must decide how to overcome the uncertainty among the work force who think that they may miss the redundancy payments to which everyone in the industry feels entitled. We must find a way that does not prejudice their payment, and which will allow them some financial recompense for being forced to stay on. Many people will then stay on in the vital period before the next shipbuilding order comes to the region.<br><br>
If the Minister studies other redundancy payment schemes, he will find that some eliminate the problem. Such an arrangement would give confidence to the person who feels threatened. It is essential, as my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) says, to keep up morale. It would retain the required output and allow an increase in output if the orders appeared. I have a well-researched document, which I will pass to the Minister. It mentions several countries and the orders that might come from them. The Minister's advisers would welcome the information and it might urge them to press on British Shipbuilders a more positive approach to potential orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to Opposition Members this morning. The speech of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), to paraphrase F. E. Smith, left me neither wiser nor better informed. It is clear that the crisis in the shipbuilding industry extends to the Opposition Front Bench.<br><br>
However, I was greatly impressed by the sincerity of the hon. Member for Jarrow, (Mr. Dixon), who said several times how keen the Opposition were that amendment No. 2 be accepted by the Government. I am delighted to inform him that several Conservative Members are just as anxious as he is for the amendment to be adopted. When the Opposition press the amendment to a vote, we may be delighted to support them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may remember that I suggested that amendment No. 2 should be carried with amendment No. 4 so that the matter could be reviewed. Therefore, if Conservative Members intend to vote once, they should vote twice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to do such deals in public. The hon. Gentleman should see me through the usual channels. We should consider the costs of the scheme. The period for which it is available is also relevant. Since nationalisation in 1977, 35,000 redundant workers in the shipbuilding industry have benefited under the scheme, and £130 million of public money has been devoted to them. In addition, 7,000 individuals are in receipt of the weekly benefits provided under the scheme.<br><br>
I represent a constituency which once had shipbuilding yards, although that was many years ago. But we have industries experiencing the problems of decline and redundancy. ICI, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett), employs a considerable number of people in mid-Cheshire. Since 1979 —a date which I just pluck out of the air—about 10,000 ICI workers have been made redundant and have benefited from the private scheme to which the hon. Gentle-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
man referred. But such schemes are nowhere near as generous as those provided for shipbuilding workers and for workers in the other declining nationalised industries.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
It is relevant to point out the comparison between the treatment of redundant workers in nationalised industries and those in private industry. Many of my constituents wonder why schemes such as this do not extend to them.<br><br>
In debates on the Shipbuilding (Redundancy Payments) Bill in 1978, when the Conservative party was in Opposition, my hon. Friend the present Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry, who was then shadow spokesman—happily he has now been translated into a substantial spokesman for the Government —made a point to the then Minister of State, Department of industry, the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman). My hon. Friend asked:
<br><blockquote><p>"is it not worth considering whether the scheme proposed in the Bill should not have been an industry-wide scheme rather than confined to British Shipbuilders?"</p></blockquote>
He pointed out the precedent and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not want to make that a definite proposal, but the Government should consider it."</p></blockquote>
His reason for making the point was that
<br><blockquote><p>"there is some concern in the small private sector—the small number of private ship repairers left—that the terms of the Bill will have an adverse effect on them because they, too, need to slim their work forces and might need to negotiate with the unions and buy out their members. Such firms will be faced with a situation in which the unions in the public sector will have got a particular level of benefit, and the small ship repairers, and even the few privately owned shipbuilders, might find those terms very onerous." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 16 January 1978; Vol. 960, c. 184-185.]</p></blockquote>
I must tell my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that the position has not changed in the six years since those statements were made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is as well to remember when making comparisons with ICI's redundancy scheme, that there is a link between pension payments to ICI employees and redundancy schemes. The generosity of the ICI scheme, compared with the pension schemes available in British Shipbuilders, such as they are, alters the balance. I should not be allowed to give details of that link this morning, but a plumber of whatever age declared redundant by ICI would be infinitely better off than one declared redundant by British Shipbuilders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you would agree, Mr. Shersby, that if I were to be drawn into the details arising out of that intervention, I should be out of order, and I have no desire to be so. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but the big difference between an employee in British Shipbuilders and one in ICI is that the ICI employee contributes towards the scheme, while the BS employee does not.<br><br>
I do not advocate more public expenditure by the extension of these schemes to the private sector. That is why I am speaking to this amendment, which might tighten up the scheme which the Government propose to extend. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
devote some time to comparing the redundancy prospects of a worker in the private sector with those of a worker in the public sector. Why do we continue year after year to extend the unfairness in regard to the private sector?<br><br>
I should like a shorter time limit for the extension of the scheme. When it was first introduced, it was intended to last for two years. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) told us that
<br><blockquote><p>"the scheme will operate only for a limited time—two years in the first instance." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 16 January 1978; Vol. 960, c. 176.]</p></blockquote>
It was then extended for a further two years, and then for a further two. It is now being extended for another 18 months.<br><br>
Admittedly, my hon. Friend the Member the Minister of State said on Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have concluded that it should be extended only this one, last, time to the end of 1986." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; Vol. 70, c. 793.]</p></blockquote>
But, despite what Opposition Members have said about the wording, there is no guarantee that we shall not be back again in less than 18 months to extend the period again. As with so many aspects of the Government's policy, I feel that the time has come for us to stand firm.<br><br>
When the right hon. Member for Gorton introduced the scheme, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are seeking to deal with a special situation".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 16 January 1978; Vol. 960, c. 176.]</p></blockquote>
We seem to have had a special situation for seven years, and I wonder when it will be converted into a general situation. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what coefficient we can apply so that we know when the transformation will take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman considered that if the Government were not selling off warship yards and consequently forgoing the revenue accruing from those yards in British Shipbuilders, they might be able to finance an extension of the redundancy scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not consider it right for workers in one section of the industry to cross-subsidise those in another section. If the subsidy is to be applied, it should be applied out of the consolidated fund, and the cost should fall on those who are best able to bear it under our taxation system.<br><br>
There are three reasons for reducing the period by the six months suggested by the Opposition. First, privatisation is under way in the industry, and the sale of three yards—Brooke Marine in Lowestoft, Yarrow on the Clyde and Hall Russell in Aberdeen—has already been announced. Page 8 of British Shipbuilders' annual report and accounts for 1983 states that the corporation is planning to privatise its warship-building. interests. It is receiving full co-operation, and 31 March 1986 has been set as the final date for completion of the privatisation programme. I cannot see why we need to extend the scheme for nine months beyond that date.<br><br>
There should certainly be enough time to negotiate successor schemes for the parts of the industry which will be privatised. As part and parcel of that, we should try to ensure that the parts which will be left in the nationalised sector can finance the schemes themselves. Of course that would involve Government expenditure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0283">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
as well, and might simply shift expenditure from one head to another. Nevertheless, an important principle is enshrined.<br><br>
The last reason which I adduce for not extending the time period more than is necessary relates to the redundancy prospects in the industry. Ministers have said that they see no reason why there should be further large-scale redundancies. Consequently, and as the Opposition have also been keen to point out this morning, the industry in its more efficient, slimmed-down state will have a secure and prosperous future, as long as there is no nonsense of the sort that took place at the Cammell Laird shipyard to ruin the reputation of a particular yard.<br><br>
The Minister should give firm consideration to the intelligent observations of Opposition Members this morning in support of their amendment. We look forward to their pressing the amendment to a vote, and I shall join them in that enterprise with considerable delight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the points which have been raised, not least because I think it is timely for me to interpose myself between the unnerving alliance between the hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) and my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), which is apparently in danger of emerging as a result of that recent exchange. I am sure that both sides of the Committee have appreciated that this is a probing amendment, and not designed to cause alarm and despondency amongst those who may feel that one day they may be affected by the provisions of the SRPS.<br><br>
Before replying to the substantive point, I shall deal with one or two quasi-administrative details and one or two points of fact.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) came close to implying that the Government had not been assiduous in giving proper notice and observing the proper procedures within the usual timetable as one should when bringing legislation before the House. I am bound to point out that a private notice question was brought forward before Christmas dealing with the introduction of this proposal. There was a question on 18 December, and before Christmas the First Reading was notified in the usual way.<br><br>
Where the hon. Gentleman does have a point, which I readily concede, is that owing to a mix-up at the printers, the number of copies of the Bill required to be available for all concerned was not in the appropriate volume at the time he may have required one. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that the Government implied no discourtesy in that respect.<br><br>
I shall deal later with the negotiation of successor schemes and why the Government have chosen the timetable which my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton and several other hon. Members have questioned. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said on Second Reading, there is no reason why the conditions of the successor schemes which may be negotiated on behalf of those who remain employers of British Shipbuilders should not be as generous, albeit non-statutory, as the conditions which now pertain. The private sector companies, of course, are free to negotiate whatever deals they wish.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. I had not realised that the Minister would reach it so soon. I do not want to pre-empt the major debate on amendment No. 4, which raises the whole issue that will now take place at the next Committee sitting.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, at this stage there is no need to worry that the work forces may end up worse off." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; Vol. 70, c. 793.] </p></blockquote>
That is as near a firm commitment as I think anyone could give. Is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary backing away from that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to get involved in an argument about semantics. It was made very clear on Second Reading that my hon. Friend the Minister had written to British Shipbuilders and to Harland and Wolff asking them to deliver the details of the successor scheme within an appropriate period. Having done that, he saw no reason why the scheme should not be as generous as the current scheme. But he is in no position to guarantee that, nor can he stipulate it. I think that the Committee is fairly clear about that.<br><br>
Hon. Members asked whether the scheme should have been left open to extension. The answer is "No". After the first extension from 1979 to 1981, primary legislation was needed. There is no difference this time. Parliament may always extend the measure if it wanted to, but we have said very clearly that this Government have no intention of introducing a further Bill to continue the scheme in its current form.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
On a small point, which is none the less important to those who may observe the record in Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) was wrong when he said that the Harland and Wolff scheme was better than that of British Shipbuilders. The schemes are identical in every respect. That ought to be placed on the record.<br><br>
It was asked whether the warship yards would really be sold by March 1986. Again, it is the Government's firm intention to bring that about, although 1 cannot give my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton a guarantee of that timetable, and I see no reason why in the current state of the market that should not be a reasonable and achievable objective.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Jarrow asked whether there would be an opportunity to debate the fine details of the workings of the scheme—subject to your discretion, Mr. Shersby. The proposed scheme is identical to the scheme which originated with the hon. Gentleman's Administration. The calculation of benefits on, for example, the length of service and the age of the person who takes advantage of the offer which the management make, and the formula for calculating the weekly support payments, are the same in both schemes.<br><br>
Hon. Members may wish to discuss that in detail, but I am sure that many hon. Members who have been involved in the shipbuilding industry for a long time, particularly Opposition Members, feel that there is really no need to discuss the same topic that has been discussed four or five times already. However, if it will help the Committee, I am quite prepared to place

details of the scheme before it so that we may all remind ourselves of how the benefits are calculated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee to have at least a summary of the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the Bill makes no change in the scheme, it would be in order for the Committee only to refer to the details in passing at a later date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance on that, Mr. Shersby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been alterations, and I was referring to the upper limit at which calculations are made. In 1981, when the statutory instrument was produced, the upper limit was raised from £100 to £120 per week. For those who lost their jobs because of the closed shop, under clause 1 of the 1982 Employment Act 1982, the limit was raised from £145 to £154. If that was good enough for the legislation which the present Secretary of State for Trade and Industry introduced when he was Secretary of State for Employment, I am sure that it is good enough for this legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the best thing to do—subject to your guidance, Mr. Shersby—would be to make available the precise methods used for calculation of the upper limit, whether they are based on a 1981 or a 1982 figure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) homed in on a question which a number of hon. Members asked. He asked about the men who wished to apply for redundancy and their position with respect to the managements' decision to ask or not to ask for redundancy.<br><br>
The situation is exactly as the hon. Gentleman understands it to be. First of all it is the management who must call for redundancies and the appropriate structure and format for the preservation or the continuing success of their business. Only when the worker is in that category which allows him to be approached can he decide to opt for the scheme. No member of the work force can opt for the scheme outside the framework against which the management's call for redundancy is being placed. If he is outside those categories, he has a difficulty in that he cannot simply say, "I want to take the money".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but will the Minister explain the problem of a worker who is turned down in those circumstances and who, perhaps in three or four years' time, is made compulsorily redundant when there is no comparable scheme to the one he wished to opt into?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can discuss that later in our debates. We shall have to examine a number of circumstances, not many of which can be pre-ordained today. If that worker has gone to work in what is now a privatised shipyard, the scheme pertaining will be the one that is negotiated between the unions and the management of that new private sector employer. If he works in a yard after 1986 which remains within British Shipbuilders ownership, it too, we hope,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
will have in place a successor to this scheme. If he moves from the public to the private sector, as the hon. Gentleman will know, one or two flexibile arrangements can exist between British Shipbuilders and the new owner. If necessary I should like to deal with some of those at a later stage.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman need not fear that workers, who after 1986 are either in the private sector or in the post-1986 regime public sector, will be bushwhacked or surprised by some draconian reduction in the provision made for them. It will be entirely a matter for the new employers or British Shipbuilders itself after 1986 to put together whatever package is agreeable to the unions and which serves the interests of the company or British Shipbuilders best.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dixon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will come to this on Tuesday. I give him notice that I intend to raise the matter of the payments that were made to Tyne Shiprepairers. I met the directors of Tyne Ship-repairers when they were still working for British Shipbuilders. They informed me that the Government told them that the lump sum that was given to the workers to buy off their shipbuilding redundancy pay was not negotiable with their unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for the courtesy of providing me with notice of that question. As he will know, a number of controversial assertions have been made about that operation. In the first part of what may be a riposte at a later stage, I point out that a criticism can be made from the private sector by those who have to compete with that yard. The transitional arrangements and the arrangements made between British Shipbuilders and the successor company were so generous that it gave that yard a competitive edge which the private shipbuilders bitterly resented. That is a debate for another occasion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) made a contribution in line with his earlier concerns in other debates about the welfare of those who are the casualties of restructuring particularly young people and apprentices who may be left high and dry. I hope that he will concede that British Shipbuilders has been very responsible wherever a yard has been struck by these tragic circumstances. It has tried to see that the apprentices who are already in training get the chance to complete that training either on an alternative site or with a nearby employer or that it makes some arrangement whereby they can complete their qualification.<br><br>
With regard to the systematic arrangements hinted at by the hon. Gentleman for providing support into those communities, there is the huge bonus, even after recent announcements, that regional policy has brought shipbuilding areas. Some say that it has had a mixed effect, but in terms of social responsibility, it has been a recognition of some of the arguments put forward by the hon. Gentleman. There are no systematic arrangements, although there are Government measures for supporting small firms, retraining and regional support, including finance specifically provided by the European Community for areas affected by shipbuilding redundancies. None the less, in disposing of surplus assets and property, BS has favoured buyers best able to ease local unemployment problems. It also makes

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
available financial advice on how redundancy lump sums should be productively invested.<br><br>
I take as my starting point in this morning's substantive debate the comment made on Second Reading by my hon. Friend the Minister of State. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"By the end of 1986 the state will own less than one third of the United Kingdom industry. Moreover, if it is to survive, the remaining merchant shipbuilding sector will by then have had to fight its way back to a competitive position and to have found a level of reasonable stability. The need and justification for the scheme will thus have passed".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; Vol. 70, c. 793.] </p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay) gave three explanations of what he considered was the Government's motivation. The first two were horrific, entirely unfounded and, indeed, unnecessary. He said that there would be no merchant shipping industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend extends his apologies for not being here, but he had to meet some constituents. I believe on a shipbuilding matter. We do not have a scheme for ensuring that we have a merchant ship industry come 1986, and I hope that the Minister will address himself seriously to the question, even though my hon. Friend is not present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I should even address myself to the question. It was a foolish assertion and I do not think that even the hon. Gentleman, for whom I have considerable respect—we have had meetings in Victoria street and in the House—seriously believes that we shall have no merchant shipbuilding industry at the end of 1986, although I know that he is serious in defence of his constituents.<br><br>
In the corporate plan, the chairman of BS is proposing a capacity of about 200,000 compensating gross registered tonnes in those yards. That does not come anywhere near to showing that there will be a huge erosion of merchant shipbuilding capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the plan here and I am well acquainted with its contents. Unfortunately, perhaps unlike the Under-Secretary, I have seen plans go badly awry. We already have a decision to cut the time by six months. It could have gone on for two years. It does not seem as though the Government are in any hurry to extend the arrangements or their commitment to the industry. What might happen in 18 months? Why can we not have the reviews within 12 months? Why have the Government set so tight a timetable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can reply to the debate instead of indulging in what appears to be Question Time. I might then come to the point that the hon. Member wishes me to answer. The Government hope that there will be no need for a statutory scheme, and that the industry will be able to consolidate on the manning levels pertaining in, say, autumn 1986 and that, therefore, a voluntary scheme should be appropriate, with fair fewer redundancies. In other words, we are by no means as pessimistic as some Opposition Members, who I feel occasionally overplay their pessimism and therefore do not enhance the order-taking capability of British Shipbuilders or private sector yards. I fully appreciate that Labour Members must be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
concerned for their constituents' welfare but I wish that occasionally they would accentuate the positive, in the interest of securing more business for domestic shipbuilders.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the Minister would use the word "realism" rather than "pessimism". I am sick to death of the great number of shipbuilding debates which I have to participate in; I wish that I could use my time, skills and talents on other subjects. Nevertheless, these matters come before the House because of the great problems facing the industry. It may be thought that one or two members of the Committee—perhaps including my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay)—are being unduly pessimistic, but it might well be that it is justified in relation to their constituencies. As I said, the appropriate word is "reality"; perhaps the Minister should refrain from speaking about pessimism, and try to impress on the nation the real problems facing the shipbuilding industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is time to get down to basics. Different interpretations may be made on whether the scheme implies a pessimistic or optimistic view of the industry. It could justifiably be argued that the Government see no need for a statutory scheme after the period in question, and that the industry will be consolidated and put on a healthier footing and in a position to attack that 200,000 CGRT figure which is enshrined in the corporate plan. I may legitimately point out that our assumptions are more optimistic than, apparently, those of Opposition Members. Nevertheless, I agree that the industry has had a very tough time and is still suffering from the world recession in shipbuilding orders; of course we also have to be realists.<br><br>
As was made clear on Second Reading, British Shipbuilders and Harland and Wolff are to be asked to make their own redundancy arrangements to replace the SRPS. Those negotiations will impinge heavily on both management and union time, which until March 1986 could largely be devoted to privatisation issues. In addition, the detailed provisions of the scheme means that the date of redundancy for the purposes of the scheme is ordinarily—provided that the employee has worked at the yard for 12 years or more—three months later than the date on which the worker is declared redundant and either dismissed or given notice of dismissal. If the scheme is extended to December 1986, the replacement schemes will need to be agreed by September 1986. Failing that, workers will be subject to uncertainty about their benefits if they are made redundant between October and December 1986.<br><br>
The three-month delay—the trigger mechanism operated under the scheme which has not been mentioned so far in this debate, but which I am sure the hon. Member for Jarrow understand—is significant. We do not want people left high and dry in that period. The amendments would bring forward the period of uncertainty to April 1986 and July 1986 respectively. Furthermore, they would enhance the risk that negotiations may still be in progress and there could be a gap in which no provision is available.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We made it clear that we would not press the amendment to a vote. We made it clear that they were probing amendments and not wrecking amendments. We do not understand why the two years have been cut to 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my opening remarks I pointed out that we felt, taking into account the time table for privatisation, the way in which corporate management time will be exercised during that period and the anniversary or the end of the current arrangements, that our timetable satisfied the need to be helpful to the management and the unions in negotiating their scheme and the need to give the greatest degree of security to those who are currently eligible for benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the whole of the time will be devoted either to privatising the yards or to negotiating redundancy schemes. It seems that no one will be running the business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the debate and have considered the arguments deployed by hon. Members. There seems to be agreement that the amendments should not be pressed to a vote or, indeed—carried. They were legitimate probing amendments. However, there are ways and ways of probing. It may have been a little less difficult for us to debate the amendments had they been put in a different manner. Nevertheless, I advise my hon. Friends and Opposition Members not to press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Probing amendments do not probe in any particular direction. They open up the opportunity to probe the intentions of the Government. I start with the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). I cannot make up for any congenital lack of intellectual apparatus he may have: nothing will make him any wiser. No one will make him more informed because he wants to remain ill-informed. Earlier—I shall read it out if there is any hope of it sinking in—I made it clear that it was not a wrecking amendment but a probing amendment and that we would not press it to a vote. If the only thing to emerge from that is the hon. Member for Tatton wanting to vote on it further to do down the shipbuilding industry that just about sums him up. It sums up the other monetarists and market force theoreticians who seem to have taken over the once liberal-minded Tory party. I refer the hon. Member for Tatton to the speech that Lord Stockton made yesterday in the House of Lords. It makes educative reading, but it would be a waste of time because he would not understand that either.<br><br>
We shall come to amendment No. 4. I agree with you, Mr. Shersby, and the Minister that that is a substantive debate. That takes us to the two issues. First why is the scheme being chopped at all? Clearly we do not expect to carry the day because Conservative Members will toe the party line despite the damage it will do to the shipbuilding industry. That includes even those who have the shipbuilding industry at heart, and I believe that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Malone) is one of those. We are realists about not carrying the day just as the Minister is not a realist about the shipbuilding industry.<br><br>
The Minister says that we shall have a strong,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
competitive, expanding, commercial sector. He forgets that a constituency near his—about which he and I know a great deal—once had 70 per cent of the motor cycle industry. It dominated world markets and sold them throughout the world. There is now no industry—<i>[Interruption.]</i> We could debate that but I do not believe that it would be in order. I am obliged to the Chair that we have been able to get through as much as we have. If I could allocate blame in two words, I would say management and unions in that order. The prime responsibility always rests with management.<br><br>
A parliamentary question is a well-known method, used by all parties, for slipping some information through quietly. On 18 December—I do not know what day of the week it was; the Government were drawing attention to what was coming—my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) was no more aware of that parliamentary question than I was. Other hon. Members were also unaware of it. Equally, I did not want to ask about the number of Bills available. These things happen. We do not make a song and dance about them. We can cope with them. They are no great problem.<br><br>
I regret to say that the Under-Secretary has given us not one argument for chopping six months off the scheme. There is no argument for it, other than the Government's pressing, insatiable appetite for doing a Pontius Pilate on the public sector, not least on those parts that are in difficulties. The Government flog off what good assets they can, writing off their debts so that they can be picked up by the private sector for next to nothing. Then they get rid of any social or commercial responsibility as quickly as they can for those parts that are in difficulty.<br><br>
Why do we have this measure introduced now? I listened to the Under-Secretary and he did not address himself even to what the Minister said on Second Reading. He has given no justification for pursuing the matter in such a way now. We have heard no justification for the cutting of the six months or for the change from a statutory instrument.<br><br>
There is only one explanation. The Government want nothing more to do with shipbuilding. They are not interested in it. The measure is connected with continuing pressure for cuts in public expenditure. The Government want to be able to say, "After the end of 1986 there will be no further continuing Government liability in the public sector borrowing requirement for redundancies in the shipbuilding industry. We don't like industry. We don't want to know about industry, least of all those industries that are in difficulty. We are generous enough to extend this scheme for a minimum period. It has been quite good in the past, but we really must get back to the market and face reality. We might as well close down now a scheme that has worked so well in the past and which may still have considerable relevance for the problems that the industry will face in 18 months."<br><br>
I cannot accept that in 18 months the uncertainty about shipbuilding will be removed, that there will be no difficulties or that a scheme that has worked so well for so many years needs to be closed down in 18 months. We have not heard one shred of argument from the Minister to suggest that the industry will be in a fit shape and fully privatised. The Government have no plan or coherent strategy for the industry. They say,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The less we have to do with it, the better."</p></blockquote> Accordingly, they are getting rid of the SRPS.<br><br>
We shall not press the amendment to a Division. It has served a useful purpose in allowing us to see that the Government have no arguments to support the 18-month period. However, we look forward to tearing into the Government on the substantive parts of the debate, which will arise on amendment No. 4.</span></p>
