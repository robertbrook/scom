Since our last sitting we have received copies of BNOC's report and accounts. I thank the Minister for having personally sent copies to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That report contains an important statement on page 10, and it conflicts somewhat with what was said by the Minister of State on Second Reading:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, because of those decisions it was necessary to come to the House for a Supplementary Estimate to cover the losses."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c.190] </p></blockquote>
However, BNOC's annual report suggests that those figures have not been covered. On page 10 we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The overall loss for the year, of £12 million, is thus almost entirely represented by provision for first quarter 1985 losses in excess of available grant."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister, as urgently and as early as possible, explain how the additional £12 million loss is to be accounted for and covered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. No doubt the Minister will at some later and appropriate stage deal with the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
to him for giving me notice that he wishes to raise the question and I shall deal with it when we discuss the financial aspects of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our first sitting, which seems quite a long time ago, I was moving amendment No. 6 and had made a few introductory remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I saw when I read Hansard that I had strayed from the amendment—largely because I felt so strongly about the Parisian lady screaming for her cat in the middle of the night. I shall not labour the point further, but the Committee will understand that I was feeling the burning irritation caused by that experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider seriously the arguments contained in this group of amendments concerning the size of the new agency? It seems reasonable that the minimum number of members should be three rather than two, and the maximum five rather than four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members—even without taking unemployment figures into account will recognise that the new agency will necessitate considerable changes. That was recognised by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). Those changes will be taking place at a time of turmoil in the organisation—staff may be feeling anxious that their careers are blighted, and that frustration is their lot. It may, therefore, be appropriate to have more people serving the agency than the Minister originally anticipated, if it is to operate smoothly and if the transition is to take place effectively and as calmly as possible. Therefore, a minimum of three members is not unreasonable, neither is a maximum of five excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) that it was good of the Minister to send the BNOC report and accounts to members of the Committee. I have not had time to read it properly, but I examined page 2 which lists the names of present members of the corporation, and the officers who are members of the management committee. Among those there may be individuals who could properly continue to serve on the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the report to the Library last night to ascertain the experience and qualifications of each member of the corporation and of the principal officers on the management committee. I looked in " Who's Who ", and was disturbed at what I found. " Who's Who " has a high reputation; I had understood that everyone who has served this country significantly is listed in it with all his relevant qualifications and experience. However, only Lord Croham, the chairman, Mr. Goskirk, the chief executive, Mr. Gavin Laird and Sir Philip De Zulueta were listed. I was therefore unable to establish the experience and qualifications of the other members of the corporation or of the senior officers who are members of the management committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. I. F. Brown is not in "Who's Who"; nor is Mr. C. G. Finch, who is listed in the BNOC report as the member of the management committee responsible for finance—a big enough task, one might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
have thought; nor is Mr. D. St. C. Harcourt CBE; nor is Mr. T. G. McLintock, who I assume is an accountant, judging from his name. A person with the qualifications in accountancy that I assume Mr. McLintock has could well be the right sort of man to serve on the agency, given the turmoil in oil finances internationally. The agency might need someone with such relevant credentials. Mr. J. A. Stewart, another member of the corporation, is also not listed in "Who's Who".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of those who are listed, one can see that Lord Croham is a man of enormous experience. People have an unfortunate habit of changing their names when they are ennobled, but hon. Members will recall that Lord Croham, as Sir Douglas Allen, was head of the Civil Service, a man of astonishing distinction in public service. He clearly retains his vigour, and has devoted at least a part of that vigour to the national interest since his retirement. He lives in Surrey, a point of interest to which I shall return later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Goskirk, the chief executive of BNOC, has devoted his professional life to the industry and has clearly achieved a mastery of it, as is shown by the service that he has given BNOC since 1976, and by his experience and qualifications. Before that he had worked for Shell International Petroleum and for the Anschutz Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Gavin Laird has been on the board of BNOC for a considerable amount of time. His address is in Glasgow, which is relevant to a point that I shall develop later. His qualifications are wide-ranging, but rest primarily on the fact that he has been a full-time trade union official in an important position since 1971 and a long-time member of the TUC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Philip De Zulueta is a former diplomat who left the diplomatic service some time ago, having served three successive Prime Ministers as Private Secretary. Since leaving the service he has developed a wide-ranging involvement in business, both national and international.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four people I have described are, as reference to " Who's Who " demonstrates, highly qualified, experienced and rightly members of the board of the corporation; they could properly continue on the board of the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed work is carried out by extremely important people, those listed in the annual report of BNOC as the principal officers and members of the management committee. I have already mentioned Mr. Goskirk who is the chief executive and obviously the leader of the management committee. There is also Mr. C. G. Finch who is a member of the board of the corporation and has responsibility for finance. It is a pity that a man with that responsibility cannot be mentioned in " Who's Who ". In view of the financial headaches that will arise when the new agency is established, if Mr. Finch is not to be given the opportunity to continue and to apply his undoubted expertise and experience, the Minister will have to look carefully at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Mr. McLintock, if my assumption that Mr. McLintock is a highly qualified accountant is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other members of the management committee whose role is relevant to the future of the agency are Mr. A. W. A. Berkeley who is involved in legal matters and is secretary to the corporation, Mr. G. R. James who has been responsible for corporate services; Mr. R. S. B. Johnstone who has been responsible for supply; Mr. D. E. Millar who has been responsible for trading in crude oil and products and Mr. K. J. Vaughan who has been responsible for trading in liquified petroleum gas and for land pipelines. Obviously, people like Mr. Millar, even with the diminished trading role of the new agency, will still have an important part to play. It will interest the Committee to know which of the officers will be fulfilling that role—whether it will be Mr. Millar or Mr. Vaughan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the agency has an important continuing role involving pipelines, clearly someone with Mr. Vaughan's experience has a vital role to play. However, if Mr. Vaughan is to act as the chief executive, he clearly cannot carry out all the tasks involved, particularly as there will be an atmosphere of turmoil and development, certainly in the first six or nine months of the new venture's life. If Mr. Vaughan's expertise lies in land pipelines and liquified petroleum gas, the fact that the LPG responsibility may not now loom large does not mean that he will be relieved of part of his burden and can maintain only his responsibility for land pipelines. As chief executive, his responsibilities will be very much wider and he may have to spend rather more of his time on aspects of the agency's life other than the land pipeline responsibility. The role and position of the other members of the management committee is clearly extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, not necessarily at great length, the Minister will be able to compensate for the sad omissions in " Who's Who " and give us some information about the members of the corporation and the management committee who are not included in the current edition of that important reference work. The Minister, who has obliged the Committee by ensuring that we received our copies of the report yesterday, can assist us still further by providing the relevant information, so that we can give a passing thought to and hold a short discussion on the sort of people he has in mind to serve the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospect of new people being brought in at this time, particularly in the trading operation, is serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that some of my earlier remarks may appear to run counter to this group of amendments, particularly to amendment No. 8. The amendment was tabled to help the Committee explore the issue and to enable my hon. Friends and me to make obvious comments about our interest and concern, not least because we represent constituencies outside the city of London with grave economic problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
Amendment No. 8 refers to a person
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"who has substantial experience within the trade union movement".</p></blockquote>
At present the corporation enjoys the benefit of the service of a member with substantial trade union experience. Mr. Gavin Laird certainly fills the bill. As a full-time trade union official for 14 years and a member of the TUC he clearly has " substantial experience ", which is already devoted to BNOC. It will be interesting to know whether someone like Mr. Laird, or Mr. Laird himself, will be given an opportunity to maintain that connection and to continue that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (c) of the amendment may be acceptable to the Minister and we await his response with great interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also refers to " a female member ". We must accept that more than 50 per cent. of the population is female. It is interesting that there is not one lady Member serving on the Committee this morning. I can see only two ladies in the Room. The oil industry is particularly guilty of male domination. If the Government wish to be consistent they will recognise that there is some merit in reserving a place to enable a lady to serve in this male-dominated industry. After all, we have a female Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the hon. Gentleman's comments have frightened one of the ladies away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that in Orkney and Shetland women feel that they have achieved a sufficient degree of liberation. In many parts of the country, they have achieved neither sufficient economic emancipation nor sufficient opportunity to serve their communities as forcefully as they wish or as forcefully as the lady who occupies. No. 10 Downing Street endeavours to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister supports the approach of his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, surely he accepts the merit of paragraph (d) of the amendment. My only reservation is that the lady should not have lived in Paris and owned a cat. It is also logical and consistent that she should not live in
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"the counties of Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire, Kent or Essex".</p></blockquote>
We did not table that provision because we dislike Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire. Kent or Essex. I am fond of much of that area and my wife came originally from Sussex. I have nothing against those counties, but far too many people who hold positions of great importance live there. Increasing the importance of residents of those counties would exacerbate the present appalling regional imbalance in Britain. Of course, the Minister of State is not responsible for the social security statement that was made yesterday, which in my opinion will compound and exacerbate the regional imbalance, but we seek to redress the imbalance by devolving and decentralising away from those counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To show that we are not being utterly vindictive about the south-east corner of the country we left out the county of Middlesex deliberately—so that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
the Minister will have an escape hatch. Our approach is highly reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two other reasons why we listed those counties. One, to which I referred before the Whit-sun recess, is unemployment. Unemployment in those counties is much higher than it was in 1979, when the Government took office. Although enormous increases in unemployment have been general, and certainly unemployment in those counties has risen since 1979, it is much lower than in some of the constituencies represented by my hon. Friends and myself, where there is unemployment of 20, 25, 30 per cent.—and perhaps 40 per cent., if the National Coal Board continues what it is doing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is beginning to wander into a discussion about unemployment again. Will he confine himself to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to do that. I merely pointed out that although unemployment is high in those counties, it is much lower than in the areas represented by my hon. Friends the Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, for Glasgow, Spring-burn (Mr. Martin), and for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron). When the oil is gone, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) will understand how serious the position could be in the northern islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for listing those counties is that when I looked at the distribution of honours, I noticed that Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire and Kent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The distribution of honours has nothing to do with the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have too much respect for you, Mr. Knox, to engage in disputation. My point is that people who live in Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire, Kent or Essex have a disproportionate share of the recognition that the nation affords to individuals. They are often recognised in a way which they may not entirely deserve. People in Yorkshire, Wales or Scotland tend to receive little recognition for devoted voluntary service, whereas people living near London are highly recognised for services for which they have often been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people serving on the agency have such an important task to perform even though Conservative Members may feel that the Government's pursuit of privatisation has diminished that task—that the Government will be duly grateful to them and give them considerable recognition and honour. If there is to be such recognition of services in our society, we should allow some redress of the regional imbalance that exists, both socially and economically, and the amendment would automatically and inevitably provide such redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may feel that what I said is contradictory, in that I spoke favourably of Sir Philip de Zulueta, who lives in Sussex, Lord Croham who lives in Surrey, and Mr. Goskirk, who lives in London. Mr. Laird has an address in Scotland, so much criticisms do not apply to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tylfil and Rhymney speaks about emoluments, I hope that he will bear that point in mind. We should ensure that those people receive increased emoluments which will allow them to move to areas not listed in the amendment and to continue their important and esteemed service. Many employees move house in pursuit of jobs—although I do not think that people we are discussing are in such an economically parlous state that they will be reduced to riding a bicycle, as others are exhorted to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's remarks suggest that he thinks the head office of the agency should be in London. Perhaps he will tell us whether he is committed to that idea, and believes it should be enshrined in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not reply to that intervention. We are not discussing the location of the office at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some hon. Members have it in mind for a short stand part discussion, if you will allow it, Mr. Knox. But the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland led me astray three or four times before the recess, so I will accept your instruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had second thoughts about paragraph (f) of amendment No. 8. If the Minister accepts the suggestion that the maximum number should be five rather than four, perhaps the fifth place could be allocated to someone
	<br><blockquote><p>"with substantial experience as an oil trader".</p></blockquote>
But that will depend on the amount of information provided by the Minister, in response to my request, about those members of the corporation or the management committee who arc not listed in " Who's Who " and about whom we lack information. It might assist the agency, if members with existing relevant service could be considered, especially if the Minister accepts that amendment No. 7 has consistency and merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining point that I wish to make concerns paragraph (g) of amendment No. 8. 1 do not wish to be accused of being barbarous, nit-picking, pompous or hypocritical, but I feel that standards must be improved. In the past few months, one or two cases have left a nasty taste in people's mouths. 1 recently saw a reference in a weekly journal to someone whose former business had obtained a substantial contract in circumstances which were described as dubious, and there have been scenes in the House about people responsible for defence procurement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we should spend a few moments on paragraph (g) concerning
	<br><blockquote><p>"a member who does not hold any equity of a major oil company".</p></blockquote>
Even though the trading role of BNOC has been diminished and will contract further under the new agency, members should not have any equity within
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
a major oil company, especially if there are only two or three of them with any degree of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, every member of the Committee would accept that that is an entirely proper proposal. I trust that if the Minister cannot accept it, he will advance powerful arguments in defence of his opposition, because we shall need to see them on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the Minister will appoint a corrupt or venal man to the new agency; no doubt he will seek to appoint competent and capable people. However, those involved must also be above suspicion. I trust, therefore, that the Minister —in the interests of probity in public life—will fully accept the proper proposal contained in paragraph (g) of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have not delayed our proceedings unduly. Although our proposals may not appear especially significant to Conservative Members, some of them are very important indeed. The Minister should accept that these purposes have to be widely served. I think that he will accept that the size of the agency as originally envisaged in the Bill—a minimum of two and a maximum of four members—is not adequate, and certainly not adequate at the minimum point. The other proposals in amendment No. 8 also have considerable merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to be mindful of industrial relations within the agency. We need to make more gestures to allow ladies in our community to ensure that their merits and abilities are properly recognised. We need to ensure that power and recognition are not increasingly concentrated in the south-eastern corner of England. Finally, we need to seek to demonstrate to the community that standards in this complex, rapidly developing area of activity are above reproach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman if he covered the point on which I seek clarification before I arrived. Is amendment No. 8 to be read in conjunction with amendments No. 6 and 7. If so, would that mean that there could be up to 11 members? Amendment No. 7 refers to five members and amendment No. 8 refers to a possible six, although I appreciate that the female member could also be the trade unionist, for example. Are the members listed in amendment No. 8 additional or would they be covered by the five in amendment No. 7?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we are realists. I agree that if the Government accepted all our amendments, the board could conceivably have nine or 10 members. Obviously, some of the members might have two, or even three, of the qualifications specified in amendment No. 8. But our point is that those qualifications are relevant and significant and should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepted our proposal in amendment No. 7 that " five be inserted instead of " four ", it is possible that each of the requirements could be met. if two of those appointed

who were living in Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berk shire, Kent or Essex, were prepared to move, we could satisfy all the requirements without increasing the maximum size of the agency as envisaged in amendment No. 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be gratified if the Minister went some way towards accepting the amendments and made appropriate appointments. I believe that that is possible as well as desirable. I await with interest the Minister's response to our sensible and responsible proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael J. Martin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Springburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy). When considering amendment No. 8, the Minister should remember that there are more than 3 million people unemployed. People pay more attention than ever to public appointments and there is a great deal of resentment. The unemployed are beginning to ask why they are not considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is probably an unemployed person who qualifies in all respects under amendment No. 8. He could devote all his time to the job. There is no point in giving the extra responsibilities to a person who already has a responsible position. The Government are often accused of creating jobs for the boys. Like many hon. Members, I have been involved in local government. When a Lord Mayor or Lord Provost completes his term of office a position on a public board also becomes available. Why should that happen? People in public life have many positions. They arc on development boards, housing agencies or public corporations such as the one that we are debating. When there are so many unemployed it is unfair that we should consider someone with a job who is well off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency job could be posted at jobcentres. Unemployed people could at least apply for it. The Minister knows that as soon as the job is available, he will receive phone calls from certain people asking to be considered. That should not go on with the present unemployment figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People with substantial Government pensions who have taken early retirement, in some cases because they could not cope with their job, have become available to take on a public job. It is all very well to say that such people are dedicated to public life and that they want to work for the community. More than 3 million unemployed people want to do a job for the community and they should be considered. If the Minister gets a phone call, I hope that he tells the caller to put his name down at the jobcentre, along with everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) on amendments Nos. 6 and 7. The clause gives the Minister power to determine how many will sit on the agency even though the Bill proposes five members and the amendment proposes seven. He does not have to decide now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's announcement about the abolition of the BNOC and the setting up of the new agency has provoked comment from the industry, as one would expect. People in the industry see it as an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
attack and hardly welcome it. Lord Croham said in this year's annual report of BNOC:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's decision has come as a severe blow to the Corporation's staff who have worked exceptionally hard over the years to establish the Corporation".</p></blockquote>
That is all I shall quote for the moment, but I shall refer later to other things that he said about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would lessen that severe blow to the staff, although clearly the abolition of BNOC and the setting up of the agency will cause further job losses. A severe price will have to be paid by the staff and by people at present on the management committee. It is clear from the figures proposed for the agency's board that although the present members of that committee may not be registered in " Who's Who ", in a few months' time they could be registered in " Who Was Who ". It is obviously that the numbers will not fit and that people in high office in BNOC will be made redundant unless the Bill is amended, although the Secretary of State has the freedom to determine how many people will sit on the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State does not have all that much freedom. Clause 1(2)(b) says that although
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may from time to time determine",</p></blockquote>
he will be unable to appoint more than four people, as I read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I have got it wrong. So unless the provision is amended, there will be a maximum of four, although the Secretary of State may determine only three. That is worse than I thought when I rose to speak. It seems that we shall have to support amendments Nos. 6 and 7 to increase the number of members, if we are to help the people who, as Lord Croham said, have been dealt a severe blow by the Government's announcement to abolish BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly unlikely that people on the present management committee who are responsible for LPG will be kept on, because the Minister announced that all trading in liquefied petroleum gas would cease once the agency was set up and that there would be trading only in crude oil. It should be possible, therefore, to go through the list and make a rough assessment of people who are likely or unlikely to survive. However, I do not wish to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we should know how many members there will be, and to that end amendments Nos. 6 and 7 should be accepted. The situation in years to come may be different, of course; a different Government may take a different view of the size of the agency and the role that it should play in the national interest. We ought to accept the amendments, and then we can move on to discuss the matter in greater depth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 8, my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth spoke about including a member of the trade union movement, and mentioned
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
the name of a highly respected trade union leader who has been a member of BNOC for several years. This matter would be covered under paragraph 	<i>(c)</i> of amendment No. 8. In our previous sitting hon. Members said that as fewer people would be working in the agency, we would not necessarily need someone with trade union experience. That is far from the truth. It is not just a question of numbers, but of contributions that people can make to the industry. Surely, even if fewer people work there, someone with experience of the trade union movement could be of benefit to the agency in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend began to make a case for why a female should sit on the agency, which is referred to in paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> of amendment No. 8. We should consider passing legislation that discriminates positively in favour of females. I suspect that many people in BNOC suspect that females have a role there, but think that they could only type and work in canteens and not be able to sit on the board and make a good contribution. 1 am a great believer in positive discrimination for women, and I should like to see a gesture from the Government who are led by a female. If the amendment, or this part of it, were accepted, one of the board members would be a female. She would have the credentials and ability to do the job, but would specifically have to be a female.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not involved in drafting paragraph (e) of amendment No. 8, which deals with people
	<br><blockquote><p>"who are not normally resident"</p></blockquote>
in certain counties, and I do not wish to go into it too far. However, we sought to highlight the plight of people both inside and outside those counties who seek work, although I am afraid that the Bill will not do much for them. Once the agency is set up and BNOC is effectively abolished, there will be job losses in all parts of the industry. I am not sure whether those who would be made redundant would be from residential areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that many people who work in BNOC and who would be eligible to move to the agency would have " substantial experience as an oil trader ". It would surely be accepted when people were appointed to the new agency that someone would have such experience. People will expect the agency to do more than is proposed in the Bill, and it should not lose expertise in years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth spoke about a member of the agency holding any equity with any of the major oil companies. I am sure that the Minister will agree that that would be entirely wrong. I know that in certain public bodies, including the one that I used to work in, people have held equities in suppliers to the industry. It is surely not right for people appointed to public office to have that kind of interest in what happens from day to day in the industry and the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will at least accept amendments No. 6 and 7, which would lessen the blow of the running-down of BNOC and the transfer to a small agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
I must say that I am surprised that nobody has mentioned ballots to elect people to hold office in the agency. I thought that the Government had entered a new era of more detailed democratic procedures, but that seems to apply to only some British institutions. This one, it appears, can be set up by means of individual appointments or those made by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stefan Terlezki 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) said that as 3 million were now unemployed we should consider appointing people who are registered in the jobcentres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will be careful to consider applicants in accordance with the public interest, and to appoint those with the necessary knowledge and abilities. Unlike Opposition Members, I do not wish to dwell on the possibility of indirect discrimination, or of making a social division or one connected with material wealth between appointees. Of course I should like to see women participating more on public bodies, but they cannot be dragged off the streets or out of their houses or jobcentres. If ladies volunteer because they think that they are capable of being appointed to such a body, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the public are really interested in public appointments; I think that they are more interested in how public institutions are run. Are they run in the interests of the public, or that of the shareholders? Are they run in such a way that production is not disrupted and goods are produced and delivered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will do his best to appoint the right people without our trying to score political points which are irrelevant to our present debate and to the Bill as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the view expressed in the first two amendments that the board should be larger. As the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) has pointed out, we are discussing a small agency without the powers and functions of BNOC. Although some Opposition Members may regret that, it is none the less the reality. I do not think we should set up some grand empire of the great and the good and those who may aspire to get their names into " Who's Who ". However, a board with two members in addition to the chairman is perhaps a bit too cosy an arrangement, and I feel that the limited increases sought in amendments Nos. 6 and 7 would be beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give amendment No. 8 my wholehearted support. It starts with the word " and ", so the persons listed would be in addition to those already provided for in clause 1(2)	<i>(b)</i>, whether or not it is amended; that could lead to a large board. I accept that that was not intended by the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy)—we can all make drafting errors, and. I am not criticising him for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if it is proposed that the four or five members of the agency should have the qualifications stipulated in the amendment, the Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
who appoints them will face an impossible job. He will have to search for a suitable female trade unionist who does not live in Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire, Kent, Essex or Greater London, and check through her portfolio of shares to ensure that she has no equity in a major oil company. One could thus get into a ridiculous position. In our last debate we said that we wished the appointees to be those who, male or female, would contribute most to the efficient and effective running of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the Government should take into account some of the sentiments expressed in amendment No. 8. It is now standard practice to have one member of a board with substantial experience in the trade union movement: that is in the best interests of industrial relations, and such a person can also lend his expertise to the board. That should carry weight with the Secretary of State when he comes to make the appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However much I approve of equal opportunities for women, I disagree with what would be, literally, the appointment of a statutory woman. Much more can and should be done to encourage women to take an active part in the oil industry which, as the hon. Member for Wentworth pointed out, is not an industry noted for female participation. if women with the requisite expertise are available, the Government, committed in principle as they are to equal opportunities, should look at suitable women who might become appropriate members of the agency, but that should not be done on a statutory basis. It is demeaning to a woman to be on the board as a statutory woman, and not to feel that she is there in her own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the residence qualifications, if the amendments had said that two members who were not Sri Lankans, Tamils, Roman Catholics or freemasons were required, there would have been a great outcry about discrimination. I do not believe that there should be discrimination against people on the grounds of where they live. I entirely support the view that there should be a greater dissemination of power throughout the United Kingdom, but there are better and more effective ways of achieving that than those proposed in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it would be to the board's advantage to have a member who is experienced as an oil trader, and I am sure that the Secretary of State will take that criterion into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the motive behind the proposal to have a member who does not hold any equity of a major oil company, but it is not always easy to enforce such a requirement. A person whose portfolio is managed for him by a stockbroker may not necessarily know whether at any one time he holds equity of a major oil company. One could impose a qualifying limit—perhaps that the holding could not be said to be an influential one—but a complete ban would be unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore cannot support the amendments as they stand, although it is useful to discuss the types of people that one hopes the Secretary of State will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
bear in mind when appointing the board of the agency, which I hope will be slightly larger than has been proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members who have spoken, as it is important to know the Committee's views on what the composition and size of the agency board might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) that the amendments would result in a board of about 10 or 12 members, although I do not criticise them on that ground. I share the hon. Gentleman's view that such a large body for what the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) described as a small agency would be over egging the pudding. BNOC, a larger body with wider responsibilities, needs a board of between only five and 12 members. To increase the new board to 10 or 12 members would not make the greatest sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the board is at the heart of our debate on the amendments. I incline to a small board. The agency's functions are limited. I have never made any secret of that fact or sought to hide it. Indeed, the criticism from Opposition Members has been that it is a small agency with limited responsibilities. It is proper to keep the size of the agency's governing body to a scale appropriate to its functions. I urge the Committee to accept that the size of board in the Bill is appropriate for the agency's functions and that to add to the numbers would not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useful to debate the background of members of the agency and it helps me. 1 have kept in mind what was said at our previous sitting. However, as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland made clear, specifying who shall serve on the board causes a kind of reverse discrimination. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) that we are trying to get the best people to run the agency. Our first criterion must be to get people with appropriate backgrounds, experience and personal qualities. Because the board will have relatively few members, provisions specifying precisely what sort of people they should be might not, if followed slavishly, secure those of the correct calibre or those most appropriate to run the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) moved his amendment, he asked about the background of members of the BNOC board. There is no shame in not being listed in " Who's Who ", it is rather a distinction. I shall give the names of those whom the hon. Member for Wentworth could not find in his researches last night. They demonstrate that even if one does not specify the backgrounds or categories from which members should be appointed, many of the qualities that Opposition Members mentioned are covered automatically when one appoints the best people to such organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Brown is chief executive of the British Linen Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland. Mr. Graham McLintock is not an accountant, so the hon. Member for Wentworth was wrong in his guess. Mr. McLintock was deputy director for BP

Europe until he retired in 1981. Mr. Stewart is managing director of Ellerman Lines, and formerly deputy chairman of ICI Petrochemicals. Mr. Harcourt is chairman of the London Commodity Exchange. I think that I have shown that, without having to specify a particular background from which a member of the corporation was recruited and from which, in the future, a member of the agency might be recruited, successive Secretaries of State in. making appointments have taken arid will be taking account of the arguments that have been raised in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather troubled about the career prospects of these gentlemen. It seems that there will be one or two retired people and one or two of considerable age and experience, and that they will have to live on the possibility of a revival of the agency at some future date, otherwise there will be little for them to do. People may regard the appointment as something of a sinecure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I agree that the activities of the agency will be limited in comparison to those of the corporation, it will still have important functions, for example, the running of the pipelines agency, the handling, of the royalty in kind oil and the custody of participation agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my hon. Friend's argument is relevant to the numbers of members appointed to the agency. They will have the responsibility of answering to Ministers and to Parliament for the considerable sums of money involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take note of what has been said in the debate about the backgrounds of those to be recruited, but I feel that specifications should not be made in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the list of members of the agency sought in amendment No. 8 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>" a member who does not hold any equity of a major oil company ".</p></blockquote>
The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-Lines Act 1975 does not contain such a restriction, although the regulations appointing members to BNOC require the Secretary of State to satisfy himself that no member has financial or other interests that could prejudice his performance as a member of the corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that also apply to the agency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman will give me a minute, I think that I may be able to anticipate the point that he is trying to raise. The procedure has been in operation up to now, without such a specific, narrow restriction as the prohibition en holding equity being written into legislation. What matters with public appointments is that there should be nothing to prejudice the performance of the member. That is what counts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will, of course, act in the same spirit when appointing members to the agency. It would be silly to go so far as to preclude the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
appointment of anyone with equity interests in an oil company. major or minor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I tell the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) that we do not intend to produce for these appointments regulations similar to those for the BNOC. Under the minutes of appointment of member of the agency, the Secretary of State will specify that a member must not have financial or other interests that would prejudice his performance. Therefore we do intend to cover that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To avoid repitition, may I ask the Minister now whether the regulations for the BNOC constitution to which he has referred were included in the legislation establishing the corporation? If they were, does he not accept that it would be worth reconsidering the matter with a view to including them in this legislation, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) read his newspaper with rather more discretion so that the Chairman cannot see it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just noticed an interesting article revealing that oil spot prices fell when OPEC called an emergency meeting.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether it is relevant to a later amendment has nothing to do with the matter under discussion. The matter under discussion is a ruling by the Chair that the hon. Gentleman should not be reading his newspaper in such a way that I can see it. If he can do it discreetly, that is a different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Appointment to BNOC was dealt with under subsidiary legislation in sections 1(4) and 46(1) of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975. In this case, I certainly intend appointments to be made by means of minutes of appointment. I believe that we should keep down the number of agency members and that we should not include the proposed restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate has been valuable. I have heard the Committee's views about the kind of person who should be appointed to the agency and 1 shall bear them in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is appointing as chairman designate of the agency Mr. George Dunkerley, who is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. He will retire from his present position as deputy senior partner of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company in the United Kingdom at the end of September, after more than 35 years' service with that firm. Mr. Dunkerley will be appointed on a part-time basis and will be appointed as a non-executive member of BNOC from today in order to provide continuity until the agency has been established. That fulfils an undertaking that I made in our last sitting about staff. It is important that those responsible for the new agency are in a position of authority on the existing corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already announced the appointment of Mr. Vaughan as chief executive designate. It is likely that he will be the only full-time member of the agency. The Secretary of State also proposes to appoint on a part-time basis Mr. Owen Heald, who recently retired from his position as manufacturing, supply and trading director of Shell (UK). During a distinguished career with Shell, Mr. Heald acquired wide experience of petroleum trading. He has also been a director, during his period with Shell, of the British Pipeline Agency Limited, which has given him considerable knowledge of the Government pipeline and storage system.

This has been my first opportunity to give the name of the chairman designate of the body, who will become a member of BNOC from today, and of the one additional appointment. I hope that that has assisted the Committee. I also hope that what I have said about the backgrounds, careers and achievements of those two men shows that many of the points that have been put forward in the debate were taken into account in considering those appointments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that, in our useful debate, I have managed to deal practically with the arguments that have been put forward; I am not insensitive to what lay behind the amendments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should first express our appreciation of the fact that the Minister was quite forthcoming in response to the request for information. I am much obliged to him for that information. One item of information that he omitted, and which would be relevant to amendment No. 8, is the place of residence of people on the board. Here I have to refer to the information about the three people who are now to serve the agency. I am sure that they serve with the good will of the Opposition. I know nothing to the discredit of those three people and they clearly have quite considerable service and relevant experience. Unfortunately, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) made clear just now, they are obviously a pro-establishment team. I hope I am wrong, but they are probably from the south-eastern triangle. They will probably be able to work perfectly happily with this south-eastern dominated Government.

There is no imagination or recognition of the industrial relations problems which will certainly exist in the new agency as a result of the appalling contraction. The Minister may feel that matters are sufficient as they stand, but the Opposition do not. I draw the Committee's attention again to amendment No. 6, which relates to the proposed minimum of two. If there is to be a minimum of two or even three members, the Minister may not intend to appoint anyone else. There will be no place for a women, an unemployed person, a Scotsman, a Welshman, or even an English woman such as the Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making an important point. This morning, the Minister announced the chairman designate and one part-time member, and it would not be unreasonable to expect that the chief executive will be a member of the board. We already have three members. That strongly reinforces amendment No. 6, because without it we shall have a very unrepresentative agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the Minister's intention. I thought I heard the Minister say that Mr. Vaughan would be the only full-time member of the board. The Government may feel that the board has already reached establishment. It may satisfy the Government, but it does not satisfy the Opposition. Although we are grateful for the graceful way in which the Minister provided information, my hon. Friends and I will vote for amendment No. 6.

My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn (Mr. Martin) referred to unemployment. It is a serious matter, and the Government had an

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
opportunity to make a gesture here. My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) spoke about the need to appoint women. He said that from time to time we may need positive discrimination. That offended the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki), who spurned positive discrimination. Perhaps he thought we espoused the cause of grabbing some woman and dragging her, kicking and screaming, into a position of responsibility. That is not our intention. We recognise that there are thousands of women—perhaps there should be scores of thousands—who now occupy positions, but they do so despite the system, rather than because of it. It is regrettable that the hon. Gentleman continually supports cynicism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West said that people are not concerned about who gets these jobs. Perhaps that is true; cynicism runs deeply in our society. There should be more public concern about who gets jobs, and we need some demonstration that the Government are prepared to appoint young people. I do not want to be rude about Mr. Vaughan, Mr. Heald or Mr. Dunkerley, but all three may, be nearer 60 than 50. Why are there no women? Why are there no younger people? A few years ago, the present Secretary of State for Energy was the subject of publicity for appointing some young people to positions that were within his gift when he was Secretary of State for the Environment. Is the right hon. Gentleman perhaps now a little older, a little harder in the arteries, and therefore a little more reluctant to appoint someone under 40 to a position—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A little wiser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a dreadful interjection. The Minister is now suggesting that anyone under the age of 50, or perhaps 40, lacks all wisdom. It is probably a good job that the right hon. Gentleman intervened from a sitting position; I gather that that is not an official Government pronouncement. However, it was a sad admission, just as it is a sad admission that we probably have three middle-aged, establishment-minded men from the south-eastern corner of England, no young women and men, no unemployed and no one from the far-flung areas of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I correct to assume that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have no objection to their being young, women or unemployed. I am unconcerned by " Who's Who ". I referred to " Who's Who " because having received the annual report yesterday afternoon, in the time available to me the only place where I could discover the expertise, experience and qualifications of individuals who currently serve the corporation was in " Who's Who ". I was astonished to find that people such as Mr. Vaughan and Mr. Millar, who have been responsible for trading in hundreds of millions of pounds,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
are not there. BNOC handled 56 per cent. of North Sea oil, and people with that responsibility and involvement ought to appear in "Who's Who". Pop stars and Back-Bench Conservative Members are included, although they do not handle 56 per cent. of the nation's oil. They may help spend it, but those who create the wealth, or whose responsibilities allow the wealth to be created, do not appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What "Who's Who" decides to publish is a matter for " Who's Who ", but who the Minister appoints to the board is a matter for the Minister, and so for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some young people, some women, some unemployed people, some people who live away from the south-eastern triangle of Britain—indeed, some ordinary people—could be given responsible posts. The establishment should recognise that it becomes inevitably enfeebled, narrow, limited and unimaginative if it merely continues with the sort of approach which the Minister, sadly, appears to have endorsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy about that, or the fundamental error which the Minister made in his assessment of our plan for the size of the body. He fell into the same trap as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), in that he thought that our amendments might create a body of 11 people or more. That is not quite true. 1 do not know what the hon. Gentleman did, but I think he added the minimum and the maximum, and then added the number of people proposed in the amendment—one person for paragraph 	<i>(c),</i> one for paragraph 	<i>(d),</i> two for paragraph 	<i>(e),</i> one for paragraph 	<i>(f)</i> and one for paragraph 	<i>(g),</i> which makes six--six and five being 11. I think that the Minister went further and added the minimum, too.,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not how we see the matter. If the Minister wished to be exceedingly generous and accepted amendment No. 8, all of those purposes could be served with a body of five, not 11. If, for example, Mr. Dunkerley, Mr. Heald and Mr. Vaughan do not live in the counties named, they serve the purpose of paragraph 	<i>(e).</i> I assume that their emoluments are not unreasonable, and that they have a fair amount of money themselves, so, if they want to assist the Minister, they could serve the purpose of paragraph 	<i>(e)</i> without any difficulty, if they do not do so already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were prepared to accept amendment No. 6 and appoint a lady who does not live in the south-east and has trade union experience—there are some—he could fulfil the purposes of our amendments with a body of four, not five. it is a bit much for the Minister to calculate that there could be a committee of as few as four members or as many as 11 or more. I am sorry that he has taken that approach. We cannot be satisfied with matters. as they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to spend too much time on these two amendments, but they are certainly worthy of the Committee's consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have the reputation of being obsessed with privatisation and pursuing that policy excessively, and we should not seem to be encouraging them—which is how amendment No. 9 might initially be interpreted. However, I tabled the amendment for an exploratory purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not subscribe enthusiastically to the Government's policy of privatisation, he will find himself in the intriguing position of having to explain his view to those of his hon. Friends whose pursuit of privatisation is more lustful and extreme. He will have to persuade Conservative Members who, although they may not hear him now because they are not members of the Committee, were heard to mutter a bit on Second Reading. Some, indeed, did not want the agency to exist at all. By making a brief contribution to this debate, the Minister could explain to them how right our purpose is, and justify our arguments in support of retaining some of BNOC's present functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, however, make it clear that we do not want to see the corporation dismantled: we believe that it has a considerable role. The intervention made a few moments ago by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire. North (Mr. Skeet), who was quite outrageously reading a newspaper earlier—I presume that he has since taken it out of the room—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman would be more discreet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Skeet. You may now read your newspaper to your heart's content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not tell the Chair what to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of doing so, Mr. Skeet. I merely intended to suggest that if you were to read your newspaper you would meet with the approval of the Opposition. I was so busy addressing Conservative Members that I failed to perceive that you had taken Mr. Knox's place. However, you will probably find what I am about to say quite interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In your intervention, Mr. Skeet, you referred to the sudden change in the price of oil. Britain's offshore heritage is too important, economically and fiscally, for the Government to put themselves at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
arm's length at the expense of expertise. familiarity and contact. That is why we feel that BNOC should have been supported rather than enfeebled and amputated. The Minister can justify our argument by defending the Bill as it stands on the question of Crown property, and I hope that his speech will be clear and persuasive enough to educate those Conservative Members who have been muttering and grumbling and who want BNOC not to be contracted but obliterated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 is also exploratory. The Minister says—and Ministers have said this of many bodies dealt with in similar Bills--that the agency will not be exempt from any tax, duty, rate, levy or other charge. It is quite proper that corporations should not be exempt from their liabilities and responsibilities. However, we are entirely justified in seeking the deletion of the word " rate " to test the Government's consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not suggest that the body should be relieved of any taxes, levies, duties or charges properly called either generally or locally, but we are entitled to ask why, if we are so close to the abolition of the rate, the Government cannot act consistently and remove the word " rate ". Conservative Members all over the country—I do not know whether any of them are present—have been echoing the Prime Minister's call for the abolition of the rate. If the Government want the country to believe that their call for the urgent abolition of the rate is serious and that they are being consistent, it is a bit much for them to introduce a Bill which calls for the payment of rates, which will not be enacted until late summer 1985 at the earliest. I am sure that the Minister being a man who respects consistency, will wish to comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business community in general is dissatisfied. I do not know whether Mr. Dunkerley, Mr. Vaughan or Mr. Heald hold pronounced views on the matter, but if they share the views of business men in Yorkshire, and in other parts of England and in Scotland and Wales, they will express vehement opinions about rates. They may wish to tell the Minister that they share our view that rates should not be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business community is angry, but, unfortunately, even some of the most competent business men have failed to perceive why their rate burden is so heavy. Because the Government do not like rates and wish them to become unpopular, they have reduced rate support grant. As a result of the cut in the Government's contribution to local authorities, businesses have to find £4 billion more this year than they had to find last year. The reference to rates in clause 1(4) is therefore more significant that it might have been a few years ago. Whereas in 1979 rate support grant covered almost two thirds of local authority spending, it now covers less than 48 per cent. That explains why the rates in Britain have risen so enormously since the Government took office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, Conservative Members have clamoured for the abolition of the rates. Some of them do not yet seem aware of whether the Government merely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
intend to abolish the domestic rate or whether they intend to abolish the general rate, which affects business—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue that line of argument too far. It is becoming slightly irrelevant to the question before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of arguing with you, Mr. Skeet. I have considerable respect for the Chair. We are discussing whether the word " rate " should be retained in the Bill. If the Government abolish merely domestic rates, the continuation of the rate demand on business remains highly relevant. However, if they intend to sweep rates away and to overturn the system that has served Britain for so many years, it is utterly pointless including the word "rate" in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us are bewildered and almost bemused by the Government's repeated commitment to abolish rates. We are entitled to ask them what they propose to do. If they intend to abolish rates, why do they not put their money where their mouth is, act consistently and say, " we shall abolish rates so soon that we do not need to keep the word ' rates ' in clause 1." We tabled the amendment to probe the Government's intentions and to express our sympathy with business in Britain, which shoulders such enormous burdens in rate demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want the opportunity to say that we resent the approach of many Conservative Members. They supported the Government in reducing rate support grant and made sure that local authorities greatly increased their rate demands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>Conservative Members now go round complaining about those local authorities for increasing their rates and tell Ministers, "Because rates have increased as a consequence of your policy, you must abolish them." it is absurd.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terlezki</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman support the abolition of rates and rate capping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to digress, but in 1974 I went to the Department of the Environment as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the late Anthony Crosland, who established the Layfield committee. It was an able and broad ranging committee with members from across the political spectrum and produced an important report which I doubt whether any Conservative Member has read in the past five years and about which I imagine the Prime Minister is utterly uninformed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not support the abolition of rates, particularly if they are to be replaced by a poll tax or by a local income tax, which would have alarming regional implications. It would be highly damaging to the principality, if not to the golden triangle. The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) should be extremely careful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It has taken me a minute to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument because of my absence from the Chair, but I think that we could keep away from the reform of the rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) asked me a question which, with my interest and background, inevitably infuriated me. I deplore the Government's policy in this matter as well as in many others but my objections here are particularly strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to ask the Government for clarification and to suggest that they conduct themselves. with consistency. They show utter inconsistency on rating. Our amendment to remove the word " rate " is not merely exploratory—it provides us with an opportunity to repeat that the situation is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 11 of the BNOC annual report says that the contraction of the corporation caused a substantial reduction in office space. That may relieve the new agency of rate demands. However, inclusion of the word " rate " seems to be a further inconsistency. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what rate payments were made by BNOC in the last full financial year, and what rate payments he expects the new agency to pay in the current year. That information will illustrate the burden that rates impose on British industry. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) reminded us at our first sitting that only 120-odd people will work for the new agency. It may be recalled that we crossed swords about that at the time. However, perhaps the hon. Member would like to know how much the agency will have to pay in rates for the accommodation of a staff as small as he envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To underline my hon. Friend's point and page 11 of the BNOC report, may I point out that under clause 3, all BNOC's property, rights and liabilities are to be transferred to the new agency. We read on page 11 of the BNOC 1984 annual report, that BNOC's administrative expenses rose from £4.7 million in 1983 to £6.4 million, and that of that increase
	<br><blockquote><p>"£1.6 million represents provision for costs incurred in 1984 and to be incurred in 1985 in respect of the Corporation's former offices which were vacated in May 1984 and remain unlet."</p></blockquote>
Under clause 3, all that property will be transferred to the agency, as well as all the liabilities, including the empty properties. Is BNOC paying rates on the unlet property that it already holds? There will be even more unlet property as a result of the contraction of BNOC's activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Before he intervened, I said that it would help the Committee to know the rate payments that BNOC made in the financial year 1984–85, as well as being told the rates that the agency will pay this year, 1985–86. However, following my hon. Friend's quite proper intervention, it would also help the Committee to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
know what rate payments were made in the financial years 1982–83 and 1983–84. Not only would that information be relevant, but it would illustrate how awful has been the increased rates demand on businesses from local authorities as a result of the reduction of the rate support grant. I shall say no more on that subject, Mr. Knox, to avoid causing you offence, but that information would be relevant both to the amendment and to the general political situation in which a Conservative party makes preposterous promises to abolish rates and to replace them by a system—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not go on about reform of the rates. That subject is not relevant to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were giving the Minister an opportunity to demonstrate consistency. I shall say no more, except that I hope the Minister will supply the information that I have asked for. I hope that his response to amendment No. 9 will mute the criticism of his right hon. and hon. Friends who do not believe that the Government have gone far enough in their dogmatic pursuit of privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I give the information that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) asked for. In 1985–86, the Westminster city council's rates bill for the two BNOC office buildings is about £750,000. I am afraid that I do not have the figure for the previous year, but I would of course be willing to obtain it for the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that in amendment No. 10 the hon. Member for Wentworth is straining at a gnat. Legislation must be framed in relation to legislation already in operation. One would have thought from what the hon. Gentleman said that decisions had already been taken, and been announced, on the review being conducted by the Government on local government finance. Even if decisions had been taken, I certainly would not be in a position to announce them today, and the hon. Gentleman would be highly surprised if I were. A review is taking place; when it is completed, and decisions taken, and the measures to implement them decided, they will apply not only to the agency, but to cornmerce and domestic property generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, while this legislation is under discussion rates are a proper and legal form of local taxation, and the Bill has had to be drafted with that in mind. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is net suggesting that the agency should be exempt from paying its proper dues. If rates are one of the proper levies to be made on it, that should be so. The hon. Gentleman must remain patient on amendment No. 10; I would not take it any further, even if it were appropriate for me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 9 were accepted, it would leave in some doubt whether the property of the agency, and particularly that property required for its functions, was the
	<br><blockquote><p>" property of, or property held on behalf of, the Crown."</p></blockquote>
In many respects, this is not the most important provision in the Bill. It is usual to provide that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
property of a public corporation is not held by, or on behalf of, the Crown. There is ample precedent for the provision. Section 2(4) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and section 1(5) of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 both provide precise parallels, and set precedents for the Bill. I see no reason for not including clarifying wording here similar to that provided in previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that I can provide the information that the hon. Gentleman is seeking by telling him that the agency will neither own, nor hold on behalf of the Crown, the oil taken as royalty in kind which it will be trading, and which is the property of the Crown; nor will the agency be owning or holding on behalf of the Crown any of the assets of the Government pipeline and storage system, although it will be accountable to my Department—representing the Crown—for the maintenance and use of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have anticipated the information sought by the hon. Gentleman, in making the distinction between owning property, in terms of buildings, and—if I may use a layman's term--handling, in terms of royalty in kind and the pipeline and storage system. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore consider withdrawing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. He has endeavoured to be helpful, especially with regard to amendment No. 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us that the rate burden imposed on BNOC by Westminster city council is £750,000. That figure is of considerable interest, and it would be useful for the Committee to be told how it compares with the previous year's figure. If the Minister can provide that information, there is no point in our pursuing the amendments, although we may return to relevant and similar topics on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to allow discussion on clause stand part, but, in view of the time already spent discussing matters, I hope that hon. Members will be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although Labour Members are committed to fight the Bill tooth and nail, both teeth and nails can be creative as well as destructive. They can help to mould and shape as well as to destroy and claw. During the debate, we have tried to discover more about the nature of the new agency, which has been born hastily and with limited functions. We had to get a feel from the Minister about the type of agency that he envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gained some impression of what he intends, especially in terms of the people he has appointed today. None of the remarks of Labour Members are intended to impugn the ability or professionalism of the appointees. I know Mr. Heald and can testify to his wide experience, although I do not know the chairman designate. With such appointees as Mr. Heald, the agency can rely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
on representation from those who know and understand the oil industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made no reference in our amendments to clause 1 to the presence of an official member. BNOC did have an official member in the form of Mr. Wiggins until his transfer and subsequent resignation in January 1985. Perhaps the Minister will give us his views about the presence of an official member on the agency. He has appointed three members to the agency—the chairman, the chief executive and Mr. Owen Heald. When BNOC was formed, the seven-member board included an official member who was known by that title and was a serving member of the Department of Energy. In view of the relationship between the agency and the Department of Energy, does the Minister intend to have an official member on the agency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not propose an amendment on that point because we could not decide whether such an appointment would be beneficial. In many respects we are keen to recommend it, but in view of the Government's attitude and the Minister's generally dyspeptic attitude to national oil corporations and their functions—although he has been forced to admit that there is a role for an agency or corporation to play—we were reluctant to have the agency under the wing or in the hands of the Department of Energy. We were therefore inclined not to support the notion of an official member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of the functions and role of the agency—we shall have a greater opportunity to debate them on clause 2—there will have to be a close working relationship between the Department and the agency. The agency will manage functions and responsibilities that belong to others. The pipelines will belong to the Department of Energy or the Crown as will the oil. The question thus arises whether the Government intend, and whether it would be a good idea, to have an official member on the agency as there was on BNOC. I should be interested to hear the answer to that.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have sought throughout clause 1 to search, seek and probe to find out the character and nature of the agency. That has been the tone of our amendments. It has certainly been the tone of my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) who has done the lion's share of the work this morning. I feel guilty about my idleness and indolence. Come clause 2 I shall get into my stride. The Minister would help us to get an image and shape of the agency if he told us his thoughts about having an official member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have adequately debated the rest of the clause. The agency will obviously inherit considerable costs. It was not wrong for my lion. Friend to draw specific attention to the large rate bill that it will inherit. It will inherit empty properties as well as emptying its own property to some extent. I assume that the agency will still be housed at least in a part of the existing office block. That is pre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
sumably something for it to decide; it would be useful to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other than that Mr. Knox, the Opposition feel that you have done us proud in allowing us to explore the possibilities under clause 1. As we all recognise, in any small Bill, one clause is the motor. Clause 2 is the motor of this Bill. Therefore after the detailed discussion that we shall have on schedule 1, we can look forward to the intensive work that needs to be done on clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one brief and relevant observation to make which I forgot to make in moving the last amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has just referred to surplus property. One of the local authorities in London is at present having a praiseworthy battle to reduce hideous displays of estate agents' notice boards. I trust that we shall not see London facing months and months of exposure to a proliferation of estate agents' notice boards outside the empty properties. Perhaps the Minister could ensure that the new agency allies itself with the responsible local authority which is seeking to pursue that campaign. It seems to have merit in respect of the environment. I trust that that would meet the approval of all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) has just said. I do not think that it is totally relevant but I have noted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthtyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) is absoluately right . the offices it occupies and those it disposes of will be a decision for the agency when it takes over. It would obviously be wrong for me to anticipate its decisions. It will start in the available accommodation but thereafter it will come to its own decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also asked me about the position of the official member. He is quite right. The post is vacant at present on BNOC but a member of the Department of Energy has been serving on the board of BNOC. One has to make a distinction between the functions of BNOC and those of the new agency. BNOC had certain direct and continuing relationships with the Secretary of State and the Department of Energy and it was helpful having an official member on it. We do not intend to have an official member from the Department of Energy on the board of the new agency; that does not seem necessary or appropriate given the more limited responsibilities of the agency. However, the legislation does not preclude it, in case it is thought appropriate at some time in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In anticipation of the long debates which we are about to embark upon—according to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney—I shall conclude my remarks. I hope I have dealt adequately with the points that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>THE AGENCY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 6, line 9, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall, on ceasing to hold office, be eligible for reappointment ".</p></blockquote>
The Government failed to meet the reasonable suggestions that we put forward on clause 1. I feel that, if they insist on retaining schedule 1 as it stands, they will be guilty of an arrogance which is alien to the Minister's general political approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the agency were to have 11 members, as he thought our amendments implied, the Minister might be justified in saying that working in such a small agency would not broaden their experience and responsibility enough, and that to enhance their qualifications we should keep them on a bit longer. Given, however, that there will be so few of them, working so intensely, they may have burnt themselves out by the time they have finished their term. In that event, it will not be in the national interest to reappoint them. Moreover, if there are to be only two or three members, already in the age group which is now acceptable to the Secretary of State—he seems to have spurned his previous approach of appointing people who are young and dynamic--we can only hope that as the years pass, if the Government and the country are so unfortunate as to retain the present Secretary of State, he will return to the approach that he adopted when he was Secretary of State for the Environment and become more sympathetic to the idea of appointing younger people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we hope to see such a change in the right hon. Gentleman's character, we should help to effect it by removing the eligibility in the schedule and making it easier for him to appoint younger men. If, on the other hand, Mr. Dunkerley, Mr. Heald, Mr. Vaughan and anyone else who is appointed—and unless the Minister reconsiders the matter on Report there will be only one more--do their job with competence, it will be harder for the Secretary of State to replace them if the ability to reappoint them is provided by statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the schedule is amended, it will not prevent the Secretary of State from reappointing them or from allowing them a short time for recreation and recovery before a second appointment at a later date. The schedule as it stands is excessively rigid and harsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter, which can probably be dealt with in more detail on the next amendment. I know that the Minister has been extremely busy encouraging the excessive rape of our offshore resource, so he may not have had time to read the Treasury document on nationalised industries—a document of enormous and serious importance. He should read it and them reconsider the question of eligibility, because he could be putting an appalling strain on an individual who may not wish to subscribe entirely to the limitations that will be imposed on those who serve on public bodies, once the Treasury has enacted legislation on the basis of the consultative document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
I imagine that the consultative document will produce legislation in 12 or 18 months—that is, while Mr. Heald, Mr. Vaughan, Mr. Dunkerley and the one other person to be appointed are serving their current terms. Those men are obviously acceptable to the establishment. They have no record of rocking the boat, and as they become even older, they will not wish to start rocking the boat. They will be placed in an embarrassing position in the light of the new terms of appointment, new control and the new puppeteering that will develop as a consequence of the Treasury document and the law that will result from it. Therefore, to make life easier for the individuals, and to assist the Secretary of State in providing fresh blood and new young dynamism, the Minister should delete those limiting words from schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister should consult lawyers. I am not a lawyer, and would be grateful for advice on this matter, but it seems to me that even if the amendment were accepted, a person will be able to be reappointed, both immediately or later. The Minister may wish to take advice from his Department. I trust that he will realise that we are not trying to delay the Committee, but the present wording is unneccessary and rather dangerous, perhaps inhibiting the agency from ensuring sufficient vigour in its leadership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to tell the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) that I do not need to consult my officials on the effect of the amendment. In fact, the amendment would not restrict the Secretary of State from reappointing someone. If the hon. Gentleman intended to prevent reappointment, he would have to table an amendment to that effect. The hon. Gentleman may be tempted to do that. I feel that I am giving gratuitous advice, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, I am very generous on these occasions, and within limits I shall be happy to consider assisting him with the drafting of his amendments, provided that they are good and constructive ones. There will be no change in the effect of the legislation. There is a lot to be said for keeping the wording as it is. as it makes it clear that someone can be reappointed. Otherwise that would be doubtful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wentworth talked of the need for fresh blood and dynamism, but I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his successors have the opportunity not to reappoint if they so want. However, if someone has provided a particularly good service as a member of the agency and continues to make a good contribution in respect of the staff and the industry, it would be a shame to exclude that person from the opportunity to give further service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. It is desirable to have the flexibility to be able to reappoint in appropriate circumstances. There have been precedents for that in previous legislation, though I do not base my argument on that. It is better to make it clear that it is possible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
to reappoint, and not leave out words which, anyway, would have no effect on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the years when we have sat on Standing Committee, we have often been told that irrelevant words and parts of legislation are bad. If the Secretary of State has the power to reappoint, surely these words are redundant, and if so, the Committee should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Alas, not all of us are lawyers. I agree with the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) that it is worthwhile leaving out unnecessary words if it is possible, but it is also worth including words if it helps laymen such as myself to understand what the legislation contains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the words were not included, some people without the benefit of a legal training and experience might think that a possibility was excluded. Although attempts may have been made to take out such words in the past, the wisdom of the House on this and previous occasions has been to include the words to help poor laymen like me so that we can be sure of the truth. I am sure that other Conservative Members would agree that that they would prefer that extra clarification, and I am sure that Opposition Members would, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better to retain the flexibility and make that flexibility clear so that ordinary people who read the Bill know that reappointment is possible. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue the amendment. I hope that he understands the thinking behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I came in this morning I assumed that we would dispose of amendment No. 29 in six or seven minutes at the outside. The Minister will recall that I said to him that it would help the Committee if he made sure that he had had proper advice. He then said that he did not need advice, and that he could explain the matter thoroughly. Then, two or three times within five minutes in his speech, he busily reminded the Committee that he was not a lawyer, that he was a layman and that therefore he could not properly inform the Committee. I hope that the Minister will read the report of his speech and see that it contains this dreadful and preposterous inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I thought that we should dispense with the amendment in a short time, I now feel that we should put the arguments more firmly. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has just pointed out that many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have thought for a long time that we should not include unnecessary verbiage in law. The Minister said that he was a layman and had not had the benefit of legal advice, and said that we can only go on the evidence before us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not misquote me. I did not say that I had not had the benefit of legal advice. I said that I did not need fresh legal advice on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to accept that the Minister has recalled the advice he has already been given and we can only hope that he has remembered it accurately. We must operate on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the assumption that the advice the Minister once received is accurate we are confirmed in our view that the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall, on ceasing to hold office, be eligible for reappointment ".</p></blockquote>
are utterly superfluous and another example of wasting words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the 11 words that do not on the surface appear necessary are just part of the costs incurred when people get lawyers and barristers to draw up documents. The words may be included because the charges for drafting Bills cost the taxpayer a lot of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) makes an important point. We are trying to reduce public expenditure by simplifying the law, yet the Minister is seeking to insist—I hope that the Whip will not impose a vicious discipline on his party—that we include 11 unnecessary words. It would be interesting to discover how much each word would cost in public expenditure over the years. The cost must be at least £10 a word so we can save the public purse £110 by accepting the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase is unnecessary, but it contains an implied danger. As the Minister says, the Secretary of State can reappoint people if he wishes without those words being included in schedule 1. The difficulty is that if the words appear they will inevitably encourage people to believe that they are entitled to be reappointed or that they have a better chance of reappointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage in his existence, the Secretary of State apparently wants people in late middle age. That is obviously the current fashion because Conservative Members muttered, " Quite right " when I referred to the matter earlier. In a previous role, the Secretary of State appointed younger people and he may wish to return to that trend. The appearance of such words will strengthen the view of those whom the Secretary of State has appointed that they are entitled to be reappointed. The words may not be only superfluous, but prejudicial to the effective appointment and changeover of personnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not given a vast amount of detail about those who have been appointed. For example, when their present terms of office expire, they may be about 60 or 61. Yesterday, we were told that the Government had suddenly become flexible about retirement ages. The appointees may feel that they can serve another term, perhaps taking them to 66 or 67.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the term of office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will take note of that question and inform my hon. Friend when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point is most important. We need to know how long the term of office will be. If it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
five years, the appointees may be past retirement age if it is still relevant to talk about retirement age. By then the Secretary of State may not have returned to his previous practice of appointing young men. He will be older himself. His hon. Friends may persist in the attitude they displayed earlier in the debate and he may feel that he must retain their approval. Then, elderly gentlemen will be reappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not highly desirable that the position of elderly gentlemen should be enhanced when younger and more dynamic people—perhaps ladies or trade union officers—have a contribution to make but are denied by the Government's present arrangements. That denial will be strengthened by the retention of these superfluous and wasteful words. If we are to have any respect for the English language we must understand that one of its virtues is that it is an economic language. Sometimes in Europe, I have listened to simultaneous translations while watching Italian politicians speaking. It always seems to me that they have 14 words for every one of ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister, who is a Scot, does not have the same affinity with or loyalty to the English language as some of us do and is not so eager to maintain that commendable quality of economy. But I believe that we are entitled to ask him to remove the words to maintain that characteristic. I trust that he will respond favourably this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terlezki</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A lot will be said and a lot of time wasted on the words " and shall ". I am not a lawyer and do not have the linguistic knowledge of a lawyer. However, if I had served the agency I would find the words " and shall ", taken as part of the whole line, courteous, ethical and respectful. It would not necessarily follow that I would have the automatic right of being reappointed if I reapplied or that the Minister would consider that I had that right. The appointment would depend on many factors. I repeat that the words "and shall" are courteous, ethical and respectful, and they should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear those words, although they are strange coming from the hon. Gentleman, because they show no allegiance to the idea of market forces. It is a delight to hear the hon. Gentleman giving words such as courtesy, significance and respect. We have much sympathy with his view on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees of the agency would certainly be entitled to the respect and consideration to which the hon. Gentleman has properly paid tribute. But we are not talking about employees. Apart from Mr. Vaughan, they will be individuals appointed, rather than elected, on a part-time basis. I do not know whether they will even have a contract of employment. Those people will be given the job of keeping an eye on the agency and of participating in the decision-making process on behalf of the community. Even though they may do an honest and conscientious job, it may be inappropriate for them to feel that they are entitled to serve for as long as they wish. They should serve for as long as it is in the community's interests for them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not suggesting that the Secretary of State should sack those people; we offer no tribute to brutal employer tactics. However, the Secretary of State already has the capacity to reappoint and, it is utterly unnecessary for that to be repeated elsewhere in the Bill. It is not in the national interest for unnecessary words to appear in law. Such words may change people's attitudes and make them feel—this should certainly appeal to Conservative Members—that they are more secure in their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I view such words with suspicion, especially when they emanate from a Government of the political views to which the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) subscribes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
