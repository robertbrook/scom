<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also considering the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 31, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"; provided that with respect to any agreements entered into on behalf of the Crown relating to pipelines and storage installations the Agency shall consult and receive the approval of the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Energy before entering any such agreements."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 32, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"; provided that in carrying out on behalf of the Crown activities with respect to pipelines and storage installations the Agency shall prepare and publish separate accounts for these activities."</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Portillo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Enfield, Southgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as I know that the Committee has already spent some time deliberating on these amendments. As I said before lunch, the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has done me a disservice. For example, he said that I was in favour of privatising anything that moved, but that was extremely unfair, because, as I think the hon. Gentleman will recognise, the pipelines and storage system does not move and yet I am strongly in favour of privatising that. He also accused me of being in favour of privatising my grandmother. I assure the hon. Gentleman that both my grandmothers were firmly and unshakeably in the private sector; they were not nationalised. I can only interpret his remarks as meaning either that grandmothers are nationalised or that they should be. I predict an electoral catastrophe for his party when that nasty proposal becomes public knowledge—and I shall do my best to ensure that it does.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman became obsessed at one point with my education, which obviously troubled him considerably. He referred to his own education—I think, at Merthyr Cyfartha comprehensive school—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should be speaking to the amendment and not discussing the education of hon. Members, however interesting that may be.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Knox, for causing me to turn the page of my notes and not to proceed with those remarks.<br><br>
My argument is that the reason for state ownership of an asset is not highly relevant. The question is not how state ownership came about, but whether it should continue or is likely to become desirable in the near future. It is clear that the pipeline system has a strategic value, and that is an important point, which I do not seek to deny. However, the fact that it has a strategic value is not conclusive; it does not decide whether the system should or should not be kept in the public sector. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) pointed out, many other things of strategic value are held in the private sector, both in this country and in others.<br><br>
Confidential matters are involved here, of course, and Ministers are in the best position to judge whether strategic considerations outweigh all other considerations and whether, in this case, privatisation is desirable.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Minister of State assured me that the option of privatisation had been carefully considered by Ministers, which I was pleased to hear, and that it would not be closed for all time, that we would need, from time to time, to ask whether it was suitable for the pipelines system to remain in the public sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North is not present, but I think that I speak for him in saying that we are pleased to receive those assurances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come to the second major issue in subsection (1), which although quite short, is packed with import and significance. We have just debated matters relating to pipelines and storage installations. It is interesting that the word "pipeline" occurs in the Bill only in paragraph <i>(a)</i>—apart, of course, from in the title. The second part of the subsection covers the equally important issue of the agency's role in managing royalty-in-kind oil.<br><br>
Under amendment No. 33 we shall be considering such factors as the fees involved. Amendment No. 46 crosses the boundary between royalty oil and participation oil, while Amendment No. 47 relates to the exercise of participation rights. The subjects of the amendments are large but I hope that they are not indigestible, they are linked and stretch across two major areas of policy—the way in which royalty oil is managed and traded and the amounts involved, and the important issue of how rights in participation oil are to be exercised. Central to the clutch of amendments is the argument about how oil supplies are secured.<br><br>
The purpose of three of the four amendments is to put up ideas about establishing practical and effective control over a meaningful percentage of our oil, perhaps involving a combination of royalty oil and participation oil. Underpinning those amendments is the central argument which partially divides the Front Benches. There is also a three-way element, as some Government Back Benchers do not believe that any form of trading in participation oil, and possibly royalty oil, makes a meaningful or significant contribution to the security of supplies.<br><br>
In the group of amendments there are two major propositions. First, how best can the nation's oil supplies be secured. Amendment No. 47 suggests that the option in question should relate only to those fields that the agency
<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the Secretary of State considers the most appropriate in ensuring the maximum security of oil supplies to the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
through the exercise of participation oil rights. Royalty oil and the its role in securing our national supplies is also fundamental to the amendments.<br><br>
Two major questions arise from the amendments. First, to what extent does the control by an agency or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
corporation over the destination of crude oil supplies coming from the United Kingdom North sea help to secure our oil supplies? Secondly, how much crude oil will be required to ensure security in any crisis short of the most dramatic international crisis which triggers off other emergency legislation? Those two points have been fundamental to debates stretching back to 1982 and to the argument about the role that the agency may play in the security of our oil supplies, and they are especially relevant to the amendments.<br><br>
I hope that I do not embarras the Minister or myself by saying that there has been a curious sort of common ground between us and the Government on the matter of oil supplies. Since 1979, there has been agreement between the Government and the Opposition that a measure of control over the supply of our crude oil coming from the North Sea has contributed to that security.<br><br>
It was not a Labour Secretary of State, but a Conservative one, who in 1979-80, in the middle of the oil crisis of that time said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am considering taking royalties in kind which may help United Kingdom refinery suppliers and their customers' needs. BNOC's direct access to participation oil, together with North Sea oil, strengthens our position."</p></blockquote>
That was a Conservative Secretary of State stating in the middle of an oil crisis that he saw managing and trading royalty in kind as opposed to taking cash, plus the direct access to and direct trading in participation oil, as strengthening the nation's oil position in a time of national crisis and shortage.<br><br>
I do not therefore feel that I have to make the case—it was more strongly challenged by Conservative Back Benchers, certainly on Second Reading—that there is some common ground that the combination of royalty oil in kind plus participation oil added up to a significant improvement in strengthening the security of oil supplies.<br><br>
The trouble is that the Government have chopped and changed, and changed their mind about the basis on which they argued the case. That was so in 1979—we should take the word of a Secretary of State who was the last man to play a part in a oil crisis—and it has since been confirmed by the actions of the former Secretary of State for Energy—the present Chancellor of the Exchequer—who in 1982, when in his strongest privatising mood, chose not to privatise BNOC. Not only that, but he maintained the BNOC trading side—the organisation that the Bill will abolish—because he believed that the direct trading and exercising of rights to participation oil by BNOC was a basic form of securing oil supplies.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo), was the political adviser of the Secretary of State for Energy in 1982; he is shown as having been an adviser at some time. In that year, the Secretary of State for Energy, who is now the Chancellor of the Exchequer, came to the conscious decision—no one would charge him with not being an arch-privatiser—not to privatise or abolish BNOC trading. I do not wish to weary the Committee with endless Hansard references, but he and his fellow Ministers stated that the exercising of rights by BNOC over participation oil was an important part of our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0167">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
security of oil supply arrangements. That was not said by a Socialist—two successive Conservative Secretaries of State concluded that there was a significant role for an oil trading corporation which would exercise and not merely hold rights in participation oil, because that would help to ensure stability of oil supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the record, when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was Secretary of State for Energy and took that policy decision, he did not have the benefit of my advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad about that. At least the hon. Gentleman is consistent and I do not believe that he would disavow my description of the former Secretary of State, whom he has advised politically, who stated in 1982 that there was a vital role for BNOC in exercising rights over participation oil as an integral part of the arrangements for securing our oil supplies.<br><br>
There was further confirmation of that role when we debated the Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Bill. The Minister of State participated in those debates, and he will recall that the basis on which he argued was that royalty oil played a very modest role in the security of oil supplies. I refer in particular to columns 89 to 93 of the <i>Official Report</i> of the Committee dealing with that Bill which reports him as saying that while royalty oil played only a small part, the real basis for security of oil supplies lay in exercising rights over participation oil. I do not believe that the right hon. Gentleman would deny that the basis of his argument was that it really did not matter that we were forgoing royalty oil in future oilfields because, after all, we had what he called a much larger "public take" of oil as we were exercising participation oil rights.<br><br>
By 1983, two successive Secretaries of State had concluded that there was a role for both royalty oil and participation oil in ensuring the security of our oil supplies. Even when the Government came to abolish royalty oil in future oilfields, they argued that the reason why we could afford to do so was that we were exercising participation oil rights and thereby had a much larger public take. Therefore, we could still control the destiny of a significant percentage of oil. As I trace the argument that leads to the amendments, I find that, fairly consistently since 1979, two Conservative Governments have supported the principle that royalty oil and participation oil or a combination of both play a significant part in the security of our oil supplies.<br><br>
There was a change of tack with this Bill. The Minister is now saying, "No, sorry, I have changed my mind almost completely. Whereas in 1983 I argued that royalty oil did not play much part in securing our oil supplies, participation oil is the key and we are exercising our rights to it." But when the Minister made a statement in March on the abolition of the BNOC and announced that the new agency would not exercise any rights over participation oil, he said that, with the exception of keeping the agreements intact, it did not matter whether he exercises participation oil rights. But that had been the argument against extending participation in royalty oil. The Minister said that the key point about security was that he had royalty oil and agreements in principle.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
There is more than a little standing arguments on their head if one follows this matter. In 1983, participation oil was more important than royalty oil, but in 1985, royalty oil plays an important part in securing oil supplies, whereas any public take of participation oil is not relevant.<br><br>
The arguments over the last three years as we have tacked and changed have been nonsense and have had nothing to do with security of supply.<br><br>
At the core of the amendment is our belief that the Bill, like the Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Act 1983 and the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, will weaken control over the security of our oil supplies.<br><br>
I must answer another case against the amendment that was made not by the Minister but by his Back Benchers on Second Reading. An increasingly vociferous chorus has said that control over any of our oil supplies does not matter and that a panoply of other powers, such as the Energy Act 1976 and the International Energy Agency, the assurances of the oil companies that the Minister spoke of on Second Reading, the changing markets and oil glut make the arguments irrelevant.<br><br>
The Minister has not bought that line in toto. He has flirted with parts of it and has not destroyed or opposed it, but he has not given it his blessing.<br><br>
On Second Reading, Conservative Back Benchers suggested that no control is necessary over crude oil supplies and that security can be provided by other means. I shall tell the Committee briefly why I believe that that argument is fallacious.<br><br>
On more than one occasion we have suggested, as has the Minister, that reliance on the sledgehammer legislation of the 1976 Act combined with the International Energy Agency arrangement would be an inadequate response to the various crises that we may face. Not only do I refute that suggestion, but the International Energy Agency also seems to have refuted it this week. The IEA has published reports on each country's energy requirements. An article in the <i>Financial Times</i> about oil policy complacency and the fears of the IEA stated that in the event of even a slight disruption there could be a significant crisis in oil supplies and prices. Last weekend the IEA described a situation that would not be covered by the 1976 Act or any of the IEA arrangements and stated that in the event of even a slight disruption in supplies there could be serious consequences and crises, short of the great disruption that would trigger off the provisions of the Energy Act.<br><br>
We are discussing situations that would fall short of triggering off the provisions of the Energy Act 1976.<br><br>
It is worth remembering that the 1976 Act, in exercising reserve powers, would require international agreements and a declaration of national emergency by Parliament before many of the provisions could come into force. Many fluctuations in price and shortages fall far short of that and could certainly not be covered by the sledgehammer provisions of the 1976 Act. Indeed, the Energy Act was not invoked once during the crisis summer of 1979, although one nation had every right to invoke it. As I recall it, the Swedes experienced a shortfall greater than 7 per cent and wished to trigger the IEA provisions, but were leant on heavily by other nations—the United States in particular. One problem is that by exercising such powers one multiplies the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
crisis. That is why I do not think that we can do away with any form of control of our crude oil supply on the ground that we could use the powers contained in the Energy Act.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Erewash (Mr. Rost) is not here. He is a regular attender of energy debates and is a member of the Select Committee, so I am sad that he is not with us on this Committee. Hon. Members will recall that his argument was a variation on the Energy Act argument: all the oil from the North Sea has to be landed in the United Kingdom; if an emergency arises we can rush through emergency national legislation in 48 hours or so to take control of oil supplies; therefore, we do not need an agency to trade in meaningful quantities of crude oil.<br><br>
Exactly the same case can be made against that approach to a crisis as can be made against the exercise of the Energy Act. First, the crisis would have to be massive for such a procedure to be acceptable. Such national legislation would override all sorts of international obligations and all sorts of contractual arrangements made by multinational and UK oil companies, and the pressure from the IEA and the EEC not to introduce such high-profile unilateral legislation would be enormous. I do not think for one moment that the 1979 crisis of shortage of supply would have been alleviated in any way by a piece of dramatic unilateral national legislation.<br><br>
It would certainly require legislation to do what the hon. Member for Erewash suggests. Although, as he pointed out on Second Reading, all North Sea oil has to be landed in the United Kingdom, much of it is landed at the Sullom Voe, Hound Point and Orkneys terminals and then shipped on because there are no refineries in the vicinity of those great terminals. One would have to terminate a series of shipments to other parts of the world because, as we shall discover when we discuss a later amendment, less than 40 per cent of our oil is refined here. We should therefore need powerful unilateral legislation to deal with a crisis, and I do not believe that that is the answer to our problem.<br><br>
I am sure that Conservative Back Benchers have been wrapped on the knuckles for any contribution that they have made to the debate. However, I hope that they will at least be able to answer the case that I have made against their argument on Second Reading. I do not believe that Energy Acts, IEA arrangements or emergency unilateral legislation could ever be the answer to crises falling below the famous 7 per cent shortage category of crisis. A number of crises of lesser severity than the 7 per cent shortage scenario can be handled by the sensible exercise of managing and trading our own oi1.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
That is the basis of our whole case: that the agency should, as BNOC has done, manage royalty oil and trade in a significant percentage of participation oil. It is, should and will be in the business of trading in a sufficient amount of oil to be able to affect changes in the market if and when the supply of oil gets tight in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The Minister has joined his Back Benchers in saying that we do not need much control over crude oil supplies because we have those famous assurances
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
from the oil companies. The Minister will recall—I shall not quote him verbatim, although we can look at what he said in greater detail if necessary—our exchanges on Second Reading on the question of what the assurances were. Pressed by more than one hon. Member to explain what form the assurances took, the Minister said that he would help the House by elaborating on the form of the assurances.<br><br>
In what form are the assurances? Are they in the form of contractual obligations? Are they just promises given by letter? Do the assurances cover all the major oil companies in the North sea, or just a few, or just some of them? Do they cover any particular length of time? Are they tied to any particular time-scale or set of events. Is there a form of assurance common to all the major oil companies? Are they hedged by conditions? If so, under what conditions would they be triggered off? Who would decide whether those conditions had been met? In other words, what is the nature of the supply assurances whose existence has given comfort to Conservative Members? We have not seen them; the Minister promised to tell us more about them, and I hope that he will take this opportunity to do so.<br><br>
We believe that the most effective and practical form of assurance is not a paper agreement with national and multinational oil companies that can be activated only six or 12 months after a crisis has started. The best form of assurance is obtained by having an agency actively trading in a proportion of our own crude oil, and therefore having a degree of control over the destination of that oil.<br><br>
That is the contention on behalf of BNOC that we have made and shall continue to make. We believe that BNOC has already demonstrated the merits of our argument. A combination of trading in a sufficient quantity of participation oil on a regular week-to-week, month-to-month basis, and of managing the royalty oil is the best, most practical form of assurance of at least a measure of control over our own supply, and hence over our security of supply?<br><br>
We believe what the Secretary of State said in the summer of 1979—that there is a case for a combination of royalty in kind oil and participation oil forming a practical and effective way of securing oil supplies.<br><br>
What is the minimum amount required to achieve that? In a statement on 13 March of this year, the Minister repeated at least three times that the fact that the agency would be managing and trading in royalty oil would make an important contribution to the security of our oil supplies.<br><br>
Royalty oil will in 1986 run to about 280,000 barrels a day.—No doubt most of it will come into the oil terminal at Sullom Voe, fed by a mixture of fields—Brent, Thistle, Dunlin, Hutton NW and Murchison. It adds up to about 110,000 barrels a day at present. Again, royalty oil comes there from Ninian, Heather and Magnus, although that is a much smaller amount. It also goes to the Orkneys from Piper, Claymore and Tartan; I estimate from the Brown Books and other sources that about 30,000 barrels a day of royalty-inkind oil is involved.<br><br>
Then there are the major fields such as the Forties fields, the oil from which goes to BP's Hound Point terminal, as it does from the Brae field and a few others; the amount is about 50,000 barrels a day. Addi

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
tionally, there is another group of oilfields, such as Statfjord and Beryl with about 18,000 and Fulmar with about 16,000 barrels a day of royalty-in-kind oil. So the two types of fields-those that serve a terminal and those that are basically offshore-will have roughly 280,000 barrels of royalty barrels a day in 1986. Six fields will have none, as we abolished royalty-in-kind oil in respect of them under the Petroleum Royalties (Relief Act) 1983. Among those fields are Maureen, Argyll, Buchan and Beatrice.<br><br>
The major companies supplying royalty oil, such as Shell, Esso and BP each give the Government about 50,000 barrels a day. Again, Mobil provides about 12,000 barrels. Then there is another group of refiners -Amoco, Chevron, Conoco, Getty and Murphy-giving another 35,000 barrels. I am trying to describe first, where the royalty oil comes from and secondly, the companies who supply it to the Government-or to the British National Oil Corporation. I assume that the new agency will manage that oil.<br><br>
The fundamental problem with royalty-in-kind oil as a form of security of supply is that it is diminishing. The Minister described it as "self-extinguishing". Apparently a commodity that is an integral part of our security of supply arrangement is actually going to extinguish itself, and therefore decline, which it will do as the fields from which the royalty oil comes decline. One of the reasons why our amendment included a base limit of oil that the agency will trade and manage was to try to deal with the problem of declining royalty oil<br><br>
Put simply, if the Minister argues, as he did on 13 March, that royalty oil has a role to play in the securing of our oil supplies, and if it is to decline, either it must be made up from somewhere else or other provision has to be made in its place to bolster the security of our oil supplies. We cannot argue that royalty oil in kind is an important part of our security arrangements and at the same time announce that it is declining but that it does not matter. It either matters, or it does not.<br><br>
Some Conservative Back Benchers do not think that it matters. The Minister thinks otherwise. He has said that it is important for the agency to trade and manage royalty oil. He claims that it is an important part of our security of oil supply. The trouble is that it is a declining supply, almost to the point of extinction.<br><br>
I have tried hard to calculate what the decline will be, because it is relevant to my amendment No. 46, which seeks to provide that the agency:
<br><blockquote><p>"shall exercise the option or serve election notices to take petroleum under the participation notices to ensure that, combined with royalty oil, it manages or trades at any time not less than 250,000 barrels a day."</p></blockquote>
In the not-too-distant future the agency will manage a small and declining percentage of royalty oil. Amendment No. 46 aims to keep at least a base load in trading and managing oil for the agency in the future.<br><br>
What is the decline? I have done some calculations, and I should be grateful if the Minister would give the Department's assessment and calculations so that I may see whether my assessment is correct.<br><br>
Royalty oil comes from Ninian, Brent, Forties, Statfjord, Beryl, Fulmar, Piper and Claymore-that is a clutch, not a total list, because I do not wish to weary the Committee with a comprehensive list. That was a best sample of fields which at present attract royalty oil in kind.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
I did not do the calculation. Wood Mackenzie are extremely gracious to Members of Parliament in providing information. They are a most reputable firm of oil analysts. I have taken their most recent field-byfield analysis-these are updating figures-to try to assess what will happen to royalty oil in the 10-year period 1985–95. This has come at a time when the Minister celebrated with a crumbling cake the 10th anniversary of the first barrel of oil coming onto our shores, and it is not a particularly optimistic or attractive profile to uncover.<br><br>
The big Ninian field, which, according to Wood Mackenzie, has a total of 205,000 barrels a day in 1985, will by 1990 have 85,000 barrels a day, and by 1995, 60,000 barrels a day. Do the Government accept that as a reasonable assessment?<br><br>
Brent field goes from the massive 480,000 a day in 1985 to 323,000 barrels in 1990, to 158,000 barrels in 1995. Forties—another major mature oilfield—goes from 360,000 barrels in 1985 to 110,000 in 1990 and to 25,000 a day in 1995—a most fantastic and dramatic drop in what has been the core centrepiece of the last decade of North sea oil.<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
The United Kingdom Statfjord oil goes up from 71,000 barrels to 107,000 by 1990, but falls back again by 1995 to 55,000 barrels of oil. Beryl goes from 105,000 to 116,000 and then back down to 71,000 barrels a day. Fulmar currently-if both of Wood Mackenzie's assessments are right-produces 135,000 barrels a day and will go down to 90,000 by 1990. and 25,000 by 1995. Piper will go from 190,000 to 50,000 by 1990 and to nil, according to Wood Mackenzie, by 1995. Finally, Claymore, in this clutch of fields that I have borrowed from the Wood Mackenzie assessments, goes from 90,000 barrels a day to 32,000 in 1990 to 19,000 by 1995.<br><br>
When the Minister replies, will he say whether he believes that the Wood Mackenzie assessments are reasonable and provide an analysis of the future declining profile of North Sea oil from our mature fields?<br><br>
That calculation means that from this clutch of fields, which are the major fields from which royalty-in-kind oil comes, we go from 1.636 million barrels a day to 813,000 barrels a day by 1990 to 413,000 barrels a day by 1995.<br><br>
If that is a reasonable assessment-I divide by roughly 8 or 12 per cent whatever the case called for, but I hope that the Minister will help us in this regard-and we take it as the profile of this clutch of fields from which all the royalty oil is at present derived, we find that royalty in kind oil will decline from about 270,000 barrels a day now to about 105,000 barrels a day in the space of five years, and then down to a quarter of what it is now by about 1995. These are very dramatic figures in relation to the way in which royalty—in-kind oil is to be available to Governments as a part of their security of oil supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wallace <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To what extent can royalties currently taken in cash be taken in kind in the years ahead? Has the hon. Gentleman those figures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. Very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
little has been taken in cash since 1979. The Minister may know. But when we discussed this matter in 1982 I recall that the then Secretary of State for Energy did not exercise his right to take royalty-in-kind oil from one or two small fields and took it in cash, partly because the amounts were relatively small—that was his argument—and almost too fussy to bother with. At that time, it was felt that he preferred the cash because he had so much participation oil available that he did not need the extra top-up, but that was before the Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Act 1983.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's pertinent point, from there on, this is all that will be available. There is no provision to take any form of royalty oil in cash or in kind on the new oilfields. That was the effect of the 1983 Act—all the future fields would be exempt from royalty oil in cash or kind. That was how I understood the position and I think that the Minister will agree that it was the basis of the 1983 Act.<br><br>
Therefore, the amount of royalty-in-kind oil is finite and declining at a dramatic pace. According to my calculations, the amount will have been halved within five years and halved again within 10 years. I hope that the Minister will give the Department's latest estimates when he replies. It is no longer a question of future choices; there will be no choice. That is why amendment No. 46—for which I hope that I can attract the support of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace)—is so relevant. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Agency shall exercise the option or serve election notices to take petroleum under the participation agreements to ensure that, combined with royalty oil, it manages or trades at any time not less than 250,000 barrels a day."</p></blockquote>
We estimate that within five years we shall need a percentage of participation oil in addition to royalty oil to maintain the minimum base load with which it would make sense for the agency to have its own trading section. Amendment No. 46 provides an important base line, although in my view the amount specified is not sufficient to provide security of supplies, which is why I tabled amendment No. 47. Amendment No. 46 uses the basis upon which even Ministers agree. Royalty oil plays a part in our security of oil supplies. It will decline fairly dramatically. Therefore, to reinforce the security of our supplies, at least to the minimal level, which even the Government accept, we must top up royalty oil with a certain amount of participation oil. I hope that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland—if not other Members of the Committee—will support me on that.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support me, too, on amendment No. 33 which would insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that in respect of the activities on behalf of the Crown with respect to petroleum the Agency shall enter agreements with the oil companies to receive all the royalty oil for not less than three years."</p></blockquote>
Let me explain the significance of that proviso. In 1986, royalty oil will provide the agency with about 270,000 barrels a day to manage and trade. But under the present arrangements 170,000 barrels of that will be subject to automatic saleback to big companies such as Shell and Esso. In the past, those companies have enjoyed the right to take oil back as a matter of course. They have enjoyed automatic royalty saleback arrangements similar to the participation saleback
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
arrangements. I cited Shell and Esso because they are the most obvious but I suspect that BP and Texaco may have enjoyed the right, too.<br><br>
There would be almost no point—I could join forces with Conservative Back Benchers on this—in establishing the agency's right as the manager of royalty oil if it ended up involved in the automatic saleback of 170,000 of the 270,000 barrels available. The agency might well choose to sell that oil back to the big companies' refineries, but we believe that it should have the right to decide whether to do so. It should be able to decide the destination of the royalty oil. If we allow automatic saleback on the present scale, the agency will be a minimalist and rather worthless trading organisation, even in the business of trading and managing the royalty oil.<br><br>
I hope that we can carry the Government with us on the principle, if not the wording of the amendment, which provides that the agency would not necessarily sign the automatic sell-backs. That mattered less when BNOC was trading in a large amount of participation oil, because the sum total of oil available to the corporation at any moment was large enough to make some difference to the market and to our security of supply. It will certainly be necessary for the agency to maintain its options over all royalty-in-kind oil, and to decide how much of the oil to which it is entitled should be sold back to the major refiners.<br><br>
The amendment ensures that all the oil will go to the agency; it will then be for the agency to decide what to do with it. There should be no automatic sell-back arrangements. Will the Minister, having given a number of policy statements relating to the agency's activities, now make a simple policy statement to the effect that the agency will not be expected to sign automatic saleback arrangements of the traditional kind with the large oil companies? If not, the agency will become impotent as an oil trader.<br><br>
The other value of the word oil will become relevant when we discuss amendments No. 34 and No. 35. At that point we shall look at the way in which royalty oil is lifted and accrued. I shall therefore not stray into a discussion of amendment No. 34.<br><br>
I must, however, wander into the other major amendment in the group—No. 47. It deals with a different, but related issue. The amendment describes the kind of participation rights that should be exercised by the agency, and puts two propositions to the Government. The first is that the agency should exercise participation rights to the tune of 25—not 51—per cent. We are being modest because we seek a compromise with the Minister and the Government. We suggest that that 25 per cent might be a reasonable basis on which to give the agency a significant, though not outrageous, role in trading in participation oil.<br><br>
Alternatively, we have been flexible enough to leave open an option for the agency, after consulting the Secretary of State, not to take 25 per cent of participation oil across the board, but to take the full 51 per cent in certain appropriate fields, to produce a balanced market arrangement. In some oilfields, it would make sense for the agency not to exercise any participation rights at present, but to keep them in abeyance. In others, it would make sense to exercise the full 51 per cent rights.<br><br>
I throw out some ideas: it would make sense, judging
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
from current BNOC practice, to exercise the full 51 per cent right in the Forties Brae field. Again, on the fields that make up the Ninian blend there may be a case for exercising the full 51 per cent right. That applies also to Brent, which is being worked by the Conoco, Gulf and Demiuex companies, and to Statfjord. There is a strong strategic case to be made for the latter field, as that is where the border with the Norwegians is, and we should exercise our full national rights when close to, and co-operating with our Norwegian partners in the development of those fields.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 47 leaves the option open and we suggest that the agency should immediately exercise a percentage of the participation rights, either on a straight 25 per cent basis or by a participation agreement exercising 51 per cent rights in certain fields. Since the beginning of the year, I have not understood why BNOC did not adopt that course in the first place. Why did BNOC not move in relation to price?<br><br>
As a member of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) questioned both the Minister and officials and I remember a particular line of questioning that he took which was pursued by a number of other members of the Select Committee. He asked why BNOC did not reduce its exposure, first, by moving to a market-rated price and, secondly, by reducing at least a percentage of the volume of oil in which it is trading by not exercising a percentage of its participation rights.<br><br>
That seemed to me to be a perfectly reasonable compromise between abolishing BNOC and allowing it to adjust to existing market circumstances. I thought that that was what members of the Select Committee were moving towards and the hon. Member for Rochford nods in assent. Therefore, he should be attracted to amendment No. 47 which suggests that the agency might have a base of exercising participation oil rights on either a 25 per cent basis or by the exercise of a 51 per cent right in relation to certain oilfields when it makes commercial and strategic sense to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that particular line of questioning in the Select Committee was pursued on the understanding that BNOC would stay in being. It was a way of trying to move it further towards an acceptable framework. When the Select Committee heard that BNOC was no longer to exist, it was more pleased with that decision than it would have been had its proposals been accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was a member of the Select Committee and I was not, but he has no right to say that that would have been the view of the Select Committee. After all, that view was not given in its findings. Indeed, the whole burden of the evidence was for the maintenance, not the abolition, of BNOC. Therefore, I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman should put words into the collective mouth of the Select Committee, although he is entitled to say that that was his own view.<br><br>
I was saying that a perfectly reasonable compromise was possible. BNOC could have reduced its exposure and one way of doing so could have been for it to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
follow the line that I am suggesting. Before the Minister came to the irrevocable decision to abolish BNOC, did he suggest that to BNOC? Why did he not prompt the corporation to consider it? Did BNOC ever listen to such arguments and issues? It would have made sense as a means of maintaining BNOC and, certainly, as a base load for the new agency.<br><br>
We have argued that we believe that a state organisation, whether it be BNOC or the agency, needs to exercise participation rights, combined with managing royalty-in-kind oil, to provide sufficient oil to ensure the security of our supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman goes on to deal with more general matters, amendment No. 46 refers to 250,000 barrels a day, which I believe he said was a somewhat conservative estimate of what might be a necessary minimum. Amendment No. 47 refers to the maximum security of oil supplies to the United Kingdom. Will he tell us what he means by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"the maximum security of oil supplies"?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that our security of oil supplies was at its most effective when BNOC was trading 700,000 or 800,000 barrels a day net of sale-back. But I am trying to reach a compromise. I am trying to make a pragmatic gesture by saying to the Government, "BNOC's past activities—caused so much offence that you have recommended the corporations' abolition. But let us find a compromise. Let us at least agree on a base load."<br><br>
I have worked on the Minister's assumption that royalty oil means something, and have assumed that it accounts for 250,000 to 280,000 barrels a day, so that even on the Minister's argument, the agency should be trading that amount. In addition, I have suggested in amendment No. 47 that 25 per cent of the existing 1.3 million barrels a day—at present levels, about 300,000 barrels a day—would be a good participation oil base load for the new agency.<br><br>
The agency would then be trading or managing about 500,000 barrels a day, taking participation and royalty oil together. That would be a sensible basis on which to operate. It would give the agency enough oil to develop expertise and skill and to mean something both in terms of the market and in terms of security of supply. Furthermore, the amendments would allow the agency enough flexibility to control the destinations of a percentage of our oil.<br><br>
On Second Reading the Under-Secretary made bizarre observations to the effect that BNOC had done next to nothing in the summer of 1979. If the Minister of State chooses to base his remarks on that argument, I shall take it apart in detail; I have made a detailed analysis of the 1979 crisis and of the role that BNOC played. One needs to trade in a volume of oil sufficient to allow one to switch a percentage of that oil back into one's own market at any time. That is where the balance of national interest and good trading practice lies.<br><br>
If we accept the Government's arrangement's for the agency, which depend almost exclusively on the dramatically declining royalty oil, the agency will be in no position to act as we suggest that it should. Amendment No. 47 would give the agency that opportunity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0172">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
by allowing it to combine a measure of royalty oil with a really decent percentage of participation oil to form a sufficient basic volume of oil—both traded and managed—to enable it to influence supplies at any given time.<br><br>
We believe that the Government are in danager of creating a lame duck—a worthless agency whose trading division will have trade in declining royalty oil. The agency will not provide us with sufficient security of supply unless it is allowed to pursue the combination of policies set out in the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I approached the amendments without much sympathy at first, although the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has spoken to them eloquently and reasonably persuasively. 1 object to them more on practical and technical grounds than on points of principle.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will recall that I did not share his view of the Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Bill; we disagreed over royalty-in-kind oil. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that the amount of such oil could well diminish. However, those of us who supported that Bill feel that we have been rewarded to some extent by the exploration and development that has taken place in the United Kingdom continental shelf as a result of the legislation. As my constituency depends on that considerably, I believe that my support was justified.<br><br>
During the passage of that Bill I agreed strongly with what the hon. Member for Erewash (Mr. Rost) said. If a crisis developed, the House would be well equipped to meet it, and legislation in that respect would not be delayed unduly. My understanding of this Bill is that the new agency will be able to enter into similar participation agreements and therefore elect to deal in oil.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 40, 43, 52 and 53 show why we should not reply on paper participation agreements which have not been activated in any way. When we reach those amendments, I shall explain why that is not an effective way of securing supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the hon. Gentleman's point. Nevertheless, I still believe that such participation agreements could contain a provision allowing the agency to elect to take oil, and that those agreements could be activated. I do not want to go into great detail about the IEA, although I feel that perhaps its arrangements for coping with crises are probably better now than they were in 1979.<br><br>
I have a slight technical criticism. It is necessary to make a judgment about exactly what security of supply is needed, but it may not be necessary to be as precise about the figures as the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is in some of his amendments. However, that is not a matter of fundamental opposition between us. I wonder whether empowering the new agency to trade in and manage so much oil is altogether wise.<br><br>
Although the amendments are couched in terms of security of supply, it may be that their real purpose—by a back-door tactic—is to defeat the whole object of the Bill, and to have a British National Oil Corporation trading under a different name—perhaps with less oil,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
but carrying on much the same activities as before and making considerable losses. At least twice in the past 18 months, the House had to vote additional funds for the corporation, as matters were going out of control.<br><br>
We do not oppose the Bill, although we feel that it was regrettable that, through the hiving off of what became Britoil, the nation lost active participation in North Sea oil development. But that is now history. In effect, BNOC had almost lost its core function and was not serving a worthwhile purpose; that was at considerable cost to the taxpayer. Therefore, we view with some suspicion any move that may give a kiss of life to BNOC.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Minister should tell us what he regards as the agency's role; the amendments are a good means of focusing on that. Clause 2 speaks of the agency's general functions, but it is not clear what its general objectives are. We understand that one of them is to manage royalty-in-kind oil. Do the Government regard such oil as being principally for security of supply, or are we considering merely another form of taxation? Is that the major function?<br><br>
If the answer is security of supply, the Minister has a duty to tell the Committee the sort of level that he considers necessary to maintain it to tell the Committee what sort of level he considers necessary to maintain it and whether he feels that it will be maintained under present arrangements for the next five to 10 years.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
By virtue of the fact that the agency receives oil by means of royalty in kind, it has a statutory power to buy, sell and otherwise deal in petroleum on its own account. The Committee would like to know what parameters the Secretary of State sets out as a matter of policy for that trading. Is it to be the same basis on which the BNOC traded in oil? To what extent will he have to abide by the type of arrangement made in participation agreements? Can the Minister tell the Committee what guidance will be given to the agency regarding its trading? Will it have a totally free hand, or will the Government use it as a means of setting a price that they wish to see? Because the agency will trade and deal in oil, the Committee has a right to know the thinking behind it. The Minister's answers may have some bearing on whether the amendments that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney tabled are worthy of support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to make a lengthy speech, although I want the Committee to appreciate that the detailed and well-informed speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) is a proper reflection of the considerable importance of this group of amendments. They will be seen as important as not many years pass.<br><br>
The Minister will appreciate the relevance of my argument, because we saw him, with his usual cheerful demeanour, on television the other day, celebrating the anniversary of the Argyll field. It is perhaps appropriate that national attention should be paid to that anniversary and to 10 years of enormously rapid development, technological achievement, and so on.<br><br>
Another anniversary may fall due but the Minister has not noticed it. Any day now, the Forties field will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0173">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
produce its 200th million tonne of oil. Recoverable reserves were estimated by the operator in the Forties field, our biggest field—no doubt the Minister will confirm that we shall not find one the size of Forties again—at 270 million tonnes, and if the Minister checks with the Department he will find that that enormous resource will be extracted any day.<br><br>
It is therefore right that the House should begin to look at the arrangements made by the nation and set them in the context of the depletion rate currently mentioned. Many people, including some outside my party, are anxious about the extremely rapid rate of depletion. The case has not yet been properly answered by the Government, who, in their haste to extract oil, have not necessarly served the national interest in terms of guaranteeing a proper pace of extraction, ensuring that the pace does not go ahead so quickly that tertiary recovery is belatedly possible, ensuring that the national industrial interest is served, or making sure—through the operation of an organisation such as BNOC—that there is sufficient capacity in the hands of the state to intervene in the market to control supply and to guarantee that adequate and sensible trading arrangements have been made.<br><br>
Apart from making the relevant point about Forties, which is by far our biggest field from which by far the bulk of reserves has already been taken, I am wondering whether Conservative Members have remembered to bring with them the Departments' report for 1985.<br><br>
I will not burden the Committee by referring to every oilfield in the North sea. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) made fulsome reference to some of those details. This is an important matter, and if Conservative Members are the slightest bit interested in it, they should look at appendix 6 of the 1985 report, and in particular at the first 10 fields listed there. Although they are the first 10 alphabetically, they are a satisfactory example of the spread and type of fields that we, as a country, own. They are: Argyll, Auk, Beatrice, Beryl, Brent, South Brae, Buchan, Claymore, North Cormorant and South Cormorant. Some of them are small; Brent, however, is one of our largest fields, and we may not find its like again.<br><br>
The reserves estimated by the operators of the fields—and I believe that their estimates are endorsed by the Department—stood at a little over 400 million tonnes. By the end of 1984, 195—almost 200—million tonnes had gone, and any day now we shall pass the halfway mark of those 10 fields' reserves. Our resources are being rapidly depleted. We are concerned that the Bill will diminish the capacity of the state to intervene, and the capacity of BNOC to serve the national interest. The eagerness of Conservative hon. Members to see that capacity further dismantled is rather sad.<br><br>
My hon. Friend posed several important questions—I do not know whether all hon. Members of the Committee paid attention to them—to which the country and this Committee should attend. I hope that when the Bill returns to the House, as it unfortunately will, the House will be properly informed of the cogent, powerful and necessary arguments advanced by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
My hon. Friend said little about amendment No. 41,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
which relates to the need for BNOC to charge the proper fees. Conservative hon. Members have always been eager to see the nationalised public sector as the milch cow for private enterprise, whether it is a case of the National Coal Board being robbed by people wanting generous payments for mining subsidence, or people jumping on the oil bandwagon; or whatever. But even Conservative Members will have to confess—at least in public—that my hon. Friend is entirely justified in trying to ensure by means of the amendment that the agency is entitled to ask for a proper reward for its services. Even hon. Members who lust after privatisation cannot expect the taxpayer and the state to provide a facility that will render services for nothing. That is not how the monetarist ethic operates.<br><br>
Even if the Government cannot change their ways and reject their record of rash negligence, they should at least be consistent and allow the agency to charge proper fees.<br><br>
I will not burden the Committee with further remarks on the amendment, except to confirm that Opposition Members believe the amendments to be so important that there will be a vote on them, unless we see such a belated conversion of the Minister as will arouse howls of anguish from his hon. Friends. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend and I have been in the House for too long to be able to believe in such a virtuous conversion of any Minister in this Administration.<br><br>
The Minister will have an appalling job convincing even some of his hon. Friends that the amendments lack merit, and I shall listen with great attention to learn whether there is any possibility of the Minister presenting an argument against the amendments strong enough to convince the Opposition. If there are Conservative Members who have thought seriously about the matter, perhaps they, too, will need a great deal of convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like first to deal with a matter of fundamental importance which affects how the amendments, and especially amendment No. 33, would apply. I shall comment on the general background so that the Committee is under no misconception as to what we are debating, and deal, as I have done with past amendments, with the spirit of the amendment, because a misconception appears to lie behind it.<br><br>
Decisions on whether royalty should be taken in kind have never been, and are not now, made by BNOC, nor will they in the future be made by the agency. The ability to take royalty in kind derives from the model clauses, which embody the terms on which licences to produce oil are granted. For rounds I to 7, model clause 11 enables the Minister to serve a notice requiring a licensee to deliver petroleum in place of royalty in cash. Legally, the Minister cannot delegate the discretion conferred on him by this provision. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to require the agency to be responsible for entering into agreements with licensees which stipulated the period for which royalty in kind would be taken, nor would it be appropriate for licensees to enter into such agreements, since
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0174">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
they have no control over the periods for which royalty in kind is taken.<br><br>
I do not make that observation to undermine the spirit of what the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said, but it might be thought misleading if I had not made that point absolutely clear. I may be anticipating an intervention by the hon. Gentleman, but it would be possible for the Secretary of State to make known the period of years for which he might wish royalty in kind to be taken. However, that would not be appropriate, and I am moving more on to the substance than the mechanics of the amendment. I believe that it would fetter the Secretary of State's discretion under model clause 11, and I shall return to this point later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it might be possible to overcome the problem in regard to amendment No. 33 if a sort of manuscript amendment were to provide that the agency should have the power to enter agreements. We seek merely to add a proviso to the power that is given in clause 2(1). Would that satisfy the Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should wait and hear the substance of my remarks before doing that. In Committee I have heard many arguments from Governments of different persuasions in dealing with the spirit of an amendment, which is what I want to deal with. When all else fails, it is said that the amendment does not apply because it is defective, and so on. I prefer to start the other way round by making the basis of the amendment clear. I also wish to make it clear that I am not keen for the Secretary of State's powers, especially under the model clauses, to be fettered in the way that the amendment proposes, even though I might accept its spirit.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me two specific questions relating to the quantity of royalty in kind and gave a full exposition from the calculations that he had made. It is of the order of 250,000 barrels a day at present. For a reason which I do not intend to repeat, so as not to weary the Committee, it will decline towards the end of the decade and average, over the decade, about 200,000 barrels daily. A simple deduction shows that, towards the end of the decade, we shall have about 150,000 barrels a day. I emphasise that absolutely firm predictions cannot be made. The Department and Ministers of successive Governments have never made precise predictions; they are always within a broad range. But the figures that I have mentioned would be within the range that I expect. I hope that that is helpful to the hon. Gentleman. It simply confirms the information that he gave.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me specifically about sale-back. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State made an absolutely specific commitment on the matter of Second Reading, and that commitment stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has the advantage of having the Second Reading proceedings before him, but I have not. Can he repeat the Parliamentary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
Under-Secretary's commitment, because I was not satisfied?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be less thorough than usual in that his homework is normally excellent, but on this occasion I am perfectly prepared to help him. My hon. Friend said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I assure him..—</p></blockquote>
that is, the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands)—
<br><blockquote><p>"that there is no commitment on either BNOC or the agency to sell back to the producers any royalty in kind in oil that licensees produce." —<i>[Official Report, 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, col. 253.]</i></p></blockquote>
That was the commitment made and I repeat it today.<br><br>
The real substance of the hon. Gentleman's remarks referred to the question of security of supply, which I should like to deal with again. In the event of a crisis, what matters more than anything else is access to the products of crude oil, because it is the products market on which industry and the private citizen depend. That, of course, is where the relevance of the informal agreements lies. I emphasise again "informal" and make no apology for it.<br><br>
Unusually for the hon. Gentleman—I think that it was due to the speed with which he was speaking—he was mistaken. Here again, those informal agreements are not related across the board to all oil companies that produce oil in the North sea. They deal with products and therefore with the refining companies. Those agreements which exist, and for which assurance has been received, are from refining companies.<br><br>
In order to be helpful and not in trying to brush off any debate on the subject, I said on Second Reading that I would see whether it was possible to give further information on our informal agreements, but I am afraid that it is not possible. They are commercially confidential. Indeed, the exact terms of the agreements vary in detail from company to company. But I repeat, as I think was said on Second Reading, that the general thrust of the agreements is that in the absence of any international sharing agreements—to which we are bound by treaty—being triggered off, the refining companies will honour their commitments to their United Kingdom customers.<br><br>
It is not possible to write in any legal exactitude even if it was desirable to do so, because obviously only an informal understanding can cater for the millions of customers who, for example, fill up at service stations, but have no supply contract. I repeat that without such informal understandings, access to participation oil is useless, because one cannot be certain that it will reach the customer in the form of a product. That is what matters in the end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly we cannot expect the Minister to give details of a confidential commercial contract. But will he consider giving the House a little more information on Report, and will he at least assure the Committee that the Government have arrangements that they regard as satisfactory with all the major refining interests in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have examined the possibility of providing further information on this subject, but I confirm that because of the nature of the matter, I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0175">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
neither able nor prepared to do so. On the hon. Gentleman's second point, I believe that we have satisfactory arrangements with all the refining interests in the country.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney made it quite clear that security of supply in a crisis was his primary concern. On Second Reading, I described the different arrangements that existed. The one that I have just described is the most important for the consumer. I do not intend to rehearse all the details, but as I said the UK is treaty-bound by all the international agreements so that in the event of a major disruption we can invoke them. With crude oil, we have the power to invoke the participation agreements, although as has been freely acknowledged, they cannot be activated until a certain period has elapsed.<br><br>
In the interim, we have access to royalty-in-kind oil, which at present levels would amount to about 25,000 barrels a day.<br><br>
I repeat that royalty in kind oil gives us a modest additional security of supply. We are talking about crude oil rather than products, and the retention of the power—useful though it may be—is not therefore of fundamental importance to security of supply. I have always acknowledged that the power would extinguish itself. But let us keep that advantage in the interim. It also gives us—and, again, I should like to see how this works—a modest advantage in that it allows transparency of price, although I believe that the Inland Revenue will be able to prepare a reference price for tax purposes perfectly well.<br><br>
For those two reasons—the modest security of supply and the modest advantage of transparency of pricing—I and the Government concluded that this was not worth changing by means of the Bill and could be continued under the new agency.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 33, we shall be better able to judge the effectiveness of the agency in dealing with royalty-in-kind oil once it has begun operations. The amendment should be rejected if the hon. Gentleman presses it because, as I suggested earlier, the restriction would have to be put on the Secretary of State rather than on the agency, and the amendment would result in an undesirable loss of flexibility in determining how best to collect royalty revenue.<br><br>
The Government have no current intention of stopping the agency taking royalty in kind. We may well want to continue taking it for three years, or even for a longer period. However, the structure of the oil market is such that it is difficult to predict and write into legislation a precise period in which something should be stopped or continued. The amendment would require royalty oil to be traded in kind for as long as it lasts, unless the Government were prepared to override such contractual provisions. It is preferable to preserve our flexibility for the future, and that is why the amendment should be rejected.<br><br>
I find it difficult to follow how exactly amendment No. 41 would be applied. The words "no less advantageous" beg the question to whom the fees should be no less advantageous. The principle that we should folow in determining the fees for disposing of royaltyin-kind oil should be that the agency receives the minimum necessary to encourage and maintain an effi
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
cient trading service. I should prefer to leave it to the agency's managers to decide what organisation they require to dispose of oil. It is for them to propose fees accordingly, and it is for the Government to negotiate with the agency on the basis of the criteria that I have suggested. A comparison with the size of BNOC's fees is only of incidental relevance. The Government have a responsibility to avoid unnecessary public expenditure, so I hope that Opposition Members will not pursue the amendment.<br><br>
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) in his short speech to the effect that the question of fees is an important one, but I prefer to leave it to the agency to negotiate them.<br><br>
Amendment No. 46 would have the gradual effect of requiring the re-exercising of participation options, so that the volume of oil traded by the agency remained above 250,000 barrels a day. That would imbue an arbitrary figure with a significance that I find difficult to justify. I understand the hon. Gentleman's motive in tabling the amendment; he wishes to retain a significant public sector involvement in the market. I do not understand how it can be argued that trading around a figure of, say, 5 per cent., 20 per cent. or 10 per cent.—the figure required by the amendment—is necessarily appropriate. It would be much better to trade the required volume, which brings us back to the amount of royalty-in-kind oil delivered to the Secretary of State. In that respect, I hope that flexibility will be retained.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
Amendment No. 47 would put the responsibility for the security of supply on the agency, instead of leaving it with the Secretary of State. It remains open to the Government, if a world shortage of crude oil supplies exists or is threatened, to reactivate the participation agreements. That would provide at least four times as much oil as is available under royalty in kind.<br><br>
However, my main reason for opposing amendment No. 47 appears to be the same as that of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland. If the agency traded in oil under the terms of participation agreements, it would be obliged to propose term prices to its suppliers and customers. Inevitably, they would become known as the United Kingdom official prices.<br><br>
That underlines the remarks of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. Even in the present transitional period, before the transfer from BNOC to the agency has been effected, the corporation's operations have been misrepresented to some extent. That shows the dangers which may be contained in the amendment.<br><br>
Since April, BNOC has proposed prices to individual suppliers for oil to be lifted in the month. But the prices are based on those agreed on the sale of that oil. Therefore it is utterly misleading to describe the results of that procedure as United Kingdom official prices. The price proposals are made some weeks behind the actual market, rather than being a new development on it; they are hardly news to the market. BNOC's present proposals are really a matter of history, more than anything else. I hope that members of the Committee are not misled either in that respect or about the amendment's possible effects.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the right hon. Gentleman spoke about royalty oil, he said that a minor advantage of retaining the system was that transparency of price is useful for Inland Revenue purposes. But might not the fact that the agency will continue to trade in oil also have the effect of setting what could be taken as a United Kingdom official price?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is that danger, but I should like to see what experience shows us about this. After all, the Secretary of State is able to adjust the agreements or to disengage from them. We should bear it in mind that we are discussing an agency—no more, and no less. It will merely be selling on the Government's behalf the oil obtained from the royaltyin-kind provisions, not trading in oil on its own account.<br><br>
I believe that we would be wise to reject the amendment, as there could be precisely the same problems for the agency as those experienced by BNOC. A role and influence is being attributed to the corporation on its selling policy that it does not seek or have. For that reason, amendment No. 47 should be rejected, and I cannot recommend the other amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this the same person who gave evidence on 6 March to the Select Committee on Energy regarding the role of BNOC a week before this announcement? Is it the same man or an illusion? Has the Minister undergone a curious experience in less than a couple of months? With circumstances not very different, he is now overturning the arguments that he put, quite eloquently, to the Select Committee in defence of BNOC's role in securing supplies, acting as a oil tax reference point and, indeed, in influencing market prices, although we did not share that view. In addition, he said that it was managing royalty-in-kindoil on behalf of the nation. Is this the same person who on 6 March made that cogent and coherent case who now stands those arguments and himself on their heads? We are not willing to undergo the curious metamorphosis through which he has passed, so we do not find the case which the Minister made against the spirit of the amendments persuasive in any way.<br><br>
Even if I do not take the Minister back to 6 March, let me remind him of what he said on 13 March, after the decision between Millbank and this House to abolish BNOC from taking place. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government consider it essential to retain powers that would enhance security of supply if that proved to be necessary. We will therefore retain the participation agreements themselves so that we can activate them to have access to these oil supplies should the need arise. We will also retain the arrangements under which we have the power to receive oil from continental shelf licensees as royalty in kind. Those two factors together mean that security of supply will continue to be safeguarded." —<i>[Official Report,</i> 13 March 1985; Vol. 75, c. 305.]</p></blockquote>
Those twin pillars provided the security of our oil supplies. We shall debate the role which dormant participation agreements are to have in securing our oil supplies when we reach amendment No. 40, but we are now debating the second factor mentioned in col. 305 that would help to safeguard them. The Minister did not deny it at the time, but he has now admitted that one of the two factors that safeguard the security of our oil supplies—rotating royalty in kind oil—will decline
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
in fairly dramatic fashion within five years. He said that royalty-in-kind oil willfall in five years' time from more than 250,000 barrels a day—I thought that it would be higher in 1986—to 150,000 barrels a day. If taking royalty-in-kind oil makes a contribution to the security of our oil supplies and the supply of oil declines, the logical answer to that equation is that there will be less security of our oil supplies when royalty-in-kind oil declines. Therefore, a booster is needed to bring up the level of the amount in which the agency will trade. That is why we chose a figure of 250,000 barrels a day of royalt-in-kind oil.<br><br>
We accepted the Minister's remark, that one of the two factors that safeguarded the security of oil supplies was taking royalty-in-kind oil. We accepted that 250,000 barrels a day is the current rate of that oil, but we are now told that although it may decline it will make no difference. Of course it will make a difference. Either the statement reported in col. 305 was right and the Minister is now wrong, or he should confess and accept at least the thrust of amendment No. 47.<br><br>
The other argument which he trotted out was that products are more important than control of the destination of crude oil. We cannot have products unless there is crude oil in the refineries. In 1979—I am happy to go into detail because the Minister has trotted out the same argument—BNOC helped to stablise the market in some respects by trading crude oil to which it had participation rights, and even exported some of it in return for fuel oil and other products to be brought back into the British market to meet the need of the time.<br><br>
Let me illustrate that point for the Minister. In 1979, BNOC traded abroad its own crude oil over which it had control for fuel oil exchanges under the exercise of participation rights to prod the CEGB, which at the time was burning a percentage of fuel oil. We saw last winter the consequences in expenditure terms of the CEGB going to the international market to buy large quantities of fuel oil irrespective of the cost. I know that you will not allow me to get into arguments about the miners' strike, Mr. Knox I see that I have your approval in that respect. In 1979, we saw how a measure of control over crude oil supplies can be traded off for provision of fuel oil and other products. Many times during 1979, BNOC used its possession and ownership of crude oil, taken under participation rights, to trade in certain products. There is therefore close interraction between the provision of crude oil supplies and the availability of products. The right hon. Gentleman must make a clear distinction: one has either crude oil or products.<br><br>
If there is control over a percentage of crude oil at a time of shortage, that bargaining power can be used not only to serve refineries, directly but to use the crude oil to trade off for products with other companies in other countries. The importance of the case for controlling some crude oil supplies is not therefore undermined.<br><br>
We did not find the Minister's arguments convincing. The thrust of our amendment, despite drafting defects, is aimed at ensuring that the agency will have the power and a sufficient supply of crude oil to be able to influence market supply in times of shortage. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0177">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
Minister's description of the agency and its roles restricts it to trading in minimum royalty oil in kind, although clause 2 gives it the power to do many other things, and his policy statements are to that effect. We tried to override the Secretary of State's responsibilities, discretions and rights to give the agency a good base from which to start and to work. Because of the way in which the Minister rejected our amendments, I have no alternative but to ask my hon. Friends to support me by pressing the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. It has been interesting to have both the Minister and the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) say how much they want me to go along with them. I cannot wait for them to hold the balance of power.<br><br>
I said that I had serious misgivings about the amendment, and especially about the way in which it sought to resurrect BNOC by the back door. Perhaps the Minister can answer two questions. He said that in time of crisis it was important to have fuel oil in a place where it could be used by the consumer. I understand that if there is no petrol in the pumps in Shetland, it is small consolation that one million barrels a day are going through Sullom Voe. That does little good if one cannot get petrol at the pumps.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
Nevertheless, does not he think that there is some advantage—and, if he does, how much—in having access to crude oil? There is clearly a finite amount of oil available for refining at a given time, especially in a crisis, and if the nation has access to crude oil which it can channel through the refineries at a later date, is not that advantageous?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney spoke of the amount of trading and the advantageous negotiating position that it can give us if we need access to crude oil. Perhaps the Minister can expand a little more on the informal arrangements. I should like to know at what point they begin. He used the phrase "major dislocation". Can he say whether what we experienced in 1979 amounted to the sort of dislocation that would trigger off the informal arrangements? If he could satisfy me on those points, I would feel disposed to support him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, the security of supply is important, as witness the participation agreements which retain the powers. In the short term, until they can become effective, there are other powers. The informal assurances exist all the time. That obligation on refining companies is there constantly.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move admendment No. 34, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that in carrying out activities in relation to the Crown's petroleum, the Agency shall have the right to lift oil in accordance with the arrangements currently in force for the field in question with regard to frequency and pattern of lifting, including the accrual and aggregation of any oil as though it were an equity partner".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take admendment No. 35, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that in carrying out activities on behalf of the Crown in relation to petroleum the Agency shall, where it considers it desirable and consistent with and capable of enhancing the performance of its duties to handle royalty oil, purchase additional oil and sell or exchange it as desirable".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We move from a debate on the principle of amendments to a debate of a more technical nature, to argue about detailed considerations of the way in which the agency will undertake its activities under the powers given to it by the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 34 attempts to ensure that the agency will be able to carry out a practice which commercial operators and people with equity interests in the North sea, who trade in oil on a day-to-day, weekto-week or month-to-month, cargo-to-cargo basis use, and give it the power to accrue the royalty oil to which it will be entitled by the most effective and secure method possible.<br><br>
Amendment No. 35 follows a point made by the Minister on Second Reading which would allow the agency to collect additional oil if it enhanced in any way the handling and managing of royalty oil.<br><br>
I will explain the background to both amendments. As I understand it, BNOC trades in participation oil with participation rights, and manages royalty oil on behalf of the Crown. BNOC's standard method of handling the two has not been to keep them separate but to take them from wherever it is entitled to take them and aggregate and accrue enough oil to build up a cargo or cargoes. It has thereby maximised its efficiency in collecting, managing and trading royalty and participation oil. That system creates a more viable operation: BNOC does not have to pick up small quantities of oil which would not make up a whole cargo.<br><br>
In other words, when BNOC charters a tanker which calls in at Sullom Voe or Flotta, or Hand Point, it wants to take as much as it is entitled to, in order to make up a sensible commercial cargo. It has been possible for BNOC to do that because of the quantities of oil with which it has been dealing. It has had enough royalty and participation oil to be able frequently to make up a successful commercial cargo. That makes good shipping sense, lifting sense and commercial sense.<br><br>
The agency will have to do the same thing with far
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0178">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
less right to oil, and without participation oil. It will have to pick up small amounts of royalty oil, so the amendment would give the agency the power to do a deal with the other operators in an oilfield or terminal, and to underlift or overlift the amount of its entitlement of royalty oil at that time. That will enable it to make up a cargo, thereby rendering the operation more efficient and viable.<br><br>
BNOC had the opportunity to aggregate its oil entitlement by mixing cargoes of participation and royalty oil, together with commercial oil that it was allowed to buy under exising provisions. BNOC can collect oil from three sources: on behalf of the Crown, it has the right to royalty oil; under participation rights it has participation oil; thirdly, it has been allowed to increase its cargoes by buying oil commercially from other companies.<br><br>
The aggregation of oil, using those three rights, has been skilfully done by BNOC. The new agency, which will still manage, trade, lift and ship royalty oil, will not—unless we establish its rights to do so—have the right to collect sufficient oil to build up cargoes in the same way as BNOC. How do the Minister and the Department see the agency functioning when it will often find itself entitled only to small portions of oil?<br><br>
Even BNOC has had occasional difficulties in getting its true entitlement of royalty oil; but the new agency will face a greater problem than BNOC in that respect. In certain periods, it will be entitled only to small amounts of oil that will not be sufficient to make up a cargo.<br><br>
In amendments Nos. 34 and 35 we suggest ways of tackling the problem, which derives from royalty rights. At present, the conditions governing the right to take royalty oil mean that the Secretary of State has the right to do so only within a chargeable six-month period. If BNOC does not collect all that it is entitled to within that period, it is not allowed to roll over that portion of royalty oil; the royalty would be paid in cash, not in kind. But that is less of a problem to BNOC, as it can use its other oil rights to make up a decent cargo, and it does not often lose its entitlement to collect royalty oil from any particular company.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the problem of the six-month chargeable period will become much greater when the agency trades in royalty oil. It will often find itself—it should be borne in mind where some of the royalty oil is, as well as the percentages involved in each field—unable within that period to collect all the royalty-in-kind oil to which it is entitled, and it may default on that collection. But clearly it will be paid in cash later; there is a time factor in this respect. For the agency's trading in and management of the royalty oil, the six-month chargeable period could be a major problem. That is the principle behind amendment No. 34.<br><br>
I have never understood why we cannot have a system similar to that of the Norwegians, who do not have such a strict period. They have built up a royalty system by which they can collect the oil even in a rollover period—that is, three months outside the six-month chargeable period. Perhaps the Minister will explain why we cannot adopt a similar practice in respect of the North sea. The Norwegians organise matters very sensibly; such a provision would be ex
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
tremely helpful for the agency. After all, occasionally in a six-month period it will have insufficient entitlement to royalty oil to justify its collecting it and making it up into a cargo. I hope that we can have a more flexible way of collecting royalty oil.<br><br>
A way out of the difficulty would be to accept amendment No. 35, which would allow the agency to collect small portions of oil on a commercial basis. Combined with its royalty oil, that could be built up into a proper cargo for shipping; it would be a most efficient way of dealing with the problem. An average oil tanker cargo from the North sea is perhaps 60,000 or 70,000 tonnes. Often in a six-month period, the agency will have nothing like the right to royalty oil of 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes.<br><br>
6.45 p.m.<br><br>
Therefore, our amendment No. 35 suggests giving the agency the right to purchase additional oil on a normal commercial basis and to build up the oil that it is entitled to into one decent cargo, thereby making the management of royalty oil more efficient and the whole operation commercially viable.<br><br>
There are a number of operations and fields to which this could apply. I will not go into details now because they depend on the Minister's reply. Certainly the proposal could apply to all the small apportionments and some of the licences, and, for example, to what was known in the trade as the Sword operation where BP sold a small proportion of its Forties field to a significant number of small companies who not only have track royalty oil and participation oil from BNOC, but have sold 100 per cent. of their oil commercially to BNOC. Will the agency be allowed to carry out the same sort of operation that BNOC has been carrying out?<br><br>
I was encouraged when the Secretary of State, while explaining the provisions of clause 2 on Second Reading, said, in connection with royalty oil supplies, that it would obviously be useful if the agency could buy commercial oil when necessary. It is exactly that situation which we have tried to incorporate in amendment No. 35. After my struggles this afternoon to try to persuade the Minister to make a positive response, do I have a hope that he will accept the gist and principle—if not the actual wording—of my amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 34 tabled by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) raises a highly relevant point. I think that he is seeking an assurance from me rather than anything else. He is absolutely right that, when participation trading ceases, in the first place BNOC and then the agency when it takes over will have to consider whether the rights and arrangements which currently exist to cover the lifting of royalty oil are satisfactory in themselves. It is absolutely right to raise this point.<br><br>
It is turns out that the rights in respect of a particular field need to be supplemented, what is required will have to be negotiated with the individual companies concerned. I believe that sufficient goodwill exists between the Government and the oil companies for satisfactory arrangements to be made.<br><br>
I think that only a relatively small number of minor changes will be made in detailed operating agreements. It was implied—if not explicit—in what the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
hon. Gentleman said that the best way is to look at each agreement individually and not to include the kind of blanket provision proposed in the amendment. If such a blanket provision were included, one might subsequently find unintended and unwelcome implications.<br><br>
However, I give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance that, as he hoped, the matter will be approached in a practical, sensible, flexible way. The bill is intended to do that and, I think, will be less rigid than his amendment. He was absolutely right to raise the matter for clarification. There will have to be a certain amount of renegotiation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have interrupted the Minister prematurely. Will he tell us a little about the concept of the roll-over period on the six-month chargeable period in dealing with royalty oil? I think that that would be the simplest answer to the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was intending to deal with that on amendment No. 35, which is more relevant to the matter. I am not trying to duck the issue, but amendments Nos. 37 and 38 deal with clause 2(1)<i>(d)</i> which raises precisely the point about how to deal commercially, efficiently and effectively with royalty oil. I would rather answer the hon. Gentleman's points when we come to those amendments, because clause 2(1)<i>(d)</i> allows the agency the power to
<br><blockquote><p>"buy, sell or otherwise deal in petroleum on its account."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 35 anticipates to some extent the contents of clause 2(1)<i>(d)</i> while going well beyond it. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is inviting the agency to become involved in trading and indeed, speculating, in the oil market. We do not believe that that function is appropriate to the agency. However, as I shall make clear on amendments Nos. 37 and 38, it is likely that a small amount of such trading may be helpful in supporting the agency's handling of royalty-in-kind oil in the very context to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. The hon. Gentleman's point is relevant, but I do not think that the general power that he seeks to write in to clause 2(1)<i>(a)</i> is correct, although I shall be happy to discuss it when we debate amendments to clause 2(1)<i>(d)</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take very long. I thought for a moment that the Minister was about to be helpful. However, his mood changed swiftly. But as he recognises merit in the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, I trust that he will reflect on the matter before Report with a view to improving the Bill. Even if he sees technical difficulties in my hon. Friend's amendment, if he is to be consistent he should return to the matter on Report, perhaps with a view to tabling an appropriate amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that there was merit in the amendment but that I thought that there was merit in having the topic raised so that I could clarify the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's amendment was far
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
preferable to the Minister's clarification, which did not enlighten the Committee at all. Presumably, the Minister will welcome a lengthy Report stage during which we can table further amendments to secure a further clarification of the points so persuasively presented by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Opposition Members would certainly like to express their view by voting in strong support of amendment No. 35.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the beginning, I thought that I would be grateful to the Minister for the spirit in which he responded to amendment No. 34. I do not agree with his explanation of the whole question of handling royalty oil—involving the six month chargeable period and the roll-over suggestion. That is not an illicit suggestion, Mr. Knox, but a shorthand term used to describe the process of carrying over rights into the period after six months. I am not sure whether the Minister intends to deal with that point when we come to amendments Nos. 37 and 38.<br><br>
I fear that the right hon. Gentleman was unfair to amendment No. 35 in saying that it proposes a great general power. It is not a general power at all. The amendment specifically says:
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that in carrying out activities on behalf of the Crown in relation to petroleum the Agency shall. where it considers it desirable and consistent with and capable of enhancing the performance of its duties to handle royalty oil".</p></blockquote>
It does not say that the agency should go out into the market and buy willy nilly, but proposes that when it finds it necessary to pick up some commercial oil to help it to handle royalty oil, it should have the right to purchase additional oil and sell or exchange it as desirable.<br><br>
I thought that my amendment caught the spirit and meaning of what the Minister said of the agency on Second Reading. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The first purpose is to enable it to maximise the proceeds from the disposal of royalty in kind because, in the course of trading, it may be desirable to do that. The existence of this provision"</p></blockquote>
—that is the provision to allow the agency to buy commercial oil𡀔
<br><blockquote><p>"will, I hope, make it clear that the agency need not be hindered for legal reasons from maximising the proceeds." —<i>[Official Report, 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c.194.]</i></p></blockquote>
In other words, amendment No. 35 says exactly what the Minister said was necessary on Second Reading. Basically, it was a speech in which we found little to disagree with and I found a modest crumb of comfort from the remarks reported in col. 194. I believe that amendment No. 35 fulfils that obligation because it says that to maximise the proceeds from the disposal of royalty oil, the agency should be able to purchase additional oil. I do not believe that the amendment goes further than that.<br><br>
As I have tried, for the first time in the Committee, to meet something that the Minister wanted to achieve, I hope that he will accept amendment No. 35 and, certainly, its spirit.</span></p>

<p>No. 53—a <i>new schedule</i></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p>'PROVISIONS TO BE INCLUDED IN MODEL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS</p>
<p><i>The Agency's rights to crude oil and natural gas liquids</i></p>
<p><i>The Agency's Entitlement</i></p>
<p>1.—In respect of each Commercial Oil Field (COF) the Agency shall, in each election period, be entitled to such proportions as expressed as a percentage not to exceed 51 per cent. of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLS) after taking into account the quantity of any crude oil and natural gas liquids required to be delivered during such election periods to the Secretary of State as royalty in kind.</p>
<p><i>Election notice for crude oil</i></p>
<p>2.—An election notice, given by the Agency in respect of crude oil shall be served on seller and on the operator not less than 30 days before the commencement of the election period to which the election notice relates.</p>
<p><i>Exercise of the Agency's rights to natural gas liquids</i></p>
<p>3.—An election notice given by the Agency in respect of any stream(s), viz.:
<ol>
<li>a stream of Ethane</li>
<li>a stream of propane</li>
<li>a stream of butane</li>
<li>a stream of crude oil</li>
<li>a stream of methane</li>
<li>a mixed stream, being a stream of other than the entire unseparated natural NGLS stream combining in mixed form two or more substances which together constitute the entire unseparated NGLS streams</li></ol>
shall be served on seller and operator not less than 6 months before the commencement of the election period to which the election notice relates.</p>
<p><i>Lifting Arrangements</i></p>
<p>4.—The seller shall use its best endeavours to procure that the arrangements and agreements relating to the offtake, lifting and transportation of petroleum from or attributable to an interest in any COF (including the lifting by and/or delivery to the Agency and including (without limitation) any pipeline or terminal agreement for the use of any facilities up and/or at any actual or prospective point of delivery or point of unloading) shall be negotiated and agreed between seller, the agency and any other relevant parties in the case of COFs not in commercial production as at the date hereof, before the relevant date of commencement of commercial production and in the case of COFs which are in commercial production as at the date hereof, as soon as practicable. Such arrangements and agreements shall be fair and reasonable to the agency seller and other licensees and shall be compatible with the operational requirements of any relevant operating agreement and/or amended operating agreement. To the extent that the consent of third parties is required in order to implement the provisions of such arrangements and agreements, seller shall use its best endeavours to obtain such consent. Where such arrangements or agreements are to be concluded between seller and the agency alone, seller and the agency shall negotiate in good faith in order to conclude such arrangements or agreements. In the case of a COF not in commercial production as at the date hereof, seller shall not agree to such arrangements or agreements unless the agency agrees to the same. If there is more than one delivery system and each licensee may determine the proportion of petroleum attributable to its participating interest which may be taken via each such delivery system then the agency shall have a like right in respect of petroleum to which it is entitled by virtue of an election notice. Seller shall use its best endeavours to ensure that such arrangements or agreements shall provide for the agency to have the right to aggregate the petroleum which the agency is entitled to lift pursuant to these arrangements with any petroleum to which it may otherwise become entitled and shall ensure recognition by the relevant third parties that petroleum in respect of which the agency serves an election notice hereunder shall be treated in the same manner as all petroleum from, or attributable to, the COF governed by such arrangements or agreements.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0181">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
<p><i>Access to Information</i></p>
<p>5.—(1) The Agency shall have full access to all information relating to the COF in the same manner as each of the other parties, or, if relevant, sole risk parties, to the relevant operating agreement, amending operating agreement, offtake, lifting, terminal or pipeline arrangements and/or agreement applicable to that COF.</p>
<p>(2) The Agency shall have the right at all meetings, whether of Operating Committees, other sub committees or otherwise, established under or pursuant to the relevant operating agreement, amended operating agreement and offtake, lifting, terminal and pipeline arrangements and/or agreements applicable to that COF.</p>
<p>(3) Without prejudice to the generality of the above such information shall include all such production profiles, such data relating to actual and estimated production, estimated reserves, quantities, qualities, anticipated delays or interruptions in production, storage, and transport systems, timing and dates of lifting and delivery and of tanker movements, and such agency papers and other documents applicable to meetings of the relevant operating committee, and any sub committees thereof.'.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to commend the four amendments to the Committee. It is about time that the Minister showed a spark of generosity. Not one of our amendments has received any sympathy, even though they have been helpful and logical. Slime of the amendments claimed attention only, perhaps, on account of their literary merit; no doubt the Minister is not interested in that, and dispensed with them immediately. Other amendments emphasised the real difference between our two parties, and I can understand why the Minister disposed of them, too.<br><br>
I would like the Minister to recall the sympathetic view that he took of BNOC, and therefore of the agency, on Second Reading. I remind him that on 14 May he said that
<br><blockquote><p>"this is not a case … of trying to cut down some lame duck corporation that has been losing money through inefficiency … That is most certainly not the Government's view … Although we are discarding the major function and purpose of BNOC, it has other functions and purposes." —<i>[Official Report, 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c. 190.]</i></p></blockquote>
The Minister went on to refer to the importance of security of supply.<br><br>
If the agency, in taking over those residual functions, is to be able to meet the need that it might one day confront to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of the security of this nation's energy supplies, it should have an opportunity to gain relevant experience; that is the idea informing the group of amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 40 was tabled with an element of irritation and bitterness at the way in which the Secretary of State has apparently ignored the relatively reassuring words that I have just quoted when issuing instructions to his Department. The amendment is reasonable and appropriate, in that it gives the agency a reserve capacity with which to serve the national interest at a time of crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be able to clarify something for me quickly. I notice that amendment No. 40 relates to<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"participation agreements to cover all oil discovered and produced in the United Kingdom North Sea."</p></blockquote>
whereas amendment No. 43 refers to "the United Kingdom Continental Shelf". Is it the hon. Gentleman's intention not to cover oil found west of Shetland in the amendment?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may have used a different form of words, but our approach is a comprehensive one. The hon. Gentleman may be assured that, considerations of viscosity permitting, the oil will be taken and our consistency of approach will be demonstrated. The reason for the wording of the amendment is, I believe, that we do not expect to be taking out oil from west of Shetland during the lifetime of the present Government. This Government will continue to be inflicted on us at least until the early summer of 1988, but I doubt whether oil from that locality will be flowing by then.<br><br>
I am particularly fond of amendment No. 43, which I regard as the gamekeeper amendment. The Minister does not seem to be keen on the agency being involved in committees. My hon. Friends and I take the firm view that the agency should have involvement in committees, should be securing information and should be making its presence clear within the industry and making it known that it will have an important role to play. The Government accept that it may one day have an important role to play, and it should therefore have a capacity to secure information and develop relationships—even personal relationships, which obviously are relevant to committee activities—and so our amendment is important.<br><br>
I describe this as the gamekeeper amendment because to some extent that should be the agency's role just as, to some extent, it was the role of the BNOC. However, one cannot serve as gamekeeper unless one knows the ground, and I fear that if the Minister insists on the agency operating away from sources of information and decision-making it will not know the ground and will be far less effective and less able to operate in a crisis, so amendment No. 43 is a sensible one. If the Minister wants to accept just one of our minor amendments as a goodwill gesture, that would be the amendment to accept, but I doubt whether he will do so. I commend it to him nevertheless.<br><br>
Amendment No. 52 is an addition to clause 2(1) inserting words relating to the model participation agreement which is involved with amendment No. 53. Amendment No. 53 is very long but its length is important and relevant, and while the Minister may not have taken the trouble to read it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the Minister's assurance that he has read amendment No. 53. He will understand what a difficult task he faces later in the debate in arguing against it when it is full of virtue. I admit that I was unfamiliar with the term COF until it appeared in the text of new schedule, but one reason for the amendment's importance, as the Minister is aware, is that, as the industry frequently proclaims, a number, perhaps a substantial number, of other oilfields will be located and developed off foreign coasts in the next 20 or 30 years which the right hon. Gentleman must and does expect to be much smaller, perhaps even smaller than Argyll.<br><br>
Perhaps Argyll will come to be seen as a substantial field compared to some of our interests in Shetland, which will be considered later, but we are now considering small oilfields which today may not be perceived as commercial despite the concessions that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0182">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
the Government has already given them. Amendment No. 53 has a sharp relevance to maintaining national interest and involvement in those fields.<br><br>
The Government have already accepted that royalties, tax take and fiscal benefit from small commercial oilfields will be very small. Perhaps they have been too generous towards some of the fields, but we recognised during the passage of the Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Bill that the Government would have to make particularly generous concessions to allow the really small fields—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely my hon. Friend cannot be surprised. He is talking in terms of the future and this Government, since 1979, have been consistent in their lack of long-term planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The present situation is lamentable. In view of our own interest in energy, he and I know that the Government do not look ahead. We have called on them to look ahead to consider the implications for future decades. I sometimes think that they do not look beyond the middle of next week, and that is true of some sections of the Department of Energy. My hon. Friend is quite right to draw attention to the crying need for the Department to look beyond its nose.<br><br>
The amendment is trying to look to the future. It seeks to have a structure in lifting arrangements and the exercise of the agency's involvement in natural gas, liquids, and so on, that will ensure that the state has a proper relationship, not least with the very small fields that will become more numerous and, perhaps, the norm after the mid-1990s.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept that the House should seek to legislate far in advance. Law should not be made purely out of concern about what might happen in the next few months, so we should look a little further ahead. My hon. Friend has done the House and the Committee a service in presenting a form of words in the amendment and the related amendment No. 52 which could take us a long way towards establishing proper arrangements and structures, especially for the smaller oilfields.<br><br>
Therefore, if the Minister wishes to be constant and consistent, he will recognise the one way in which he can marry his words that were reported in col. 190 of the <i>Official Report</i> of the Second Reading debate with the needs of the day and those which will develop. He will find that amendments Nos. 40, 43, 52 and 53 are particularly relevant.<br><br>
In particular, I draw the Minister's attention to the need to consider amendments Nos. 52 and 53 together. We believe that they have considerable merit, even though amendment No. 53 is unusually long. I hope that the Minister will not rely on the natural idleness of his hon. Friends. He assured me that he has read amendment No. 53, and when I saw the grins on the faces of his hon. Friends who, it is plain, have not read it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that they have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is too charitable. They
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
have not read the amendment, and that was obvious from the way in which they pulled faces when I made reference to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not be charitable from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not be charitable from an upstanding position when he is dealing with the Government—of that there is no doubt.<br><br>
I merely say that the Minister would be acting in an arrogant manner, which would be untypical of him, if he were to rely on defeating my hon. Friend's amendments simply because of the idleness of his hon. Friends. That would be deplorable, especially as the amendments—as they would find if they would only take the trouble to read them—are utterly convincing. Conservative Members should take the point made by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) when I charitably gave way to him so that he could make proper reference to the oilfields west of Shetlands.<br><br>
I hope that we carry the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetlands with us because he will have read the amendments. The people of Orkney and Shetlands are always assiduous in performing their duties, so the hon. Gentleman will have perceived the merit of the amendments. If Conservative Members would only read them, I believe that they would encourage the Minister of State to accept them. Certainly, I trust that they will be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) for his outline of this group of amendments, and I shall take the opportunity to flesh out in more detail the argument that he made. However, before doing so, as I was out of order by being charitable from a sedentary position I shall now be charitable—despite the stricture of my hon. Friend—from a standing position.<br><br>
I am sure that Conservative Members have read amendment No. 52 and the subsequent amendment relating to the model provision for participation agreements, because they have done nothing else this afternoon. Therefore, they have had plenty of time in which to read the amendments and I am sure that they have done so and will have noted their merits. If not, I shall certainly be able to underline one or two of the merits of the provisions. I am looking forward to the debate because the Minister promised to educate us in these matters, and I anticipate that tutorial with eagerness.<br><br>
7.15 p.m.<br><br>
Let me explain the aim behind the amendments in more detail. The Minister said on Second Reading—I shall not repeat his remarks ad nauseam—that there were twin pillars to the concept of security of supply: first, the agency will have a royalty-in-kind oil role, and secondly, it will be the keeper and promoter of participation agreements. He said that the participation agreements would not be activated, but would lie dormant as the second factor ensuring security of supply. The aim and purpose of participation agreements has certainly been to do that in the past,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0183">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
although a right that is not exercised is of far less worth than one that is.<br><br>
However we have been told that one basis of our security of oil supply will be the dormant participation agreements. We have therefore tabled amendments Nos. 52 and 53 to ensure that we have good participation agreements, which can be activated when necessary. Amendment No. 40 is linked, and so is amendment No. 43, because it was drafted before I devised the concept of a model participation agreement.<br><br>
We ought to know what we are talking about and why we need a model participation agreement. The Minister will know that the whole system has grown up higgledy piggledy. Participation agreements and rights grew up in a series of ad hoc arrangements that started back in 1974-75. The aim and purpose of all such agreements is to establish the principle that BNOC, the new agency or whatever has the right to control the destination, and to own and purchase 51 per cent. of the crude oil deriving from the UK continental shelf—a phrase on which the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) properly chided us. That is the first basic principle of all participation arrangements but the arrangements have been put in place in a variety of ways, and therefore need clarification.<br><br>
The whole concept of participation agreements and rights was first set out in July 1974 in a White Paper which was followed up by the proposals for the exploration of North sea oil and gas set out in command paper 6408 in February 1976.<br><br>
The principle aim of participation as set out in the White Paper was to build up through the BNOC experience of the continental shelf and its operations, to improve the Government's knowledge of the North sea and of the continental shelf operations, to secure control over the disposal of at least a proportion of the petroleum produced and to secure through BNOC a direct voice in decisions about the exploitation of the commercial fields. That is the origin of participation agreements.<br><br>
After the enactment of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975, the Department of Energy negotiated with no fewer than 64 oil companies which held interests from the first to the fourth rounds a series of agreements entitling the BNOC to 51 per cent. of all oil produced under those licences and in the North sea. That was the first set of participation agreements to be put into place. It was done not by legislation but by direct negotiation, company by company and licence by licence.<br><br>
Of course, we got better at it in the fifth and sixth rounds under successive Labour Secretaries of State for Energy. In the fifth round, we established the 51 per cent. right of participation through an equity holding in all the licences. In the sixth round, that 51 per cent. was a minimum; in some instances the figure was higher. The exception was when BNOC joined with BGC and their combined rights added up to 51 per cent.<br><br>
There there was the change of Government in 1979. In July of that year, although BNOC representatives were no longer allowed to sit on certain committees in relation to the North sea in which the corporation had no operating interest, the 51 per cent. principle was upheld. In the seventh round a condition was attached to all the licences, giving the Government, through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
BNOC, a right to purchase 51 per cent. of the oil. Matters were somewhat confused by the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, when all BNOC's equity interests were floated off into Britoil. That required a major new participation agreement to replace the 51 per cent. equity holdings by BNOC which underpinned the arrangements in the fifth and sixth rounds of licensing. However, the new agreement established BNOC's right to 51 per cent. of Britoil's oil.<br><br>
It was recognised that some aspects of the draft model agreement had a strong resemblance to the arrangement that was subsequently agreed between Britoil and the Secretary of State to establish that right in the fifth and sixth rounds, although ownership had been transferred to Britoil. But in other respects there was not the classic type of participation agreement that we are trying to set up in amendments Nos. 52 and 53; other arrangements were made. In certain instances, the 51 per cent. was established only by means of a petroleum option deed.<br><br>
I confess to a certain ignorance in this respect. What form does such a deed take? When the agency has had transferred to it under clauses 2 and 3 all the agreements and arrangements, presumably those petroleum option deeds, at present with BNOC, will be included. How much is covered not by the original 64 negotiated agreements or the Britoil participation agreement on the fifth and sixth rounds but by the option deed arrangements that underpin the right to 51 per cent. of the oil?<br><br>
I have tried to show that the system supported by the Government—although some of their Back Benchers do not do so of the 51 per cent. arrangement in participation agreements has grown up in a series of different and sometimes confusing ways, perhaps based on a change in Government policy. Nevertheless, common to most of them is the right of BNOC representatives to serve on all the relevant operating committees dealing with operational matters, and with such factors as lifting and when the oil will become available, and with shipping and terminals, and so on.<br><br>
There is a barrage of committees relating to the North sea covering a series of detailed arrangements for lifting, trans-shipping, production, and the timing of delivery and distribution of North sea oil.<br><br>
BNOC has, quite rightly, been represented on most of the committees because that is relevant to their needs as traders. It must know when the oil will become available and at which terminal it will arrive. It must know what quality and quantity will arrive at a given time, and what arrangements are being made by other parties to the operation to lift and ship out the oil.<br><br>
BNOC has served on a number of these key operation committees because of its trading of royalty oil and participation oil. We must accept that if the Government have their way, the agency will not have mass participation oil to trade, but it will still be managing and trading in royalty oil, so it will need the right to serve on key committees that are relevant to the management and trading of royalty oil.<br><br>
Amendment No. 43 sought to establish the agency's rights to serve on key committees so that it would not be disadvantaged, left in ignorance, caught unawares or hoodwinked by other operators in its task of managing and trading royalty oil in the North sea.<br><br>
The committees are not formal bodies which do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0184">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
nothing. They deal with such issues as quarterly production figures, what is likely to be taken from each field in the following six months—a vital matter to anyone trying to trade in royalty oil, as we know from our debate on previous amendments. The agency will have to know quarterly production figures and how the oil is to be lifted, and have the right to be present if it considers that it is its duty to be present on these key committees relating to the North sea. That is the purpose of amendment No. 43.<br><br>
The principle was accepted when the oil production side of BNOC was severed under the 1982 Act. I recall an interesting debate that is summarised in col. 393 of the <i>Official Report</i> of the Committee stage of the <i>Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Bill 1982</i> which showed that Ministers accepted that BNOC, as a trading organisation, would have to serve on a number of these key committees. That was accepted and put into practice by BNOC after 1982.<br><br>
Will the Minister say how he sees the agency performing its role on some of these committees to ensure that it performs its duties and responsibilities as the manager and trader of royalty oil in kind, and what rights it will have when it serves on those committees?<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 40, 52 and 53 deal with the other aspect—the type of participation agreement that the clause will empower the agency to enter into, and what type of participation agreement it will allow and ask companies to sign.<br><br>
Amendment No. 40 seeks to ensure that all North sea oil is covered. I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government do not intend to dilute the basic principle that 51 per cent. of all future oil from the North sea will be covered by participation agreements.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland rightly pointed out a defect in the wording of the amendment. We referred to United Kingdom North Sea oilfields. I hope that he will accept that we intended to refer to the United Kingdom continental shelf.<br><br>
Amendment No. 40 is defective in another way—it should also cover onshore agreements. There is no reason why participation agreements of this type should not cover onshore oil. Will the Minister confirm, either by accepting the amendment or the spirit of the amendment, that the principle of participation agreements will cover all future oil production in the North sea? It has done so up to now.<br><br>
All existing rights held by BNOC in this respect are being transferred to the agency, partly under this clause and partly under clause 3. We seek an assurance that participation agreements and rights will be established on all future North sea oil production. That is the purpose of amendment No. 40.<br><br>
7.30 p.m.<br><br>
In Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 we have tried to devise a model participation agreement—a common format to be used by the new agency. That has two advantages. First, as I explained, the system of participation agreements has grown up higgledy piggledy and it would therefore be a good idea to have a model participation agreement similar to our models for royalty oil and for oil licences. A model
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
participation agreement would be perfectly consistent with the rest of our North sea oil legislation.<br><br>
Secondly, such a model would make an agreement easier for the agency to administer, activate and reactivate in time of shortage if the Secretary of State triggered the agency's participation rights.<br><br>
I also want to alter past practice in certain key respects. The Minister will notice that in amendment No. 52 we establish the considerations that should be contained in a model participation agreement. I shall deal with some of them when I explain what we are doing in amendment No. 53. But there are others that I have not included—for example, the protection of the agency's rights, and assignment. Both are vital because North sea ownership and licences are not static; they are changing constantly. They are being farmed in and sold and there are mergers.<br><br>
The ownership of licences changes from month to month. That will become more relevant in the light of the merger mania that is likely to develop. It is vital that we establish the agency's rights and that in any assignment of licences, participation rights will be unaltered and will be binding on the new licence holder. An important aspect of participation agreements in the past has been that when an interest in a licence has been assigned to a new owner, the basic rights of the corporation have in no way been changed or diluted.<br><br>
In referring to the protection of the agency's rights, I have in mind the fact that companies or people who hold interests in licences can go bust and can try to use their share in the licence to raise a mortgage or a loan for other activities. It is vital that any participation agreement is watertight and that any mortgage or other financial encumbrance in no way dilutes or affects the agency's right to its 51 per cent. participation oil. That is fundamental to a decent model participation agreement.<br><br>
This may sound fanciful, but an oil company could go into receivership. I hope that a model participation agreement would act as a safeguard and that, irrespective of what happened to an oil company's assets, the receiver could never dilute, destroy or undermine the agency's participation rights.<br><br>
I have touched upon the important aspects of amendment No. 52, but it is in amendment No. 53 that we endeavour to establish some basic model provisions for the new participating agreements. It will not have escaped the Minister's notice that the first important change contained in the model participation agreement is in paragraph 2 of the draft schedule, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An election notice, given by the Agency in respect of crude oil shall be served on seller and on the operator not less than 30 days before the commencement of the election period to which the election notice relates."</p></blockquote>
That gives the agency and the Government the right to serve election notices to trigger participation agreements faster than can be done at present. One nonsensical aspect of the Government's argument that dormant participation agreements will be of value in times of crisis is that none of the rights can be exercised for six months. A crisis such as the Gulf war would have to wait for a minimum of six months while the Secretary of State told the agency to serve notices to activate the participation agreements. It will take a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
minimum of six months to activate half of the participation agreements. The other half will take 12 months to activate. I hope that the Minister will accept the principle of paragraph 2 of the proposed schedule. For the moment, I am accepting that he will get his way and that we shall have to depend on dormant participation agreements for the security of our oil supplies. I hope that he will accept, therefore, that he needs to be able to activate the rights faster than most existing participation agreements allow. Paragraph 2 therefore reduces the minimum period from six months to 30 days.<br><br>
The second change in the addition of methane to the LPG rights in paragraph 3. Most participation agreements covering LPG include special arrangements because British Gas was the sole purchaser. But what happens if British Gas is privatised? Should the privatised company have the right to special control over methane from the North sea? The present arrangements were made between two state corporations. BNOC and British Gas reached an agreement about natural gas from the North sea. But if British Gas is privatised, should we continue to allow it special privileges in this regard? Should not the agency have the right to serve a notice on everyone, including the privatised British Gas?<br><br>
Consistent with our 30-day notice on crude oil, we also propose to reduce the period for serving notices in relation to LPG from the traditional 12 months to six months. As the Government are to depend more heavily on activating participation agreements, I hope that the Minister will accept the principle of those changes.<br><br>
Paragraph 4 underlines just how complex and serious participation agreements are. The detailed arrangements that have to be in place for a meaningful and effective activation in time of crisis will require the rights and lifting arrangements provided in paragraph 4.<br><br>
They will certainly require the access to information laid down in paragraph 5. Such access will be essential to a speedy activation and to trading in participation oil if the Secretary of State asks the agency to activate the agreements. I hope that the Minister will not oppose paragraph 5 of the new schedule, which is sensible and reasonable. Indeed, it is vital to the effective implementation of the participation agreement.<br><br>
Subsections (2) and (3) of paragraph 5 would confirm the present right of agency representatives to attend all operating committees involving
<br><blockquote><p>"offtake, lifting, terminal and pipeline arrangements and/or agreements applicable"</p></blockquote>
to a commercial oilfield. I have explained the purpose of that model provision. It is basic to the effective activating of the participation agreements that agency staff who serve on those committees know the arrangements. The agency can thus move speedily in exercising its right to take control over oil supplies.<br><br>
I hope that I have explained our detailed amendment which, strangely, is supportive of the Government's position. We are saying that if the Government believe that the security of oil supplies is dependent on participation agreements, but they do not want to activate them or exercise their right on a month-to-month or year-to-year basis, let us at least
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
ensure that the pieces of paper lying in the cupboard—no doubt the dust will have to be blown from them when a crisis arises and the Secretary of State wants the agency to exercise the participation rights—are good, solid and well-developed agreements of the sort that we propose. Although I am beginning to wonder whether I will be able to woo the Minister of State and achieve my objective in terms of the amendments, I do not see how he can oppose them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments, although with no great enthusiasm. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has explained the history of the participation agreements. It occurs to me that there are two aspects of the matter. First—this factor was developed well before BNOC started up in the mid-1970s—there was the Government involvement in oil companies' plans and activities. In other words, the Government knew what was happening. No one could complain about that, as they were representing the national interest in a vital national resource. That is reflected in the model participation agreement set out in amendments Nos. 53 and 43 relating to attendance at committee meetings.<br><br>
The other factor is access to oil. The Minister said that there was security of supply through the activating of the participation agreements, but I believe that they are a second-best option. If the national interest was to be best served by involvement in North sea oil activities, that should have been taken care of during the fifth and sixth licensing rounds by means of the equity stake; that is still the best way to proceed. However, regrettably that battle was fought and lost when Britoil was created and the hiving-off from BNOC took place.<br><br>
As for the problem of trying to get oil in a time of crisis, I would like to hear the Minister's views on the complicated system of keeping participation agreements on ice, ready to be activated if and when the occasion arises.<br><br>
7.45 p.m.<br><br>
What is wrong with going about the problem in a simpler way? Why do we need this panoply of complicated agreements which are difficult to understand, even in the model clauses? I have read them, but could not claim to understand every line of them. What is so magical about the 12.5 per cent. royalty figure? Could not legislation increase the royalty figure, with the Government saying that they would not exercise their option to take more at present? The option would still be there in the event of some emergency,and would provide a simple means of obtaining more oil.<br><br>
Alternatively, the Government could bring forward simple legislation that would give them access to oil without the need for long and complicated agreements. They could then compensate the oil companies for the oil taken through tax concessions, for example, that could be worked out subsequently.<br><br>
It will not be possible to do that within the terms of this Bill. However, my suggestion would appear to offer a simpler way to achieve the purpose behind participation agreements—the security of oil supplies.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0186">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
If, as proposed by the Government, the agency continues to enter into participation agreements, the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) and for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) are to be commended. I accept that the amendments are intended to cover the whole of the United Kingdom continental shelf.<br><br>
I can understand that some benefit may be derived from participation at meetings. No doubt officials of the Department of Energy could acquire the information in other ways. I anticipate that the Minister may object to the amendment on the ground of confidentiality,but if that is a problem, it must have existed throughout the life of BNOC. I do not believe that there has ever been any weakness in the confidentiality of BNOC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the problem of confidentiality was solved amicably and successfully by BNOC. It honoured the confidentiality of all the information that it obtained. Indeed, some participation agreements contain legally binding contractual obligations to ensure confidentiality. I have not included it in my model clause, but it would be quite proper to have a paragraph on confidentiality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, which ties in with the point that I was making. Confidentiality has not been a problem, and would not serve as an argument against attendance at committee meetings.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 52, and the types of heading for which provision should be made, if we are to have participation agreements it is important that they be drawn up thoroughly. The detailed model clauses do not spell out how the price would be fixed in forthcoming agreements, and there has been some criticism of the present way of fixing the price. I hope that a more simple way of doing that can be found.<br><br>
One of the most significant provisions of the new model clauses is that highlighted by the hon. Gentleman. It provides that the option to take oil be exercised not less than 30 days before commencement, which is in stark contrast to the present position in which periods of six and twelve months apply. The Government have told the House and the Committee that they are concerned about security of supply, which is why participation agreements will continue to be used.<br><br>
Periods of six and twelve months give security of supply if one is able to foresee periods of crisis on the horizon, but often crises spring up unexpectedly. Who knows what will result from the present hijacking incident? Such an incident could easily snowball into a crisis of global importance, and the Government might wish to use participation agreements to ensure supplies. A shorter period, therefore, would enhance short-term security of supply and thus improve the present position.<br><br>
What I have described is very much a second best option, but if we are to have participation agreements for the reasons given by the Government, the amendments are worthy of support.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) that the Government intend to maintain the framework for participation in future by securing in new developments such participation rights as they have had in the past. As part of the arrangements by which new licences are issued, petroleum option deeds will be executed and suitable arrangements will be negotiated with the licensees of first to fourth round licences when new developments come forward.<br><br>
However, amendment No. 40 would be a clear break with the past. The Secretary of State has been a party to every main participation agreement to date and the Government have defined the policy of participation. Certainly, that was the approach adopted by the Labour Government and I believe that Government control over those matters should be reflected by an explicit discretion over the agency entering into new participation agreements so that it would be in a comparable position to that of BNOC. For that reason, I ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 40.<br><br>
For fields discovered under the seventh and later licensing rounds, model participation agreements already exist and they are incorporated in a schedule to the petroleum option deeds. The model provisions set out in the amendment would conflict with the provisions of those deeds and some of those suggested by the amendment are unreasonable or cumbersome. It would not be right to tamper with arrangements already put in place after consultation with the industry and BNOC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In regard to fresh oilfields, will the oil companies which carry out the drilling to search for oil notify the Department of any minerals that may be found in the course of drilling?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those who have the licence are obliged to provide information to the Department and I understand that information that was wider than that relating to petroleum would be provided to it.<br><br>
Agreements may have to be negotiated from scratch in respect of the first to fourth round licences, and I suspect that Opposition Members may have forgotten the experience of their colleagues who had responsibility for these matters when they were in Government. After consideration they concluded that participation should be achieved by voluntary negotiation with licensees on a basis that would leave licensees neither better nor worse off. That principle has remained—correctly, in my view—central to the approach of Governments of both persuasions.<br><br>
Some of the specific provisions are unreasonable, especially that to which the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) referred. For example, the proposed minimum notice periods are unreasonably short.<br><br>
I do not argue in relation to security of supply and participation that they are absolutely necessary in the short term and I never did. I said that we had had the arrangements for the shorter term and I believe that under participation agreement arrangements, we have security for the longer term. I repeat that the amendments would make them unreasonably short. For oil and NGLs, it is 30 days and six months
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0187">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
respectively which compare with six months and 12 months in the petroleum option deeds. Of course, I appreciate that shorter notice periods give greater flexibility, but account must be taken of the operation and marketing needs of the licensees.<br><br>
The proposal of only 30 days' notice is unreasonable, because, even in the present market with virtually all North sea oil being sold on a spot basis, most oil is actually sold between four and eight weeks ahead. If licensees had to have oil available for BNOC at 30 days' notice, they would in effect be distress sellers and would obtain poorer prices. I do not believe that that would be in anyone's interests.<br><br>
I recognise that amendment No. 43 has been moved to probe the Governments intentions on the attendance of the agency at operating committees. I do not believe that it is necessary, because the Bill's provision fully cover the powers which are specifically mentioned in the amendment. The Committee will see that clause 2(1)<i>(c)</i> is perfectly clear and comprehensive. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency shall have power…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p><i>(c)</i> to do anything required for the purpose of giving effect to agreements entered under paragraph <i>(a)</i> or <i>(b)</i> above and to such participation agreements entered into by persons other than the Agency as the Secretary of State may determine".</p></blockquote>
That will include all attendance at committees and the like in so far as it is required to give effect to any participation agreement.<br><br>
I am aware that when BNOC was originally established, it had the statutory duty to advise the Secretary of State on matters connected with petroleum. That gave the corporation a dual role on operating committees—on the one hand, protecting its participation and equity interests and, on the other, channelling information to the Secretary of State. In fact, the latter role was effectively suspended by the Conservative Government when they came to power in 1979. With the separation of Britoil, BNOC was directed to limit its attendance at committees to such occasions when matters relating to its interests in petroleum produced might be under discussion and to limit the exercise of its rights to information relevant to those interests. To make our intentions quite clear, we intend to issue a similar direction to the agency with effect from its formation, taking into account the fact that it will not in normal times be lifting participation oil.<br><br>
Amendment No. 43 could have an unfortunate effect by giving rise to needless doubts that the old dual role was to be resuscitated. That is certainly not our intention. The agency will exercise its powers to attend and serve on committees in so far as it is required to protect its ability to get the best value for the sales of royalty-in-kind oil and, should options ever be exercised again, participation oil. I must therefore ask my hon. Friends to reject this group of amendments.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has overlooked one or two points. We are amending the first part of the clause; our model participation agreements would apply to all future participation agreements, not to existing ones being renegotiated. That is what I intended the amendments to mean. Do they not do that? The old existing arrangements are being carried across and I assumed that
<br><blockquote><p>"entered into by persons other than the Agency"</p></blockquote>
in clause 2(1)<i>(c)</i> meant the BNOC. We are trying to ensure that the agency will enter into such future participation agreements. Our model agreement will adopt that format, so the Minister's earlier observations were not relevant or fair. We are not suggesting that all the existing arrangements should be renegotiated to match the model, but at least we are looking to the future.<br><br>
Secondly, of course the earlier arrangements were voluntary in the first to fourth rounds because the licences were already in place. They had to be negotiated voluntarily, but that does not invalidate the experience that we are trying to create for the agency in adopting a new set of procedures.<br><br>
Finally, it is clear now that the participation agreements which were supposed to be one of the twin pillars on the security of oil supplies are now turning out to be nothing more than paper rights. The Minister now says that they will not be of much use, but that if the crisis can wait he has other provisions that can eventually trigger off his rights to participation oil, though he will have to wait six or 12 months for those arrangements.<br><br>
8.0 p.m.<br><br>
A headline in the <i>Financial Times</i> on the International Energy Agency's report this week that warned us of complacency. The most complacent person that I have ever come across in dealing with and handling this nation's oil supplies is the right hon. Gentleman, and that complacency has been reflected in his response to amendments Nos. 52 and 53 but I accept the modest assurance that he has given on amendment No. 40 that future oil will be covered by participation agreements and 51 per cent. rights.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
