	<p>[Sir PHILIP HOLLAND 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>New Towns and Urban Development Corporations Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr. Ian Gow)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings of the New Towns and Urban Development Corporations Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
May I express the satisfaction given to members of the Committee, Sir Philip, on learning that you are to be our Chairman, and say how much we look forward to serving under your chairmanship? Two Opposition Members and some of my hon. Friends had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship in the previous Session and we know what we are in for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have circulated to members of the Committee copies of notes on clauses. If any hon. Member has not received a copy there are more available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tyne Bridge) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great delight in welcoming you, Sir Philip, to the Committee. You may recall that in another Committee I said that I did not welcome you because I know that its proceedings would be exceptionally long and arduous and that it would sit through the night. I do not think that this Committee will be like that. That is why I welcome you to it. It is all right to welcome a Chairman—as we do, Sir Philip—but I do not want the Chairman to have to work long and hard hours unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not intend to oppose the sittings motion. We thank the Minister for the notes on clauses which he kindly provided—unlike some Ministers—at an early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are rather concerned about the speed with which the Bill went into Committee. I can put that down only to the fact that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) volunteered to serve on the Committee. On this occasion he was right, but I give him a friendly word of warning. In future he should be wary about volunteering for Committees, because at four o'clock in the morning he may wonder why he volunteered. So, having volunteered once, he should be careful in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some reservations about the Bill and that was made clear on Second Reading. We intend to probe the Minister in many ways—for clarification on some matters and because we feel deeply about others. I have a request for the Minister at the outset as it may save me the trouble of tabling a new clause. He will recall that on Second Reading I spoke of the job-seeking and job-making agencies of new towns. I can see nothing in the Bill to replace them. If the Minister can assure us
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that other agencies or bodies will fill those areas on which grave concern has been expressed by many hon. Members, that may save me and the Committee many problems in debating a new clause. I say that in the kindest way because I do not want to do unnecessary work if some undertaking will be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I should be out of order if I responded to the request of the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans). I give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking that well before we reach the stage when we may be considering new clauses, I shall write to him in response to his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Worcestershire) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee frequently, but I wish to respond to the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans). I am surprised that he is surprised that I have volunteered to serve on the Committee. Clearly, this is important legislation. I am honoured to have a new town in my constituency. That is the prime reason for my volunteering although, having seen the membership and chairmanship of the Committee, I feel sure that it will be well run and managed and will conduct its affairs in a civilised and reasonable manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Government Back-Bench Member can wish no more. I look forward to participating in the Committee's work in that spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope that due note will be taken of the fact that one volunteer is worth 10 pressed men. As I have volunteered so early in the Session, I hope that I shall not be called upon too frequently later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during consideration of the New Towns and Urban Development Corporations Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesday and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution, copies of which are available in the Committee room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I call attention to the need for adequate notice to be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript or starred amendments, but I draw the Committee's attention to a manuscript amendment on the Chairman's provisional selection of amendments. We shall take amendments Nos. 4 and 5 together under clause 2. I understand that that is acceptable to both Front Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Ordered,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 10, Schedule 1, Clause 11, Schedule 2, Clauses 12 to 14, Schedule 3, new Clauses, new Schedules, Clause 15, Schedule 4.—[	<i>Mr. Gow.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<div class='title'>Change of Functions of Commission</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 9, leave out " and ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 12, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>" and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) the agreement of the local authority in whose area the property or land is situated."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment arises from the debate on Second Reading. We are worried that, without agreement or consultation, new towns will be able to take decisions which affect their local authorities. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) will recall that on Second Reading I talked about company towns. My point was valid because new towns have sometimes sold off large portions of land which subsequently have been developed without due regard to the surrounding area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, in my area we have bitter memories of a town with, in effect, one employer. I refer, of course, to Jarrow. Anyone who reads " The Rape of Jarrow " will understand what I mean. One large shipbuilding concern provided almost all the employment for the town. I admit freely that there are good and bad employers, but that employer had a virtual veto over all that happened in the town. He threatened that if he did not get planning permission for his projects he would close the shipyard so that the town faded. Inevitably, he got his way, irrespective of whether it was good or bad for the town, because the consequences of opposing him were too frightening. The amendment seeks to avoid such situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asking only that local authorities are consulted and taken into account. We must not forget that the Bill deals with the winding up of new towns. Many of us are not happy about that, but we must live in the real world. One has only to count the number of Conservative Members in this room to realise that it is obvious that the Bill will be enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is concerned primarily with what will happen afterwards. It is no good winding up new towns and allowing the development of situations such as that which faced Jarrow. The problem could be solved by amending the clause in the way that we suggest so that local authorities were consulted at the time when they could do some good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister can say anything against our intentions. We are trying to be construestructive in this matter so that local authorities are fully consulted. We want all the issues to be taken into account when, ultimately, much against our will, property or land is sold. At least the local authority will have had an input, will have made its case, for or against, and will have drawn attention to any possible consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That goes to the heart of the matter. In the clause, the Government themselves say that the people, the area and their well-being should be considered. The amendment clarifies that. We are writing specifically into the Bill an aim which the Government leave rather vague, to put it kindly. We believe firmly that " local " means local. Local authorities are elected by local people, and it is right and proper that
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
they should be brought in at the early stages on matters that will affect their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans). As it stands, the Bill does nothing to alleviate the problems that will face communities when it is enacted. The Committee must take into account the communities which the Bill will affect. My hon. Friend referred to the speed with which the Bill had come before the Committee. Indeed, I was appointed to the Committee last Tuesday; on Friday I was told that I would not be on it and yesterday I was back on it again. There has been some speed in deciding my part in the arrangements. The Queen's Speech contained no reference to the Bill. That illustrates my hon. Friend's point about the haste in which the Bill has been brought into Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tries to ensure that some consideration is given to those who will be affected by the Bill. The forced sale of assets and land for factories, for example, is of great concern to many people. Any sales of community assets should be in the interests of the community. The community's interests should be paramount in all the deliberations and decisions made in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge referred to company towns and especially to the shipbuilding industry. I shall refer to the mining industry. Even today a substantial number of communities are dependent on a single industry. The real cause of the problem in the mining industry is the fear of losing job opportunities in its communities. We fear company towns. We are fearful of what might happen if no consideration was given to the possible results of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of my knowledge and experience of the history of mining communities, I support the amendment. It tries to ensure that those in the community—especially local authorities but pressure groups as well—will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I served on the Wakefield authority, arrangements were made for private capital to be invested in developments, but at the same time there was a community input. The local authority worked in partnership with some of the developers in the area. The Minister ought to consider incorporating that possibility in the Bill. The amendment seeks just that, and I appeal to the Minister to note the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment as being proposed in good faith and in the interests of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I remind the Committee especially the hon. Members for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) and Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), of the extent to which there has existed in the past, and I hope may in the future, a bipartisan policy on new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge said that the Government were determined—that indeed is the case—that the new town development corporations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
should be wound up as soon as possible with advantage to those living in the new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a Labour Government who first set Parliament on the path of winding up the new town development corporations. I remind the hon. Members that Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City were both wound up in 1966. I was not in the House then but the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) certainly was. Although Corby, Harlow and Stevenage development corporations were all wound up in 1980, the decisions to do so had been taken during the lifetime of a previous Labour Government. The hon. Member for Norwood was a distinguished member of that Government. The policies set out in the Bill are, in a real sense, a continuation of the policies followed by successive Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reasons that prompted the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge and his hon. Friend the Member for Normanton to table amendment No. 1. I hope that what I say about the present practice of the Commission for the New Towns and of the new town development corporation will reassure the hon. Gentlemen. Of course, on major issues the Commission will have to find out, and give full weight to, the views of the local authority. The district council will be the authority to which the commission will have to look for planning permission for the development of any of its land. On many other aspects, there will be—and certainly should be—a close inter-relation between the activities of the commission and those of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission already works closely with local authorities in towns where it has taken over the assets of the development corporation. At Corby, for example, the joint industrial development committee has played a significant role in attracting jobs to the town, as the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge said earlier. A programme has been agreed at Corby between the Commission and the district council, and funded jointly. This has ensured the two bodies working closely together for the good of the town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission intends also to establish local liaison committees in further towns where it takes over assets. The chairmen of these liaison committees will be members of the commission. The district councils will choose their own representatives. Representatives of the county council and the local business community can be invited to attend as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission has shown the importance that it attaches to these local liaison committees by initiating them while it is still planning its own arrangements. The first meeting of the local liaison committee at Skelmersdale will take place tomorrow week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill lays on the commission the duty to have regard to the welfare and convenience of those living, working and carrying on business in the towns where it has responsibilities. The basic step in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
carrying out that duty is to decide what will conduce to the welfare of those who live and work there. The views of their elected representatives should play a full part in that process of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that explanation I hope that the Opposition will feel that they need not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that we have started our deliberations in this way. It appears that the Minister has no objection to the amendments but that he will not write them into the Bill. If I am right about that, it fires me even more to want them written into the Bill. As I have said on several occasions, we legislate for the bad boys, not the good boys. If provisions are written into the Bill, we can quote them and use them. If the good boys are doing what is right anyway, that is fine. It is the bad boys I am after, and there may be many of them. We should not take a chance that they will do what is right. With provisions written into the Bill we have some redress if everyone does not act accordingly, but we have none without the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Miinster talked about consultation. I agree with him that on many occasions good and constructive consultation takes place, but in many cases it is more like " insultation " than consultation. The amendment speaks of " the agreement ". There is a vast difference between consultation where the person holding the consultation is the sole arbiter and decision maker and consultation that requires the agreement of the local authority. That is the change that we seek to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, after the consultations have taken place, the only people who make the decisions are an elected undemocratic board of a new town. It might be a good board and the members might all get on well together, but there is no redress if they do not. That is the subtle difference and that is why I shall ask my hon. Friends to press for a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped that the Minister would see the sense of the amendment. He obviously does, but he does not want the amendment written into the Bill. The only difference between us is that he agrees with it but does not want it incorporated in the Bill while we agree with it and want it written into the Bill. All I can do is ask my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not vote on amendment No. 1, which is just a drafting amendment—we are not seeking votes on every proposal. However, amendment No. 2 contains a fundamental principle, and we shall press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 3 in page 2, leave out lines 39 and 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I nearly asked for a recount when you read out the voting figures, Sir Philip, but I thought that that would be rather frivolous. However, I shall keep a watch on the figures in future because if they are close, I shall ask for a recount, although I hardly think that that is likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment raises a matter of principle. The Bill lays down the " shall nots ", one of which stated on page 2, line 36:
	<br><blockquote><p>" dispose of any property by way of gift."</p></blockquote>
No one in his right mind would go against that. There is no right to dispose of property by way of gift, and, properly, the Bill does not allow it. The Commission would, if allowed to give away gifts, be disposing of property that belonged not to the Commission but to the people. Rightly, the Bill says " thou shalt not ". It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"..or for a consideration which is less than the best reasonably obtainable."</p></blockquote>
We oppose the selling of public assets in any case; nevertheless, the Bill states that if they are to be sold, the best return must be obtained. But the Bill goes on to state, as if by some divine right, that the Secretary of State knows best. Having told the commission what it cannot do, the Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"except under the general or special authority of the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
I concede that the Minister was right, in drafting the Bill, to lay down a " shall not " to the commission, but how can he confer on the Secretary of State the right to change that " shall not "?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far too often we sit in Committees, slog through Bills and give away our rights to a Secretary of State as if he, or his Department, had a divine right to know right from wrong. Every Bill before the House in this Session takes away the power of the people and that of Members of Parliament and confers that power on a Secretary of State to be exercised at any time. If the Bill is not amended, no one can question whether he is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill could produce a farcical situation in that the Secretary of State could give away acres. The Bill provides exactly for that as it stands. Yet, the same reason is used to say that others should not do so. If members of the Committee do not accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the amendment, it is questionable whether they should be Members of Parliament. Perhaps we should simply have a computer and a Secretary of State. The Minister had better make a very good case in responding to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill had stated that the Secretary of State's power would be subject to a draft resolution of the House of Commons, the provision might have been acceptable. At least Members would then have the chance to debate it. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire has informed me that there is a new town in his constituency. I do not know how many Conservative Members are in the same boat. Only two Conservative Members are nodding. I wish to direct my remarks specifically to them as that is the only way in which I can get them into the Lobby with me, when we might stand a chance of winning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask those two Conservative Members to think very hard. The Secretary of State—any Secretary of State—without their say so, even without their knowledge, could give away, or sell land in their areas for less than the best value obtainable. I ask them to consider where they would stand with their constituents if that should happen. Believe me, it can happen with the Bill as drafted. If Conservative Members wish to adjourn for two or three minutes to study the provisions, they will find that what I have said is true. I am not making a party-political point. I am merely saying that Conservative Members should realise that they are giving away their power to represent their constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because I recognise the importance of his argument. Does he recognise that, any Secretary of State is also a Member of Parliament, and as such has direct accountability? If a Secretary of State is of my own party, that fact can have influence on him and I can approach him on that basis. However, more interestingly, if the Secretary of State were of another party—I hypothesise that he would be a member of the next Labour Government —a Labour-controlled local authority in my new town, for example, could approach that Secretary of State on that basis. Therefore, I am quite satisfied with the clause as drafted—as I hope that the hon. Gentleman might be—as I believe that there is sufficient safeguard. I shall therefore be unable to vote with the hon. Gentleman on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I remind hon. Members that interventions should be short. In Committee, there is always an opportunity to catch the eye of the Chairman. An hon. Member can make a speech subsequent to that being made by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, but he has based his argument on a false assumption. He assumed that he would know exaclty what was going on. Nothing in the Bill says that the Secretary of State must tell the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire what is going to happen. Nothing in the Bill assumes that anyone is aware at the time what is happening.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
On Second Reading, I heard numerous speeches from Conservative Members who complained how difficult it was to obtain information from new towns. They were making pleas to the Minister. In fact, one hon. Member asked that there be another commission with greater authority to which hon. Members could complain if they could not obtain information from the commission. Hon. Members who took part in the Second Reading debate will recall that. I have no evidence that there have been such difficulties. I merely take the word of Conservative Members that they have experienced this type of difficulty. They seemed firm about it. If that is so, the clause becomes even more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire said that there should be redress to the Secretary of State. That can only be made if one knows what one is talking about. There is nothing in the clause which states, that the Secretary of State must inform Members of Parliament before he exercises his special authority. If that provision had been in the clause, it might have been slightly better. Therefore I appeal again to Conservative Members to think deeply. Any Bill which takes away the rights of Members of Parliament is suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all is right and proper, neither the Secretary of State nor anyone else should be afraid of the debate. Under clause 1, the Secretary of State need not debate with anyone. If he has nothing to fear, why not give this issue the light of day and give hon. Members who were elected to the House of Commons an opportunity at least to question it and air doubts. The amendment seeks that. If the clause is not amended, I shall return to the theme time and again, and not only in Committee. I repeat that I am not making a political point. I cannot understand how Members of Parliament can come to the House of Commons day in and day out to give away their powers to one person. They were not elected to do that and they should not do it. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie W. Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) has made a devastating case against the power of the Executive to decide virtually what it likes. The ominous word " except " in line 39 means in effect that the rest of the subsection is meaningless. The clause provides that the Secretary of State can decide whether the Commission can
	<ol>
	<li>acquire land or any interest or rights in or over land,</li>
	<li>make contributions towards the cost of providing amenities, supplies or services,</li>
	<li>make loans …,</li>
	<li>develop land …,</li>
	<li>dispose of any property …,".</li>
</ol>
The Minister can decide, without Parliament saying yea or nay, whether all those actions shall be carried out. If he is intent upon maintaining and increasing parliamentary accountability, he should accept the amendment and get rid of the carte blanche that is enshrined in the objectionable phrase which my
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge seeks to delete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember—it will be within the recollection of most hon. Members—the time when a Minister who is still prominent in the Government sold Hamilton college in Scotland to property speculators at a knockdown price which was far less than the market could sustain. The all-party and powerful Public Accounts Committee made scathing criticism of the Minister and the Opposition called for his resignation. It was a matter of great concern. Millions of pounds of public money were involved. In this case also, millions of pounds could be involved. We are talking not of peanuts but of land in areas where there has been vast public investment in schools, houses, roads and all types of public amenities. In other words, they have been a direct consequence of massive public investment; that is what the new towns are all about. But we are reaching the stage when private speculators wish to get their sticky hands on them, and they see the prospect of great profits arising from that public investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I mentioned Barratts the builders, which has its eyes on building land in the new towns. The company is building rabbit hutches in Glenrothes, and no doubt in other new towns. Indeed, I had a letter only yesterday from a woman in Glasgow about the scandal of that company building slums of the future. As Barratts makes large contributions to Tory party funds, it knows that it has sympathetic voices in the Government. No doubt Barratts will tell the Secretary of State that it would like land in Glenrothes or elsewhere, and under the clause there is nothing to prevent him from selling it to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(e) tells us that the commission shall not by virtue of section 36 of the Act
	<br><blockquote><p>" dispose of any property … for a consideration which is less than the best reasonably obtainable ".</p></blockquote>
Does it mean that such land may be flogged off to Barratts or some other company—perhaps even to Sainsbury?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans), he spoke about the pressure which can be brought to bear on Governments, and he is right. Indeed, Sainsbury could bring such pressure; it has a powerful influence on the Government. That company could say, for example, " We want that very desirable site in Harlow "—or Glenrothes—" so please let us have it at a knockdown price. After all, you have the power to do it in the legislation—
	<br><blockquote><p>'except under the general or special authority of the Secretary of State.' "</p></blockquote>
In other words, if he wants to flog off that land to Sainsbury, there is nothing to stop him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) and the entire Committee would acknowledge that the influence that may hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am merely pointing out that the power exists for the Secretary of State to abuse public assets by flogging them off, perhaps even to Tory Members who have all sorts of vested interests. Pressure is brought to bear; we have seen that happening in the past few years in respect of the privatising and commercialising of services in the NHS, for example. The new towns are wide open to such abuse. Indeed, the clause virtually lays it down that the Minister is given a blank cheque to dispose of the new town assets as he wishes. It is not good enough for the clause to be so loosely worded—deliberately so, I believe—as to enable the Secretary of State to do what he likes with these assets. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge will press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up the issues that have been raised. Clearly, the power sought by the Secretary of State in the clause gives rise to concern. I am sure that if Conservative Members had to speak with their hands on their hearts, they, too, would be worried by the power that will be assumed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to ensure that the philosophy of the Government and that word " democracy ", which is used constantly by the Prime Minister and her Ministers, will apply. Parliament must have some say in the administration and disposal of assets in the new towns if such matters are not to be left to the communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill omits to make reference to open competition if there is to be disposal of assets. Open competition is practised in local government when there is some disposal of assets similar to that being suggested in the Bill, such as disposal of land, buildings and other assets within the community. A date is usually set down when tenders or quotations must be submitted in sealed envelopes to be opened by two people and then registered. That sort of approach to disposal of assets in local government applies, so why will it not apply in this case? Why should such matters be left to the specific authority of the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Secretary of State will not examine each application. The applications will be dealt with by someone in his Department so the problem becomes greater. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) talked about powers being vested in people other than the Secretary of State. Those in his Department will have control so there is grave doubt about clause 1(4). The amendment seeks to ensure that the democracy of Parliament will prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is seeking new powers to acquire land and properties. The commission will develop into just a clearing house for the Government. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
hallmark of the Government—market forces being in play and competition within communities to share in the assets as in British Telecom—will not apply in the new towns. It is the large combines and undertakings that will be involved in the new towns and not the communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to the possibility of organisations such as Barratts being involved. I have experience of Barratts. I have constituents who are pressing legal cases against such firms and I hope that the problems on record, which show that the best interests of communities have not been served, will be taken into consideration. There will be a safeguard if the Minister accepts the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The references in the clause to the development and acquisition of land and the advancement of guarantees and loans are those which are usually made to local government. I hope that some of the assets will be made available to local government for it to develop in the interests of communities and not those of the larger developers, who can make overtures to the Government to get advantages and concessions. The community should have some pull as well on the resources that are rightfully theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the appeal made by my colleagues for the Minister to think carefully. The amendment is in the best interests of the House of Commons and democracy and I hope that it will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Den Dover 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chorley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) and Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) seem to be under the illusion that the Secretary of State will deal personally with the house developer who wants to buy a plot of land. That is not the case. The developer will deal with the commission, which will seek the general or special authority of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will not do a straight deal with the developer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I condemn the views of those who talk about Barratts as though it were a twopenny-halfpenny builder. It is the largest house builder in the country. In my constituency it has had more than a dozen sites and has added to the amenities of the area. It is not true that Barratts put up rabbit hutches. The proof of the pudding is whether its houses sell. Many customers are extremely happy and are enjoying fruitful lives in Barratts houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It comes as no surprise to the hon.

The Committee will known with what assiduity I study legislation passed by the Labour party. The rock upon which all new town legislation has been built was that which was placed in position by the father of the present shadow Leader of the House of Commons. I think the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) was in the House in 1946.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie W. Hamilton	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to level a charge at the hon. Gentleman which I shall not now do. I know that he has been an hon. Member for a long time. However, for the sake of accuracy I have before me a copy of the New Towns Act 1946. What do I read in section 4? I read something far more extravagant than the modest proposals contained in clause 1. I shall read from the section for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman. Section 4(1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The development corporation established for the purposes of a new town may, with the consent of the Minister, acquire … or may be authorised by means of a compulsory purchase order … to acquire compulsorily, any land within the area designated under this Act ".</p></blockquote>
That is a pretty sweeping power to have been conferred upon the Minister for Town and Country Planning as he then was. Section 5 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Subject to any directions given by the Minister under this Act, the development corporation established for the purposes of a new town may dispose of any land acquired by them ".</p></blockquote>
I read on because I do not want to be guilty of selectivity: section 6(3) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>" It shall be the duty of the Minister to give to any development corporation established under this Act such directions with respect to the disposal of land acquired
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
by them thereunder … as appear to him to be necessary or expedient ".</p></blockquote>
The powers which were conferred upon a Socialist Minister by the Labour-controlled Parliament of 1945 were very much greater than those that we seek to confer upon my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not want to go back as far as 1946. We come to a period when certainly the hon. Member for Fife, Central was with us. His hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) had just left the Department of Employment, where he had been wreaking much havoc, in the company of the right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot), in conferring privileges and immunities upon the trade union movement of an unjustified and unjustifiable kind. He left the Department of Employment and went to the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection. I think that he was at that Department when inflation rose to its highest level ever-26-9 per cent. I think the hon. Gentleman was there, but I give way to him if I have got the date wrong. I do not want to be diverted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Crown Agents Act 1979. The hon. Member for Fife, Central may say, " was not 1979 the year of change of Government? " Most certainly it was. But the Crown Agents Act received the Royal Assent on 4 April 1979. I remind the Committee of the powers that were conferred on the Minister under the provisions of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 5(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" (3) The following powers of the Crown Agents under subsection (1), namely—
	<ol>
	<li>the power under subsection (1)(a) to procure movable property in pursuance of subsection (2)(l);</li>
	<li>the power under subsection (1)(a) to provide any of the services mentioned in subsection (2)(m);</li>
	<li>the power under subsection (1)(a) to provide credit as mentioned in subsection (2)(n)(ii);</li>
	<li>the power under subsection (1)(b) to procure movable property; and</li>
	<li>the power under subsection (1)(b) to sell property procured under subsection (1)(b) to a person other than a schedule authority or body,</li>
</ol>
shall be exerciseable only with the consent of the Minister."</p></blockquote>
That was another occasion when great powers were conferred upon the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge has an engaging quality, which I began to respect several years ago, of treating every issue on every amendment to every clause of every Bill as being one of the higest moral principle. By his selectivity in applying those high moral principles and his invitation to Conservative Members to abandon their deeply-held conviction in support of the Bill, the hon. Gentleman was trying to seduce my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commitment of my hon. Friends to the purposes set out in the Bill will not be weakened, even by the eloquence of the hon. Gentleman. I have shown that the proposals in the clause that concern the powers of my right hon. Friend are modest—especially when compared with the precedent of far more immodest Labour legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming very worried. I was about to go outside to shake myself because I found myself agreeing with almost every word of the Minister's preamble. When Opposition Members start to agree with a Minister, they should go outside and shake themselves in case the agreement becomes catching and spreads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as the Minister continued it became obvious that the agreement was not catching and that it certainly would not spread. The Minister seemed to be saying, " Ah, but others have done this, so my sin is not so bad." In my opening remarks I referred to all Secretaries of State. Whether they served in 1946 or 1898 or whether they will be here in 1990, my position is the same. Far too much legislation is taken away from hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall when the Minister used to argue as I do. I wonder what has changed his mind. I remember listening for hours to a debate on a transport Bill and enjoying the hon. Gentleman's eloquence. He used to argue this case on behalf of the then Opposition consistently and well—so well that he converted me to his belief that Secretaries of State should not have these powers. I still support that cause. Where did the Minister get lost along the road? It was his eloquence and the way he put his case for fighting the bureaucracy that inspired a young greenhorn to Parliament to say, " My goodness, that man has a point." I still have that point—where did the Minister lose it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can read the Minister's speeches in awe. I once had the privilege of listening to him argue for about two and three quarter hours on this point before he reached the main part of his speech. Those two and three quarter hours were par excellence about why the powers of ordinary Members of Parliament should not be given away lightly. The Minister said that everthing should return to the House. I thought, " There is a man. He is on the opposite side to me, but I agree with him." The Minister has been lost along the line somewhere, perhaps because the power being given away may go to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said, quite correctly, that I was trying—I have not given up yet—to seduce his hon. Friends. But I learnt that device from him. In Committee after Committee, his speeches appealed to those who were then Government Members to join him. His arms were flung wide and he said, " Come and join us." This is one of the principles on which he wanted us to join him. I would have joined him, but he sat down too quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members read the report of that Committee they will see that I was advancing the same arguments then. I have always said that if Secretries of State have a case, they should debate it in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell me, a new Member, in how many cases Labour party Members voted against their own Government on an issue which they felt so strongly. An answer to that question would help me enormously in my judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that that happened more often than is likely to happen in this Committee. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. I am one of those hon. Members it is on the record. Perhaps it would not be a bad beginning for the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth), as a new hon. Member to start as I did, by voting against my own Government on a point of principle. To do so clarifies one's mind and the minds of other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of principle is made. As is normal in Committee, I have set out to try to help the Minister —I always do. If the amendment is carried, a considerable load will be lifted from his shoulders. He will not have to sit up till the early hours of the morning worrying about this or that decision. Of course, he will have to make a case for any of his decisions, and we can all hear the case. If he has a good case, and he is right, he has nothing to worry about; if he has a bad case, and he is wrong, we will have the chance to do something about it. That is the power being taken away by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is a very good one. It does not destroy the principle or the dogmatic policy behind the Minister's Bill, so he cannot use that argument. However, the amendment would return power to all Members of Parliament and should recommend itself across the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will have the pressure lifted from his shoulders. There will be no suggestion, however remote, that anything could happen while he was making a decision, or that any pressure could be brought to bear on him to make a decision. He would know, as would everyone else, that those making the decision were the representatives of the people. That is what true democracy is about. We are not elected to come here and give power away to one individual. I am against giving power to individuals, because the logical conclusion of that argument is that we shall have one Secretary of State —or one Prime Minister—and a computer, and the rest of us will be redundant. That is not democratic and never will be. If we carry the amendment, we shall have struck a blow for ordinary, individual Members of Parliament and, more importantly, will have safeguarded the interests of those outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie W. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist the temptation to respond to some of the Minister's comments. He referred to the length of my service in the House, He, too, has a record, and it has been fascinating to watch him in his various incarnations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the Minister as the acid performer on the Opposition Benches before 1979. I watched him ascend from the depths when he was the ticktack man for the Prime Minister to the dizzy heights that he has now attained. He is a different man—a chameleon politician. He is now almost humorous in his careful selection of quotes dug out for him by civil servants in his Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The diffeernce between powers taken by Labour and Tory Governments is simple but profound. A Labour Government took powers to protect the public interest and public assets from the deprivations of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
speculators and private profiteers. Now it is the opposite: the Government are taking powers to flog off to private profiteers all kinds of public assets in the new towns and elsewhere. That is the fundamental but simple reason for the difference between the powers aggregated to themselves by Labour Ministers and those being taken by Conservative Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) asked a question, which I shall repeat. Can the Minister give an assurance that when he exercises the powers contained in lines 39 and 40 he will be under an obligation to come to Parliament and say why he has exercised
	<br><blockquote><p>" the general or special authority "</p></blockquote>
given to the Secretary of State in those lines? There is no such obligation. It is government by deception. It is secret government. It is government by a complete lack of accountability to Parliament or to anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to Barratts. Remarks made by the Minister and his hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) are counter to the facts. The Minister is now presiding over the decimation of the public housing sector. New towns in Scotland and, I believe, in England are now prevented from building any houses to rent. That has been the case in Scotland for the past few years. Houses are built only for sale. That is why newly married young couples have no alternative but to go to firms such as Barratts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that I have received a disturbing letter from a woman in Glasgow, which I shall read to the Committee at some time during our proceedings. All her savings have gone down the drain because Barratts has its hands around her threat. I received another letter only this morning—I shall put it on record in due course—from a highly qualified constituent in the building trade. He has given me chapter and verse about houses built by that firm in Glenrothes that are a fire hazard and well below the standards laid down in building regulations. Those regulations are in the process of being abolished by the Scottish Office, and Barratts can then build houses of an even worse quality. Yet those houses will be sold because no houses are being built to rent. The letter that I received from Glasgow yesterday underlined that fact. That woman bought a house and now finds herself saddled with debt for the rest of her life. That is the kind of problem that will arise under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government take these powers, there will be virtual dictatorship by legislation. The Minister is being given the power to privatise and sell off whatever he thinks appropriate and will not have to return to Parliament and defend what he has done. It is deplorable, and the Minister's light touch cannot hide that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite apart from the fact that the Minister does not have to defend his actions to Par

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am saying Under the provision, the Minister has the power to do what he likes without defending, explaining of justifying his action to Parliament. My hon. Friend will recollect the case of Hamilton college in which the Public Accounts Committee became involved after the event. But that is crying over spilt milk. It was too late then. The Minister concerned is still in the Government. When he was in the Scottish Office he flogged off public assets at a cost of millions of pounds to the public purse, and he is still parading happily around in the consumers affairs division of the Department of Trade and Industry. He could not run a toffee shop, but he is a Minister with great power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister for Housing and Construction will withdraw the provision and get those clever people who advise him to find a form of words that makes him or any other Minister more accountable to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even new Members learn fairly quickly that they must not be provoked by Opposition Members. I follow that rule myself, but on this occasion I feel obliged to comment on the words of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). There are occasions when outrageous statements cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, and this is one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two observations on the subject of Barratts, which seems to haunt Opposition Members. Barratts is not perfect. No institution in society, whether commercial or public, is perfect, and Barratts certainly is not. I do not say that there are no causes for complaints to be levelled against a company of that size and with that range and volume of activitie &
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies such as Barratts have given many young people and young couples the opportunity to own their own homes. I am astonished by the suggestion that there is something evil or undesirable about that. However much it may be regretted by Opposition Members, young people want the opportunity to own their own homes. The idea that being denied the opportunity to rent but being given the opportunity to buy is bad cannot go unchallenged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that people who buy their own homes have endless causes for complaint, that they lose their money and assets, but that all is well for those who buy public sector housing. That is nonsense. For every letter that the hon. Gentleman produces to support that argument, I can produce one from a constituent telling a horrendous story of neglect and abuse by a public authority of the housing in which he lives. However, that would be a futile exercise, and I do not propose to indulge in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not accept the argument put forward by Opposition Members. Their eloquence has not yet dented my resolve to support the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

rather than individual building companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that valid point, Sir Philip, but my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) re-entered the debate because of comments made by a Conservative Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked his Back Benchers not to listen to the appeals to them from my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) to vote with the Opposition to ensure that the Secretary of State did not have powers which, rightly, should be those only of Parliament. I hope that Conservative Members bear it in mind that the Minister had to appeal to them. If they have any doubts about the value of the amendment, I ask them to think most carefully about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State did not have that all-power authority over Parliament. Like other Secretaries of State and Ministers, this Secretary of State should be answerable to Parliament. The reason for the amendment is to try to ensure that if there is to be any move away from that democratic process, Parliament, not the Secretary of State or the Department of the Environment in Marsham street, should have the right to make that decision. The decision should be vested in Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to what could happen if the clause as written was accepted. It has been said that much credit is due to the fact that young people have been given the oportunity to own their own homes. Perhaps there is some merit in that. No Opposition Member objects to owner-occupation. I underline that. If that clears up the matter for the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth), some good has come from this discussion. Our argument has been that there should be fair opportunities. But, under this Government, there has not been much joy for young people in that respect because of the way in which mortgage rates have been allowed to increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is developing a most interesting theme. Does he agree with his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not in the Chamber when my hon.

We press the Government to give assistance to local authorities when there is a shortage of rented accommodation as only the local authorities can provide such accommoda

tion. That is the background against which we make our argument. When one considers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suspect that this is becoming a debate on general housing policy. I hope that we can address ourselves more precisely to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we do not want to stray from the business before us. If the amendment is not accepted, the subject of housing accommodation in particular and what faces new towns in general could become an issue. Therefore, the points that have been raised are of considerable importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subparagraph (3) (a) refers to the commission not being able to
	<br><blockquote><p>"acquire land or any interest or rights in or over land".</p></blockquote>
We draw the attention of the Committee, and the Minister in particular to that fact that if the amendment is not accepted there are those who could take advantage of having the ear of the Minister or someone in his Department on the acquisition of land in prime areas. The housing company referred to earlier was one about which we have great reservations. My knowledge not only of the types of houses that are built but of the way in which the estates are left afterwards highlights my concern. There is anxiety about this, and the way in which we are fobbed off when we argue on behalf of our constituents increases our anxiousness that the amendments be accepted. Because of what is happening around us, we urge that any matter requiring clarification be brought before Parliament, not left to the people in Marsham Street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the amendment was similar to amendments to past Bills introduced by Labour Ministers. He said that similar provisions were made in those Bills, so there is no reason why they should not be made now. I remind him that he and his colleagues objected at the time to certain powers being given to certain Ministers, and that that has not changed. As Back Bench Members, we are still worried about the powers to be vested in Ministers and their Departments. If the Minister thinks that some of his colleagues might waver, that should provoke him into thinking again about the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge, in introducing the amendment, made clear what it sought to do. The reasons that he gave were plausible and acceptable, and should be taken seriously by the Minister. Certain aspects of his reply suggested a little sympathy with the my hon. Friend. I hope that he will develop that sympathy and accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) was anxious about the effect of the final two lines of the clause. There is no requirement for my right hon. Friend to seek Parliament's authority before exercising the powers set out there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I comment on some of the points raised, because there may have been a misunderstanding of some of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
the purposes of the clause, and, if I have contributed to that, I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ever since legislation relating to new towns has been on the statute book, successive Secretaries of State and Ministers have had powers to give directions about the discharge of functions. That applies notably, of course, to the functions of the commission. It is obliged to comply with directions given to it by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I comment on the controls that are set out in clause 1. First, control over the acquisition of land, or any interests or rights in or over land, is new and parallel to that which exists in section 10 of the 1981 Act over the acquisition of land by development corporations. Subparagraph (b) relates to control over making contributions towards the cost of providing amenities, supplies or services. That control also exists under section 36 of the Act. The Bill restates it, so that all the controls are listed together and also removes the present requirement for the concurrence of the Treasury as well as the approval of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. We are moving away—mercifully, some members of the Committee may think—from involving the Treasury in such detailed decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subparagraph (c) relates to loans or advances or the giving of guarantees. That control is now stated in statute for the first time. However, my right hon. Friend has for some time laid down rules on those subjects as part of his supervision of new town finances. Subparagraph (d) relates to control over the development of land and already exists under section 37 of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subparagraph (e) relates to the control over gifts and disposals at a consideration less than the best reasonably obtainable, which is where there may have been misunderstanding. I want to make it clear that there are some instances when, for charitable purposes—I shall give just two illustrations—it may be reasonable to dispose of land at other than best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be areas of land that are transferred free of charge to some other authority, to be looked after. For example, we hope that the Castle Eden Dene nature reserve at Peterlee will be transferred to the Nature Conservancy Council. Furthermore, there are long-established practices whereby new town land can be sold at special prices—in other words, greatly reduced prices—for the construction of places of worship, and to local authorities so that they can carry out some of their functions. In such instances, it should be possible for the Secretary of State to give his consent to a disposal that otherwise would be prohibited under the Bill. I fully understand the force with which Opposition Members have argued for the amendment, but I cannot advise the Committee to agree to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made out a case for when land could be given away as a gift; there is no disagreement about that. But the problem is that such circumstances are not written into the Bill. There is no doubt that the House would agree with
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the points that he made. However, why does an inherent fear that they cannot trust Members of Parliament seem to afflict Ministers? I readily agree that there will be instances when the policy mentioned by the Minister is right, proper and—dare I say it?—expedient. All I am saying is, " Yes, Minister, but please talk to Members on the issue. If you make out your case, we shall agree with it, but do not take that divine right upon yourself." For that reason, I wish to press the amendment to a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dover</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a question that is of great importance to the people of central Lancashire. We believe that the new town has been over-developed—to use my hon. Friend's own words. Large tracts of land have been given planning approval by the development corporation. Under the Bill, assets of a new town can be sold by the Commission for the New Towns. Later, however, the commission will be wound up. If such land is not needed for development, would the provisions of the clause be those under which a price for the land could be obtained by its being passed to local farmers, local authorities or local landholders? Does my hon. Friend consider that the clause is the very provision that might be invoked?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 1, there is a general prohibition on the commission carrying out some acts, which, as my hon.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to declare an interest. For many years my family has been associated with Lewis Silkin, and I still practise under the name Lewis Silkin. Indeed, I was articled to him in 1954 —20 years after he became the first Labour chairman of the old London county council housing committee. Therefore, I suppose my association with town planning—the father of the English new towns—goes back a long way. I also received great political inspiration as Lewis Silkin used to give me advice. He was not a man to speak a great deal, but when he did, he spoke wisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first became a Member of Parliament, he advised me that often one would vote for things in which one did not believe—or agree with wholly. He said that the wisest approach was simply to vote and say nothing. The most imprudent approach, which some Tory Members take on Friday mornings, is both to vote and speak for something in which they do not believe. I have taken his advice as seriously as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lewis Silkin believed strongly in three things, which are no less important today than they were 50 years ago or in 1945 when he became the Minister resposible for town and country planning. One was the necessity of providing the country with good housing and another the overwhelming belief that it is the community which brings about an increase in the value of land and, therefore, that that increase, which is attributable to the activities of the community, should belong to the community and not to private individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fortune to be made in this country and in the United States by those who manipulate the community to put the value of land in their own hands. The greates example was the enclosure Acts. There is a poem that says we call a thief a man who steals a goose from off the common, but the thieves go loose who steal the common off the goose. Fortunes were made in this country by stealing land from working people during the time of the enclosure Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lewis Silkin believed in devoting the increment in the value of land to the community. He believed in town planning, which Lord Abercrombie described as the provision of health, beauty and convenience. Those words are partly reflected in clause 1 in the phrase " convenience and welfare ". Unfortunately, beauty appears to have been omitted from the Bill by the Minister for Housing and Construction although the word beauty was part of the three tenents of town planning when it was all the rage in 1945.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of housing, the return of the increment in the value of land and good planning came
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
together in the concept of new towns. The first generation of new towns in this country was a brilliant British innovation which was the envy of other countries. In some cases the new towns were badly copied, for example in Brasilia and an abortive new town that is being constructed in Nigeria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first generation of new towns did a great deal to provide massess of accumulated capital for the community, but not for private individuals. If we had given the power to develop new towns to property companies, no doubt they would have done so—but at immense gain to a few people who would have done nothing to deserve it. Instead the first generation of new towns made great capital increments to the advantage of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong at this stage to dispose of those accumulated community assets. The disposal of those assets would enable third parties who are unaccountable to the community, to exploit residential and business tenants and industrialists. I am in favour of shopkeepers and industrialists being able to buy their own sites. I am in favour, too, of new town tenants being able to buy their own homes. There was a large increase in home ownership in new towns under the last Labour Government, as the Minister will concede.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong that accumulated assets, which can be exploited by demanding rent, should pass into private hands. It is better that they remain in public and accountable hands. That view is shared, increasingly, not only by Socialists but by many commercial people. For many people, the curse of trying to run a business is that the negotiations and monopolistic controls are in the hands of a landlord who is unaccountable because one cannot get to the boardroom of large property companies. The ownership of rented commercial and residential land should remain in public hands. Therefore, I am opposed to the ability and the encouragement of the commission to dispose of its properties on the private market. Those assets should remain in public hands, preferably those of democratic bodies such as local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, which is a preliminary to winding up the Commission for the New Towns, gives the impression that the idea and concept of new towns has reached its maturity and is coming to an end. In a way, the new towns have played a trick on the cities. The concept of new towns, especially those around London, was rather like the words on the Statue of Liberty about the yearning masses and the poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lewis Silkin felt deeply that the yearning masses and people living in deprived housing conditions in Stepney, Lambeth and so on would be able to move to green field sites and regenerate their lives, which would lead to health, beauty, convenience and happiness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Towards the 1970s the reverse happened. The new towns played a trick on inner cities by taking away industry which served unskilled and semi-skilled workers. My borough lost a large packing depot

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
to Swindon, Tannoy Rentals Ltd., the famous manufacturers of sound reproduction equipment, to Livingston new town and a telephone manufacturing company to another new town. Advancing, highly technological firms such as those left the inner cities for the new towns, taking neither the unemployed nor the unskilled with them. One of the contributory causes of decline in the inner city in London could be ascribed to the success of the new towns around it. It is ironic that what the new towns set out to solve they eventually created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not undermining the success of the new towns, but the task that they set out to achieve in 1945–50 to provide decent housing and living conditions has not been completed. Therefore, we wish to see the recycling of the assets, advantages and expertise of the new towns back into the centres of our cities which they intended to help initially in the 1940s and 1950s. That task of preserving for the community the increased value of land is not finished, and needs to be continued. The provision of decent housing and employment must start afresh where the inspiration of the new towns idea began in the 1940s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Bill has been drafted carefully and that that was why he did not want to accept our amendments. I accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
that, but I wonder whether that is so in regard to amendment No. 3, or whether a mistake has been made in the drafting of the Bill. I shall give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and assume that a mistake has been made and that half way through my speech he will leap to his feet and say that I am correct, that he has made a mistake and that he will accept the amendments. We shall then get off to an early lunch. I am always a super optimist, but I never reach the point where my optimism is fulfilled. However, I still keep trying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather sceptical about anything new in the House and I never cease to be amazed. I assume that everyone has read the clause and has examined the proposed new paragraph 7(1) to schedule 9 to the New Towns Act 1981. Under the heading " Power to dissolve Commission ", that proposed paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If at any time it appears to the Secretary of State that the purposes for which the Commission exists under this Act have been substantially achieved, he may, by order, on such day as he may appoint—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) terminate the exercise by the Commission of its functions except for the purpose of winding-up its affairs;…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) extinguish any liability of the Commission in respect of money lent or advanced at any time by the Secretary of State to any development corporation or to the Commission".</p></blockquote>
That is not significant in itself, but it becomes very significant in the proposed sub-paragraph (6), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No order under this paragraph containing provision for the purpose specified in sub-paragraph (1)(a) or (c) above shall be made unless a draft of it has been laid before Parliament and approved by resolution of each House."</p></blockquote>
As that is exactly what we asked for in the previous amendment, hon. Members may wonder why I am arguing about it. It is significant that the Secretary of State does not have to go to both Houses of Parliament to " vest in himself ". The proposed new paragraph 7(1)(b) states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"vest in himself, any other Minister of the Crown or any accountable public authority any property, rights, liabilities or obligations of the Commission".</p></blockquote>
I shall come to " any accountable public authority " in a moment. Is it not significant that, in drafting the Bill, the Secretary of State realises the power of the argument that an order should be laid and agreed by both Houses except when he vests in himself or any other Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should that be left out? The Secretary of State may not want to go to the House if he is vesting in himself or any other Minister, but I believe that he has an obligation to do so. Who knows what he may vest in himself? When will the House know if he vests in himself? We shall certainly know if he terminates the commission or extinguishes any liability because we shall have the opportunity to debate those issues. The Secretary of State will lay a draft order and both Houses will have to agree it. What hidden meaning is there in " vest in himself "?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply suspicious when I read legislation because legislation has to be dealt with by those outside long after we put it into an Act. Ministers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
come, Ministers go. Any provision that allows a Minister to vest what are ostensibly public assets, provided out of public money, in himself or any other Minister, should be debated. The House should be aware of such a measure and should have the opportunity to challenge it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may very well get his way. With large majorities, Ministers are apt to get their way. But it does not remove the obligation to examine what is being vested in a Minister, or in which Minister. We could argue that these things are being vested in the wrong Minister. We will never know, because we will never have the opportunity to debate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister would be wise to accept amendment No. 4, which simply places new paragraph 7(1)(b) in his own category of the matters that must come before the House. I can envisage in the distant future or the near future, depending on when the measure is to be exercised—deep feelings arising about matters being vested in this, or any other, Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My seduction hat has not been very successful, but I did notice the Minister responding and seducing his hon. Friends. I give him full credit for that. He is more successful than I am. I shall watch him in future, as no doubt I shall pick up some hints about seduction that I have missed in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the Minister's hon. Friends may wish to question him. The hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Dover) used the Committee to ask questions of the Minister. That was right and proper. But what he forgot was that if he supported the amendment, he would be able to ask the Minister questions for the next 20 years. There may not always be Committee available to enable the hon. Gentleman to raise questions and get the answers on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chorley may want to talk about his new town and the Minister vesting some part of the land in himself. I know about Conservative Members' disbelief in the disposal of land. Does the hon. Member for Charley realise that he will have no opportunity whatsoever to question such a move? Unless the Committee accepts the amendment, such matters will go through on the nod, and unless we are careful we will know nothing about it. But if we carry the amendment, they will come before both Houses in the form of an order, and there will be an opportunity to ask questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps one day the hon. Member for Chorley or the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) will be walking round their constituencies and someone will come up and say, " Hello, did you know that that large chunk of land that you were seeking for private development has gone to the Ministry of Defence for some reason? " They will say that they did not know. But I could produce a copy of the report of this Committee, and say to the hon. Gentlemen, " If you had used your heads and voted with us on the amendment, not only would you have known about it, you would have had an opportunity to question it and do something about it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
It seems, Sir Philip, that rebellion is growing on the Government Benches these days. To prevent you putting your careers in jeopardy and having to rebel, why do you not support the amendment? You would be able to speak on the Floor of the House on the amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not for the Chair to support, or otherwise, an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand rebuked, Sir Philip. Sometimes. I wish that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the nub of the amendment. I cannot see why the Secretary of State should have any strong feelings about putting whatever he intends to vest into an order, so that the House can debate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 deals with another matter in new paragraph 7(1)(b). If Conservative Members do not agree with us on that point, surely they will agree with us on the next point. The Minister can vest the public's assets not only in himself—without any Member of Parliament being any the wiser or having the chance to debate the matter—but in that magic phrase, " any accountable public authority ". There are mixed views about what that is. Many Opposition Members would say that it was a local democratically-elected body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when we turn the page—and I never cease to be amazed—we find that the definition of an " accountable public authority " is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any statutory corporation "—</p></blockquote>
and these are the key words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a majority of the members of which are appointed by a Minister of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
Hallelujah. The Secretary of State is virtually ensuring that if it looks a bit sticky to vest the assets in himself, he can pass them over to a body of which he has total and absolute control. If that is not funny goings on—I must be careful, Sir Philip, neither to incur your wrath nor to use unparliamentary expressions—I do not know what is. If the Minister has the courage of his convictions, new paragraph 7(1)(b) would cover it. However, he provides a substantial loophole to take the heat off by giving himself the right to vest the public's assets into a body that he controls absolutely. If those on the " accountable public authority " did not want certain things vested in them, they would look over their shoulder only to see the Minister sitting there and saying, " I appointed you, and a nod and a wink to a blind horse is very clear ". I suspect that when the time came for reappointment there would not be the same keenness—I put it no stronger than that—to reappoint that member of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absolutely disgraceful to vest any public asset in the Minister without debating that. There may be cases where it is justifiable, but it is not justifiable without hon. Members having the opportunity to question it. It is even more of a disgrace considering that these public assets are paid for by the taxpayer. Conservative Members always claim to be defenders of the taxpayers, the ratepayers and so on, and accuse us of doing the opposite. Yet we find
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
ourselves rising to defend the ratepayers and the taxpayers from their defenders. That is remarkably strange. We want to bring a little democracy back into this Bill. We wanted to remove some power from the Minister and we have failed in that. But surely the definition of an " accountable public authority " should be a local, democratically-elected authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill as it is drafted, an " accountable public authority " is accountable only to the Minister. Moreover, unfortunately through lack of deep thought by Conservative Members, we have already given him far too much power. Now we are giving him even more power. That is fundamentally wrong. The " accountable public authority " will be accountable only to a Minister of the Crown that is wrong and should not be allowed to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall, therefore, listen very carefully to the Minister, but it will take a great deal—and I mean a great deal—to convince me that, without these amendments, the Bill provides for any accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the start of today's sitting my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) has, in arguing from his amendments, exposed the powers that the Bill seeks for the Secretary of State. The amendment exposes the weakness in the clause where the Bill provides that anyone or any organisation, with the exception of the Minister, should have the approval of Parliament under a resolution of each House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a reason why the Bill is drafted to give the almighty power to the Minister or to his Department. Perhaps the Minister will tell us why later. The amendment highlights weaknesses in the Bill and provides the opportunity to place some responsibility with Parliament and with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 seeks the deletion of
	<br><blockquote><p>"any statutory corporation a majority of the members of which are appointed by a Minister of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
and seeks instead a reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a democratically elected local authority."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would help the communities involved with the results of the Bill. We have talked about the fears that can develop through the hiving off of parcels of land or properties that are at present owned by the new towns. If we do not pass the amendment, we deny communities the opportunity to look after and to have an interest in their own destinies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives little or no impression that people in the new towns will have any say in their futures. Amendment No. 5 tries to ensure that some input will be afforded to the democratically-elected local authorities. Allowing councils to become involved would also encourage further development of the communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Dormand) quoted from an earlier debate in Parliament on the new towns. He said that the Under-Secretary of State had said then:
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should like to pay tribute to the continuing achievement of the new towns in creating employment. Over the past few years they have sustained a remarkable performance of creating 20,000 or so new jobs a year".—[Official Report, 20 November 1984; Vol. 68, c. 216.]</p></blockquote>
The crux of the amendment is that we should allow the democratically-elected authorities to continue to try and stimulate new job opportunities in their areas and new interests in the community. Our amendment would allow that to continue. My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge was right to table it. New paragraph 7(7) states that the " accountable public authority " is an authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"a majority of the members of which are appointed by a Minister of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
That is a special provision to explain the authority to people who read the Bill. The phrase " accountable public authority " is used only once, in paragraph 7(l)(b), but the Minister thinks it necessary to explain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who reads that would think that an accountable public authority is someone who is accountable to the public. We usually interpret that accountability as being operated through the ballot box, and not through the Minister's office. So much has been said about accountability during the miners' dispute that I wonder whether, instead of the Government being accountable to the public, the public will be accountable to Ministers. Unless we accept that public accountability refers to those elected by the public, we are moving away from the fabric of democracy with which people in this country have grown up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain how the paragraph can refer to an " accountable public authority " when the majority of members will be appointed by the Minister, and accountable only to him? If we are to be honest to the House, to those involved and to those who will serve on these bodies, the provision should be rephrased to show that they are accountable to the Minister and not to the public. Perhaps we should take it that the Minister is now the public, that those who I and other hon. Members serve are no longer the public, and that everyone is answerable to the Minister. That is wrong. It is not in the best interests of the House or of the people who will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their destinies will be controlled by many of these bodies—which are interpreted as being accountable to the public, but which are accountable only to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will explain how a body that is publicly accountable can be responsible only to the Minister and not to the public. The powers of the Secretary of State should be reconsidered. The Secretary of State and Ministers are seeking greater powers over the people who will be appointed to public bodies. My hon. Friend said that if a person appointed by the Minister acts awkwardly, he can be removed from that committee when his reappointment is considered. I remind my hon. Friend that when health authorities have objected to ministerial diktats, the Minister has not waited until a person has come up for re-election; action has been taken against him beforehand. It is clear that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
will be similarities with appointments to this type of public body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be dangerous if we found ourselves in a position in which people who have the community's interest at heart, and who believe that certain actions should be taken in its interests, are not allowed to put their point of view. Such a person will be looking over his shoulder and thinking, " The Minister appointed me. I am responsible to him. He is my maker and the almighty " on this issue. It is doubtful whether the word " democracy " will ever apply again if legislation is allowed to continue in this form. This type of legislation which takes away the power of democratically elected authorities, highlights the great divide between the Tory and Labour parties. The Tory party wants to do away with everything public, and in which it has no interest. We believe that at some time the House must realise that there is a need for members of the public to have a say in what happens in communities. The purpose of our amendment is to try to introduce reason and allow some say by the public in what is happening in their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider the amendments carefully. We have tried to explain in detail the genuine concern behind the amendments, which were tabled to benefit the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Mr John Stradling Thomas)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) said more than once that he would take some convincing. I shall have a silver tongue if I succeed in convincing him, but I will do my humble best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a misapprehension among hon. Members, especially the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). We moved from clause 1, which related to changing the commission's functions, to clause 2, which relates to the power to dissolve the commission. We are far from being undemocratic. The hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser), in his most interesting speech, referred to the patrimony, so to speak, of the new towns legislation. It was always envisaged that eventually the corporations and the commission would be wound down and everything handed over to democratic control. Therefore, a misapprehension underlies the tabling of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first amendment relates to the bringing of the orders of the Secretary of State transferring property rights, liabilities or obligations of the Commission for New Towns, when it is wound up, under specific parliamentary control. I wish to stress that the matters that we are discussing are very much residual matters. Most will be dealt with by negotiation, agreement and transfer in the normal way. It has been done for other new towns and will proceed in this way. Housing, as the Committee knows, will be transferred, by agreement, to local authorities—to democratic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment seeks to change the definition of the term " accountable public authority ". I am not sure, if the hon. Member for Normanton
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
were to consult local authorities, whether they would altogether welcome the main arguments for the two amendments. The Bill only specifies certain sorts of orders that would be required on the winding-up of the commission as subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. These are the orders to
	<br><blockquote><p>"terminate the exercise by the Commission of its functions except for the purpose of winding-up its affairs ".</p></blockquote>
The orders will also write off outstanding National Loans Fund advances that are still the responsibility of the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked whether we had consulted local authorities about our amendments. Have local authority associations been consulted on the Bill's provisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stradling Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not to my knowledge. The decision to
	<br><blockquote><p>"terminate the exercise by the Commission of its functions"</p></blockquote>
is a fundamental decision. It has been enshrined in principle and I believe that it is acceptable to both sides. The writing off of public debt is of sufficient significance to be considered by Parliament, but the transfer of property rights, liabilities and obligations is clearly a consequential matter. I would expect that most, if not all, of the necessary provisions would be included in the same order as the other aspects. However, it may be more convenient to deal with some elements separately. If the amendments were accepted, there would be a danger of Parliament dabbling in operational matters that it cannot handle with any efficacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament has proved the basic principle so it seems unnecessary to subject detailed transfers to the same degree of control. I do not rest that on administrative convenience. The second amendment misunderstands the underlying situation at which the provisions are aimed. Further, it would place local authorities in a position in which we are sure they would prefer not to be. Transfers to local authorities are not mentioned in the clause because it is assumed—there are good grounds for that assumption—that any property appropriate for transfer to the local authority will be transferred to them by the commission by agreement under its general powers of disposal. Therefore, those matters will be brought under democratic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the compulsory transfer of the remaining assets and liabilities of the commission when it is wound up. The transfer will take place by unilateral effect of the order. While there will doubtless be discussions about the transfer, the final decision will rest with the Secretary of State. Even if the order is made subject to the affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament, a local authority would be in a weak position under the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That position should be constrasted with the position under the provisions regarding transfer from development corporations to local authorities in the original 1946 Act. Even though there was provision for compulsory transfer, that could be done only by an order and would have led to what would amount
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
to a private Bill procedure. We all know how cumbersome and costly that can be. With the arrangement under housing transfer, the initial onus is on the new town corporation and the local authority to agree an acceptable scheme between themselves—even though, if they fail, there is a power for the Secretary of State to make a housing transfer scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also make it possible for the liabilities of the Commission for the New Towns to be transferred to a local authority against its will. I do not think that it would like that much; with no counter-balancing assets, that would not be a very attractive proposition. Of course, it might be attractive to those charged with the responsibility for winding up the Commission for the New Towns, but that is not our policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I call on my hon. Friends and Opposition Members, if my tongue has touched sufficient silver, to accept that the amendment is, therefore, misconceived. The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge said that there was some deep significance and hidden meaning. I mentioned earlier that he would take some convincing on the point, but I hope that I have been able to do that. Orders would be involved in this respect only when the commission was unable to agree a satisfactory disposal of assets and liabilities with some other body. Therefore, it seems to me appropriate that central Government—or a body under their control, as was suggested—should take over the responsibility. I urge the Committee not to support the amendment; I believe that the hon. Gentleman's suspicion is ill-founded and misconceived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, for whom I have great respect, advanced some persuasive arguments, except in one respect. All I am asking in amendment No. 4—I am not trying to take anything away —is, " Is this a private fight, or can anyone else join in? " If a power is subject to resolution by both Houses, hon. Members will agree to it provided that it is right. That would remove any suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not demanding an enormous change to the Bill, but only the right of Members of Parlia
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
ment to know what is going on and to be able to question and discuss it. The Minister knows as well as I do that the Government will get their way and that the powers in respect of the land and other property will be vested in the Secretary of State. But after all, the right to raise questions and debate matters is a reason why we are in the House of Commons and in this Committee Room. Now we are begging for the right of hon. Members to have the opportunity on this issue to represent properly the people who sent us here. Of course, the Government will carry the vote on the amendment, but they will not do so without questions and discussion by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept much of what the Minister said about democratically-elected local authorities. But it was a little strange when he suggested that local authorities might not like such-and-such a policy and then admitted that no one had thought to ask them. Surely his case would have been strengthened if he had said, " We have consulted the local authorities on these matters, and some have informed us that they do not want to see such a course of action." No doubt that would be true in certain instances, but let me try to overcome such a dilemma for the Government: the problem would occur only if the Secretary of State exercised his second option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new schedule 9(7)(1)(b) says that the Secretary of State may
	<br><blockquote><p>"vest in himself, any other Minister of the Crown or any accountable public authority "</p></blockquote>
the property, and so on, of the commission. Therefore, if the second amendment and the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"a democratically elected local authority"</p></blockquote>
were carried, the Secretary of State would be able to say, " We have this asset. Would you like to take it over—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
