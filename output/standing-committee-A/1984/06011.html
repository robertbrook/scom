	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 7, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(2A) The Agency shall offer appointments and employment to all suitable persons at present employed by the British National Oil Corporation; and if either the Agency or the person or persons concerned are unable to agree terms of appointment for employment the person or persons shall receive the same terms of severance and redundancy as others appointed to and employed by the British National Oil Corporation.".</p></q>
When we debated the sittings motion at our first sitting I said that I wished to raise the question of the effect of the Bill on the status and future of BNOC staff. You drew my attention, Mr. Knox, to the fact that I could not take that issue very far while we were discussing the sittings motion and so I was encouraged to find a way to raise the matter and to move an amendment to give some protection to the staff, which I feel is more than justified. Amendment No. 30 aims to give that protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth recalling the background and the events that have led up to the present position. At our first sitting I pointed out that Opposition Members felt that if there had not been a reneging, there had been at least a dissipation of what appeared to be a clear and unequivocal assurance that I had received on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the matter on Second Reading for the express purpose of trying to safeguard the position of some members of BNOC staff who would not wish to transfer to the agency, and the manner in which I did that is recorded in the 	<i>Official Report</i> at the foot of column 201 and the top of column 202. Had I thought that there would be an attempt to wriggle out of commitments made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary when he replied, I should have worded my request differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipated the problem that might arise when some members of staff, particularly those employed in the land pipelines division of BNOC, were forced to transfer to the agency and would not be offered redundancy terms or conditions of service that were satisfactory to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot easily intervene in a winding up speech to obtain clarification, but in any case I felt that the Under-Secretary gave a reassuring response. He said that the Government had
	<br><q><p>"neither means nor intention of forcing BNOC staff to transfer."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c. 253.]</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
He said that staff would be offered jobs, but there would be no intention of forcing them to transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the context in Which the matter had been raised and because the Minister understood the worries of staff, I took comfort from that assurance, as did the staff of BNOC. So it was a surprise to hear that within a day or so of Second Reading some BNOC staff were told that the Bill provided for their transfer to the new agency and that their contracts of employment would be transferred. Certain members of staff were told that they would have to go or resign, without the right to the severance or redundancy terms that were being offered to other members of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision for the transfer of contracts of employment is made in paragraph 2	<i>(a)</i> of schedule 2, which states:
	<br><q><p>"the effect of section 3 of this Act in relation to any contract of employment with the Corporation in force immediately before the transfer date is merely to modify the contract (as from that date) by substituting the Agency as the employer (and not to terminate the contract or vary it in any other way)".</p></q>
When I first read that, I assumed it was meant to ensure that people would not have worse terms and conditions of employment, and would not be disadvantaged. However, they are being disadvantaged by the insistence that certain members of staff must either go across or resign, as the Minister put the choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"Schedule 2(2) makes provision for the contracts of employment of BNOC staff to be transferred in their entirety to the agency, so that the employees' terms and conditions are not adversely affected by the transfer."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c.195.]</p></q>
The transfer of staff from the corporation to the agency, unwillingly or reluctantly, with reduced career opportunities:and worries and concerns about the long-term future of, the agency will have an adverse effect on staff if they are compelled to transfer without being offered an alternative of severence or redundancy or enhanced arrangements for transferring to the agency. That is what amendment No. 30 seeks, to enshrine in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debate on, the sittings motion I referred to the context, environment, and background of the problems that the staff have faced, and I should like to deal with that in more detail now. Uncertanty and worries, about, the future of those who have been working in the land pipelines division for the past 12 or 18 months did not start when the Minister announced the abolition of the corporation. The staff had lived and 'worked under an increasingly dark cloud of uncertainty for at least 18 months before the announcement of abolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our discussion on the sittings motion, the Minister revealed—after prompting from Opposition Members—that in the two years or so before the announcement of the. abolition of BNOC, the Government had been reviewing the activities, management structure and the whole land pipelines and storage installation system that is to be transferred to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
Therefore, staff employed in, the land pipelines division of BNOC had been living under that cloud of uncertainty for the best part of 18 months or two years. I ask all fair-minded- Committee members whether they would wish members of staff to endure that and, now, yet another upheaval, without at least being offered the option to accept redundancy and search for employment elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first cloud of uncertainty appeared during our debate on the sittings motion, when the Minister referred to the PA Management Consultant's report which had been prepared over the previous 12 months and sought alternatives to the way in which the land pipelines an & storage installation system was managed. All fair-minded members of the Committee will sureay accept that such a review would create worry and uncertainty about the future in the minds of staff working in that division of BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister revealed, again during the sittings motion debate, that that worry and uncertainty did not end when PA reported. We have still not seen its report; that is a matter we shall raise later. But the Minister told us that there was yet another review after PA's report. I understand that it was conducted by an interdepartmental working group which examined how the pipelines and storage installation system could be privatised. That was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate option to investigate, but nevertheless yet anoher period of uncertainty ensued from the beginning of 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the Department of Energy recognise and acknowledge that a further review, analysis or investigation of the future of the pipelines and installations division of BNOC would create further uncertainty and worry for the staff? I do not know exactly how long the PA report took to prepare, but it must have taken the best part of 12 months. If the Department of Energy' recognised that the subsequent establishment of an interdepartmental working group to examine the possibility of privatising the pipelines and storage installation system would cause further worry to land pipelines staff, what action did it take to allay their fears?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During 1983 and 1984, certain members of BNOC's staff were under perpetual review, and in perpetual uncertainty about their future. Then, after all those reviews, came the bolt from the blue that the corporation was to be abolished and another agency was to be created to assume the responsibilities and functions of the land pipelines division of BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No member of staff could have anticipated that. No Committee member, or, indeed any other hon. Member anticipated it. On 6 March, the Select Committee took evidence from the Minister who gave no indication that he intended to abolish that or any other function of BNOC. The staff could not have expected or prepared for the notion that, in addition to all the worries of the past 18 months to two years, they would be transferred lock, stock and barrel to a new agency with a different remit and a different range of employment and career opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a party point. I ask all fair minded members of the Committee to appreciate the combination of circumstances and unfolding of events that started 18 months ago. The reports and reviews were conducted for the best part of two years and ended with a bolt-from-the-blue decision to abolish BNOC and to transfer sections of its staff to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also worried by the Ministers statement on 14 March. The pressure on him from Conservative Back Benchers about the agency's future is shown by a later amendment tabled by the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) and for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). People take those hon. Gentlemen seriously. Even in the Minister's statement of 14 March, the term used about the transfer of the function of BNOC's land pipelines division to the agency was " in present circumstances ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a capacity for making the hastily cobbled up decisions that the Bill represents and for changing their mind to embark on ill-considered and ill-digested changes. The Minister's term " in present circumstances " did not encourage the staff of BNOC's land pipelines division to believe that there was any permanence in the tasks that they might undertake for a completely new agency with a different environment and career structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the land pipelines division of BNOC were not employed to work only in that division. Their terms and conditions of service and their contracts were with the BNOC, and not with its land pipelines division. They were not recruited solely for the division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to all members of the Committee. If people are engaged under contract to be employed in an oil corporation, the fact that they go to one of its divisions does not mean that they cannot seek and may not be offered alternative career opportunities elsewhere in the corporation. The staff's contracts are with the BNOC and not with the land pipelines division. Their annual performance appraisal documents are not related solely to their activities in one function within the corporation but to their performance as employees of a national oil corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BNOC's terms and conditions handbook is a statement of the fact that people employed by a division of BNOC are employees of the corporation as a whole, not just of one part of it. The Minister should accept that staff should not be asked to transfer across against their wishes. Our amendment seeks to offer them the opportunity to agree new terms of employment or to accept severance and redundancy terms. [Interruption.] I hope that Conservative Members are listening. This affects the future of some of the staff. I am sure that Conservative Members will take care of their own careers, but they should also share the worries of others. I hope that they will at least give that courtesy to the staff, although I can happily raise my voice above the level of conversation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
The terms and condition of employment and the career opportunities of staff related to the oil corporation as a whole, rather than to one part of it. The worry of some BNOC staff obout being transferred against their wishes is being compounded by the worry that the new agency may not be permanent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is BNOC's contractual relationship with the Department of Energy on land pipelines and storage installation system? Is it a permanent, formal contract with provision to terminate it? That is presumably the arrangement which will be transferred to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked back at my notes on the original Act and I understand that the contract is on a year-to-year basis. Is it in the form of a contract or an exchange of letters? Is it formal or informal? What exactly is the contractual basis on which BNOC handles land pipelines and storage installations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If BNOC has no permanent contractual arrangement, that strengthens my case on behalf of the staff who do not wish to be transferred to the agency. That would add to the genuine doubt about the future function and role of the agency in the land pipelines division and to the uncertainty of staff about their career prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In brief, I wish to know the contractual arrangement between BNOC and the Department of Energy for the management function of storage installations and land pipelines. It is a matter of considerable concern. I also wish to know whether in its further review in 1984 the Department of Energy understood and appreciated how much additional uncertainty would be created by continuing reviews of the structure and future of the land pipelines division of BNOC. Under their terms of employment people employed in the land pipelines division were employed not by the division but by BNOC to work in an oil corporation. They could have moved from pipelines to trading, participation or any other function of BNOC. They were not employed to work only in the land pipelines division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no civil lawyer, but I should like the Minister to consider a case mentioned in a law report. Although it was a different situation, the terms of the judgment interested me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case of Bliss v South East Thames regional health authority was reported in The Times law reports of 25 April. I do not want to go into the details, as it concerned an argument between a consultant and his employer, the regional health authority. The appeal court found in favour of the plaintiff on the grounds that:
	<br><q><p>"That breach was a repudiatory breach because, in the circumstances, it was calculated, or likely, to destroy the relationship of confidence and trust which should exist between employer and employee, and that was a fundamental implied term of the particular contract of employment."</p></q>
Those terms are interesting. The key factor in the appeal judge's decision was that a good relationship was a
	<br><q><p>"fundamental implied term of the particular contract of employment."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
If members of staff are to be transferred, unwillingly, from the oil corporation to an agency where there will be no confidence and trust at first between employer and employee, that could be considered a potential breach of contract. Even if it is not strictly SO in, law, surely it is such in terms of the spirit in which hon. Members on both sides have said that they wish BNOC employees to be treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not hopeful that the Minister will accept our amendment. Although we have heard affable words and promises to listen, none of our amendments has been accepted. Most of all, I should like the Minister to accept our amendment, but if he will not do so, I wish to make two requests. If it is felt that the staff of the land pipelines division have to be transferred to a different organisation with a different remit, with. different opportunities for careers and different potential employment, will the most urgent consideration. be. given to enhancing the terms of employment offered to those who have to be transferred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the chiefs, Mr. Vaughan and othsrs are willingly to go across to new managerial positions in a smaller agency than the corporation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will get in " Who's Who ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Besides possibly achieving the status of being included in " Who's Who", as my hon. Friend suggests, have they been offered any different terms of employment—salary, emoluments, allowances, pension. rights and so on—from those they enjoyed as members -of the corporation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the chiefs have been transferred on better terms, the rest of the staff, who are reluctant to move and would have preferred the same terms of severance and redundancy—which we seek for them —should at least have been offered better conditions of service and salaries as some compensation for changing the whole basis of their employment and their career opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would prefer that our amendment be accepted, but if it is not, I hope that the Minister will not hide behind the argument that these are all matters for the corporation and the new agency. I hope that he will not say, It is nothing to do with me. I should not get involved in the nitty gritty of the futures of those affected by my policy decision; they are for the agency and the corporation." If the Minister replies in. those terms, the Opposition will react strongly. Even 'on Second Reading, Ministers accepted their responsibility. The Minister of State said
	<br><q><p>"During April, my light hoe. Friend the Secretary of State met Mr. Roy Grantham the general secretary of the Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff and discussed, the genuine anxieties felt by the staff".—[Official Report, 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c.195.]</p></q>
Members of the staff, on whose behalf I move the amendment, have been told that it is the Bill, and not BNOC, that is forcing them to transfer. Paragraph 2(a) of schedule 2 transfers their contracts of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
employment. The Bill 'is the responsibility not of BNOC or the nascent agency; but of the Minister. It is, therefore, the Mini'ster's duty to sit down with members of the staff to search' for an amicable and sensible solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to asking the Minister whether he has any proposals, for enhanced terms of employment for staff who are reluctantly moving to the new agency, may I ask him whether, as a direct consequence of his clear-cut, unequivocal ministerial responsibility for changing the employment, career prospects and outlook for many members of the staff affected by the policy decisions represented in the Bill, he will accept some responsibility for them. Will he hold discussions with the staff and try to find an amicable solution to their problems?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members will feel that I have moved the amendment in the most reasonable and fair-minded spirit possible, I do not think that many members of the Committee could object to it, and even if the Government are queasy about writing these words into the Bill, let them match the spirit of the amendment in their responses and deeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it was the unanimous view of all present on Second Reading that members of the staff, to whose professionalism and skill Ministers have paid considerable tribute, should be treated as decently and fairly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitated to rise as I thought that the persuasive nature of the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) would have encouraged at least one or two Conservative Members to say a few words in support of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend's view that on. Second Reading the whole House .appeared to support his argument: the staff have. served BNOC well and deserve the consideration of the House. I draw the attention of Conservative Members to the 1984 BNOC report. The second column on page 3 underneath the photograph of Lord Croham states:
	<br><q><p>"if the Corporation had full freedom to operate as a trader, it should not make losses".</p></q>
It continues further on:
	<br><q><p>"but inevitably the profits which had been earned by the hard work of the staff from the succesful development of other activities of the Corporation were washed away in the process."</p></q>
In order to serve the cause of stability in the oil sector BNOC incurred substantial losses in that part of its activities. They were losses due not to its incompetence but entirely to its intervention in pursuit of stability. Other activities were extremely successful. Its record demonstrates that it deserves consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members seemed to be greatly stimulated the other day when we were discussing payment by results. If one measures the performance of the staff of BNOC in any fair way, the results will show that they deserve consideration. I was disappointed that not one Conservative Member even murmured in approval let alone made a speech, albeit a short
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
one. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Ryhmney could unite the entire Committee and it is a pity that Conservative Members have not been more forthcoming in recognising the need for generosity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends point about the staff facing great uncertainty is not unusual in. British society. It may be because it is unusual that the uncertainty has a greater bitterness about it. I shall illustrate that point by referring to a similar case in the public sector which may have contributed enormously to public costs. For some time in 1983 a number of my hon. Friends and I were warning the Government that there could be a strike in the mining industry. In 1983, as a result of public policy, Elsecar colliery which is about 30 or 40 yards outside my constituency boundary was closed. The National Coal Board told 138 men—not a large number of men; similar to the number which the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) was disdaining not very long ago—that it wanted them to transfer to Cortonwood colliery. The men replied that they did not want to go to Cortonwood because they though that it was a short-life pit. That argument is identical to the one here. A number of Conservative Members want the agency to be eradicated within a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to reassure those men, the NCB said that it would give an absolute guarantee that Cortonwood would stay open for at least five years. Some of those men had not even done a shift at Cortonwood colliery when the NCB, which had just guaranteed five years' life, gave it five weeks. That started a strike which cost an enormous amount of money. That is on the record and it is not the only such event on the record. Therefore the uncertainty of people serving in the public sector is greatly magnified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the staff of BNOC the uncertainty may be even greater than for the men employed at Cortonwood. They have not contributed to any losses. Their activities have been enormously successful. If one excludes their oil trading role, their activities in other sectors have been extremely advantageous to the public purse and their material record deserves consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect to consider. Last week the Government introduced a social security review containing new proposals for the welfare state. The Secretary of State for Social Services said that people would have to be responsible for a larger part of their pensions. I do not know how old the agency staff will be, but some of them may be affected by the arrangements, even if those arrangements do not come fully into force until after the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention is that the state contribution to pensions will diminish and that individuals will have to make their own arrangements or have arrangements with their employers. People were already plunged into uncertainty when the Committee started its proceedings, but since then we have had this further development affecting the pensions of some of the agency staff. So the Minister should take serious account of the pension arrangements of the agency's employees
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
We have already talked about the stranglehold of the Treasury on public decision-making, but surely even the Treasury realises that the public purse has benefited from the efforts of BNOC employees. Those employees deserve consideration. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney does not ask for vast expenditure or undue generosity; he asks for reasonable treatment, justified because of the vengeful attitude that Conservative Members take to any part of the public sector. I sometimes feel that Shakespeare's words " do we not bleed? " are appropriate. Those people are as sensitive, necessitous and deserving as any of the entrepreneurial characters for whom Conservative Members seem to reserve all their sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employees of BNOC have served well. Lord Croham paid tribute to them in the 1984 annual report. He devoted a substantial part of his short statement to that tribute to the people in his organisation. He ended his statement with the words:
	<br><q><p>"Most of those staff will have moved on before the next and last Report of this Corporation appears and I would therefore like to extend to them my gratitude for their services and my best wishes for their future."</p></q>
Lord Croham may have said that as an individual, but he said it also as a representative of the state. In expressing his gratitude for the services of the employees and offering his best wishes for their future, he spoke on his behalf and on our behalf. The Secretary of State has not repudiated his felicitations, nor has the Minister of State. I am sure that he would be happy to endorse Lord Croham's remarks, and he may well already have done so, either directly or by implication. So he has a moral obligation to listen sympathetically to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend said is reasonable, and the demonstration of sensitivity that the Minister's acceptance or consideration would provide is something which the Government desperately need to effect. Their standing is diminishing daily, and is now very low. If they were to show at least a drop of the milk of human kindness, it might be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know whether the Government will show such sensitivity. We can only say, as my hon. Friend has said, that although the employees are relatively few, they deserve consideration in view of their service over the past two years. I trust that the Minister will not continue to sit unmoved and unmoving, and that his response to the amendment will not be as cold and harsh as he has been so far. I am sorry that no Conservative Member has said a single word, but I hope that the Minister will be able to redeem his party with an acceptable response to what my hon. Friend has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Mick Buchanan-Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me start by assuring the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) that there is no question of our reneging on what was said earlier. The position was made clear on Second Reading and would have been equally clear to any fair-minded person reading the record. But, if any confusion remains, it was surely
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
dispelled by what 1 said to the hon. Gentleman during our sittings motion debate at the start of the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me also assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that we have borne in mind the interests of staff in all the discussions and studies on the future of the Government pipeline and storage system. One of our reasons for deciding not to privatise the system, following the initial consultants' report, was our wish to maintain some continuity. We shall discuss that further when we reach clause 2. I cannot, of course, commit future Governments, but we would not have transferred this function to the agency unless we believed that that continuity could be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the agency agreement between the Government and BNOC. The original agreement expired at the end of March 1984, and is now being renewed annually. But it is a formal contract and does not rest on a simple exchange of letters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me see whether I have grasped what the Minister has said. Until the end of March 1984 there was a proper, permanent, cono tractual relationship between BNOC and the Department of Energy. At the end of March, that contract was formally terminated, and since then it has been renewed on a 12-month basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us whether the Depart. meat intends to renew the original longer-term contractual relationship? That might be helpful for the future stability of the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No decision can yet be made about the length of particular agreements, but I shall examine the matter and, if possible, clarify it in a later debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I understand the concern of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, the Committee and BNOC's staff, and I regret any confusion over the terms of compensation. I am not trying to duck responsibilities, but I think we should be clear about where the contractual and legal obligations lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made clear in the House on 1 April, it is the responsibility of BNOC's management to make arrangements about redundancies. However, it is the principle that matters, and I think—despite all that has been said by the hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Wentworth—that that principle is perfectly clear to any reasonable and fair-minded person. Compensation should be offered only to those who are made redundant, or to whom continued employment would be available only if they were prepared to accept such a reduction in job content that it could be said that they had lost their jobs. It would be wrong to offer redundancy payments to staff as an alternative to a firm offer of continued employment in the same job; such offers would, moreover, be unfair to BNOC staff for whom continued employment in the same job was not available. I have no reason to believe that the corporation has not acted on that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked what would happen to those who had transferred to othe agency with additional responsibilities. I think it would be reasonable for the agency to enhance their terms and conditions of employment, but I am now talking about staff who are transferred to the agency to do the same job. They will, of course, receive the same terms and conditions as before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister is trying to be helpful, but he has said nothing about those whose career prospects are frozen. Even if they are transferring to do the same job for a similar salary, the prospects that they had a year ago will be sadly diminished. Surely that should be reflected in the arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's question, but no Government or employer can ever identify career prospects precisely. I am not aware that they are generally written into a person's terms of contract, but if specific commitments were made in a contract of employment given to BNOC staff, of course there would be obligations to honour them. The hon. Gentleman is asking for rather more than what is normal practice in the private or the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State said on Second Reading that what we are doing does not force people into the agency. If staff do not wish to be employed by the agency they have the option of resigning and it would be rather absurd to pay for them to exercise that option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the first time that a pipeline agency: has transferred one body to another. Originally, the pipeline and storage system was run by the Department of Energy and its predecessors. The officials did not volunteer, nor did they accept BNOC' as their employer. When they were transferred from the Department of Energy to the corporation by the Labour Government, of which the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was a member, I do not recall that they were offered the alternative of redundancy compensation at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wentworth appeals to me to show a few drops of the milk of human kindness. If I lack that milk of human kindness, so did the Government whom he supported. We are dealing with staff who are transferring to the same jobs and will have the same conditions of service in the agency. What is proposed is not unreasonable and I have no reason to believe that the corporation is acting any differently from the Department of Energy when a Labour Government were in office. That is why the Committee should reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not consider the Minister's reply to be an adequate response to a fairly put case. I have noted some of his remarks and I hope that I shall paraphrase them correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the contractual relationship. The fact that we are not aware of what that relationship will be between the agency and the Depart
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
ment of Energy is a matter of considerable concern, as it adds to the uncertainy. I had assumed that there would be a permanent contractual relationship. We shall take the opportunity to deal with that on clause 2 when we hope that the relationship between the agency and the Department of Energy will be clearly specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister read carefully the statement on compensation. I believe that he said that if the job content declines or it can be proved that it has diminished there would be compensation. But job content also includes career prospects. If one knows that one's job will be enhanced, or will offer the opportunity to go higher in the organisation or to move to other aspects of the corporation's activities—perhaps on the oil trading side—that makes a difference. Staff have been employed as members of a national oil corporation and not of the pipelines division. The Minister did not answer those important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that in his carefully worded statement that there would be compensation if the job content were diminished, such job content also embraced career prospects? I should like the Minister to clarify that question before we leave the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) went to a lot of trouble to describe the calibre of staff that we are discussing. Does it not follow that if they are of such high calibre they will have little difficulty getting positions elsewhere, either in the oil business or outside in private industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. The staff may get other positions but that is not our argument. In being transferred, staff should obtain certain rights because the Minister's official policy decisions lie outside their control. The Minister must accept some responsibility for the consequences of those decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation's staff may be able to find jobs outside, but I do not know which world the hon. Gentleman lives in. Unemployment and redundancy do not hit only unskilled workers today. Thatcherite economics have displaced many successful managerial workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is wandering far beyond the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>:Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Knox, I was responding—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair has ruled that the hon. Gentleman is wandering and he has no right to dispute that ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of disputing your ruling, Mr. Knox. In response to the intervention of the hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) I was pointing out that job content should involve career prospects. The hon. Gentleman intervened to say that surely the division's staff had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
good prospects outside and I observed that at managerial levels throughout industry and business some very successful people have genuinely fallen victim. I presume that it was my mention of Thatcherite economics that caused you, Mr. Knox, to jump up and down, and I appreciate your concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must appreciate that I had no personal concern in what he was saying but he was out of order when he started to introduce a general economic debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of doing so and I am glad that you, Mr. Knox, prevented me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second point was that it would be unfair to others being displaced if those in the category that I described received the same terms and conditions. We should ask whether other members of staff are complaining or whether they feel any unfairness. I have detected no trace of other members of staff jibbing at the notion that safeguards for their colleagues facing such changes would create unfairness. If the Minister has such evidence, let him produce it. We have no evidence that the staff would react in that way. That was a wholly bogus point to introduce at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Minister said, " Ah, this happened before under the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975, when powers were transferred from the Department of Energy to BNOC ". I was not a Minister in that Department but I cannot recall any ripple of dissent. I should be grateful if the Minister could produce concrete evidence that in 1975 staff were dragooned into BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that people were happy to accept the opportunities offered in the marvellous, vibrant and successful BNOC set up by the Labour Government. They were happy to be employed in what was, until this lot got their hands on it, a successful and enterprising national oil corporation. If the Minister has evidence that the Labour Government dragooned people into BNOC from the Department of Energy in 1975, I will accept my share of the collective blame, although I think it will be fairly minimal. I was employed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Welsh Office at the time. However, I have never shirked the prospect of collective responsibility, so I would accept the blame and state that a future Labour Government will do much better in this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely we should consider the content of work being offered in the new job as opposed to that being offered currently. Is it not likely to be in people's interests to go into a bigger organisation with better job prospects than to remain where they are? Yet the BNOC staff will be going to a smaller organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) has made a basic and simple point, which was totally ignored by the Minister. We should compare the conditions for the transfer of staff. Obviously I have not done sufficient homework to find out whether there were people who felt aggrieved by the original transfer,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
but if the Minister is correct I should accept some responsibility and say that progress is about learning from one's experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as my hon. Friend rightly points out, the comparison is not valid. We are talking about a transfer of staff from a larger corporation, with a larger range of functions, duties and career pros-. pects, to a much smaller, shrunken organisation. The Minister boasted about that on Second Reading, though I shall not weary the Committee by digging out my Hansard report of the second sitting of the Committee when he talked about the slimmed down, limited role of the agency. We are not comparing like with like. That is one of his specious and spurious arguments in support of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister has not responded to our points—for example he did not say whether the terms of the Bliss judgment which I quoted might have a bearing—I make one final appeal. Will he sit down and talk to the staff, and understand and appreciate their views. Although he said that the corporation would do the negotiating and sort out the nitty gritty, in spirit, principle and fairness he owes it to the staff to discuss the issue with them to see whether an amicable arrangement can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of assurances from the Minister, I am tempted to ask my hon Friend to support me on this issue and to seek to include the amendment in the Bill. I hope that all hon. Members consider the argument and join me in doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhmney (Mr. Rowlands) has made several specific points. Holding discussions with the staff is the responsibility of the corporation. The principles involved are what matter for the Government. I have no doubt that the corporation has acted in accordance with those principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about career prospects. They are not normally considered. They go with the content of the job, and will not be taken into account. The hon. Gentleman is straining his argument a little. He says that people moved from the Civil Service to BNOC, with greater career prospects and so on, but that now they will move from a larger organisation to a smaller one and will lose those prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have though that the Civil Service was a slightly larger organisation than BNOC. According to the hon. Gentleman, one simply legislates in accordance with the number of complaints one receives. One therefore legislates in accordance with the discontent rather than in accordance with principles—those of fairness and correctness as I des cribed earlier—which is what I have sought to do. If the hon. Gentleman pushes the amendment to a vote I must recommend my hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting concept that fairness or unfairness is not related to the number of complaints received about the system. I should have thought that the whole basis of parliamentary

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
representation and constituency representation is based exactly on that principle. Many a good piece of legislation and many decisions of Governments have been amended or changed as a result of complaints. It is one of the best sources of amending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's argument seems to defy our presence here as hon. Members representing constituencies: through the complaints that we receive from our constituents we see how general policy affects the individual. It is not an argument against principles. The Minister's argument is an extremely curious one for a Member of Parliament to advance. Had the Minister promised to meet the staff I should have withdrawn the amendment. However, in view of his unwillingness to meet even the most minimal request, I ask my hon. Friends to vote on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had anticipated that these slight amendments would not take more than a moment or two to consider. However, in view of that demonstration by the Minister of the historic weaknesses of Governments after they have been in office for a few years and have developed instant sensitivity, the temptation to have a long debate on the amendments is very strong. But I shall resist the temptation because I am anxious to reach amendment No. 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the amendments have been selected together. If they had been selected separately some difficulty would have arisen if, albeit a slight possibility, the Government had found one of them acceptable. Taken together, they have an attraction which may appeal to one or two Conservative Members. One of them maintains the Government's approach to the Bill which is to keep as much superfluous content as possible while the other seeks to assist by removing some words. Together they present no great difficulty but they also present a rather attractive paradox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the debate the Minister seems to have wanted to retain everything in the Bill even though we have been able to demonstrate clearly that some parts of the Bill are utterly unnecessary. I do not expect that he will have changed his approach and therefore amendment No. 22 will not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
be acceptable. However, as the Minister is attached to superfluity at all costs, he may accept amendment No. 21 because it inserts words which he may consider unnecessary. But as he has frequently requested that words should remain, to add flexibility or underline meaning amendment No. 21 may appeal to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not be greatly distressed if the Minister does not find the amendment especially appealing. However, when we considered the question of superfluity at the start of the debate, it would have helped if he had taken a sympathetic view to our approaches. Unfortunately, the docile and regimented nature of Conservative Members suggests that appeals to logic, economy of language or literary merit will carry no weight, so I do not see the point of pressing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 appeals to me for a number of reasons. You will tell me if I am out of order, Mr. Knox, in expressing my concern about the quorum. Let me illustrate it with a recent experience which may lend further justification to amendment No. 23, which 1 consider the most important of the three amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am vice-chairman of a committee of the Western European Union. Like one or two other British members of that committee, I have become rather irritated by the propensity of those in power to call meetings in Paris on Friday afternoons—or, failing that, on Monday mornings—which necessitate my getting up in Yorkshire at 3 o'clock in the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the chairman called a meeting on a Friday afternoon, I pointed out that he would be unable to maintain an adequate attendance throughout the meeting and that British committee members, both Conservative and Labour, found it unpleasant that meetings were called for such times. I suggested that they were called for such times so that committee members could spend weekends in Paris instead of getting on with their business. I was viewed with some hostility by a number of my committee colleagues who did not like that sort of remark, but I do not like getting up at 3 am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
Having refused to attend the meeting, I studied the minutes carefully when they were produced. I noted that 17 members had attended the meeting, which was therefore quorate. However, members have a practice of depositing their votes and then leaving the meeting. I assessed the situation carefully and discovered that, when the votes were taken, only five of my continental colleagues were present. The remaining 12 had registered their attendance at the meeting and then departed, leaving their votes with the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether such a practice will be allowed under the new agency's arrangements. It means that a tiny number of committee members make decisions, having persuaded their colleagues to leave their votes with them before those colleagues swanned off. At the next meeting, I made a number of provocative and heartfelt comments about the arrangement. I am therefore particularly sensitive at present to the question of quorums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. T. H. H. SKEET 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>The amendment is not unreasonable. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would find it attractive if they were able to exercise their roles as Members of Parliament fair-mindedly. I understand the limitations of the present political system; we are obliged to our parties and are expected to have regard to our parties' policies, management and Whips. However, even with the discipline imposed by their party, Conservative Members should not find the amendment unreasonable and 1 do not think the Committee need divide on party lines.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stefan Terlezki</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Cardiff, West): I find the amendment strange. The hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) related his experience of a chairman's using his prerogative in collecting votes and so on. Whether that is right or wrong is a matter of opinion. However, every organisation—all committees, boards, industrial boards, local authorities—has a chairman. It is no good to appoint a chairman and not to give him the necessary power to call a meeting of the body when he feels it appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to see how we can have the Secretary of State doing the job for which a chairman has been appointed. The chairman is the master and the captain of the ship; he sails the ship accordingly and so he conducts the affairs of the committee of which he is appointed chairman, accordingly. The amendment is irrelevant and inconsistent with the rules and regulations for the activities of the chairman of a committee, agency, company or whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that we should change—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terlezki</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for correcting me, Mr. Skeet. As a new Member of Parliament, I daresay that I have a lot to learn. I accept your correction, but I adhere to what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) is entitled to consistency. He told us at the end of his short intervention that he is adhering to his point. He went on for so long that I forgot what he said at the beginning of his intervention. It comes back to me: he said that the chairman of the agency should have power, and I go along with him. Sometimes chairmen of commitees have power, and abuse it, and sometimes they have power and use it wisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West is nodding his head in agreement. Sometimes, not frequently, chairmen have power which is abused. Yesterday I heard the chairman of the National Coal Board make a speech which annoyed me greatly. I think that I could make that speech relevant to the amendment, Mr. Skeet, but I shall wait while I make sure that my remarks are relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my ilustration, the chairman of the committee insisted on calling meetings at times and on dates which were inconvenient to members of the committee including his vice-chairman. We are of different party political persuasions, and as I do not approve of the chairman's actions I am making myself awkward in that committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not like to see the same thing happening in Britain. I like to think that such a practice would never occur here, and the mechanisms in the amendment are worth considering, to ensure that it never does. Without being disloyal to the British delegation to the Western European Union I have made more intense and bitter objections to the awful meeting dates than the Conservative Members of the committee have done. The hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant), who was until recently a member of the committee, might like to note that. I think that Conservative Members would like to object, but they are rather more restrained than I am. It may be because they live in London, or the south of England, and so not have to get up as early as I do. However, the abuse is there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the chairman of the agency decides that he does not like one of its members—there will be only three or four people, so it will not be difficult for that to happen—or if he wants to steamroller his way through, without opposition--there have been, and may be, chairmen of public sector companies who like to do that—it is easy for him to fix a low quorum. With a small number of people, the chairman can exercise a dictatorial power that is likely to lead to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of a public sector company or corporation should be recognised as the leader both outside and inside the organisation. He must be seen as possessing the attributes relevant to leadership. Such attributes do not depend on mechanical contrivance; they depend on human qualities, rather than on manipulation and intrigue. The sooner chairmen of public sector organisations realise that leadership does not depend on a capacity to intrigue and operate within an area of mechanical contrivance, the better.

is a remarkably well established figure. He is widely recognised and respected in the community and in the industry. He would not care two hoots who devised the number of the quorum, because he would not rely on it. But the present chairman of the National Coal Board would bitterly resent any attempt to interfere with his influence on determining the quorum of his board because, as he was when he was chairman of the British Steel Corporation, he is determined to exercise a stranglehold on the composition of the board. Indeed, he probably had a hand in determining the arrangements for the quorum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr David Knox 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I had a constituent who was proposed as a member of the board of the British Steel Corporation. The chairman said that he would not have him, although the man had been selected by is union and his union had the constitutional right to put forward a nomination. Mr. MacGregor, the chairman, said that he did not want that man on his board. I wrote to Mr. MacGregor and asked him why, because the man is a responsible and reputable person. He replied that he had nothing against the man. There was no personal reason at all. If the chairman of a public body can behave like that, and be so determined to exercise power over the board that he chairs, there is not merely the possibility of abuse but the probability of abuse.</p>
	<p>So even though Ministers may feel that their nominees to these positions are commendable, and those nominees may enjoy the support of both sides of the House, we can never be absolutely sure. Where the national interest is involved, there should be the minimum of interference, but some interference, and one way to ensure that is to make the size of the board adequate to secure broad consideration, and insist on a quorum which allows effective operation.</p>
	<p>I have tabled the amendment because I do not believe that the agency should determine the quorum; the Secretary of State should make that decision. However, it seems to be the general practice in this Committee for the Minister to resist every logical and sensible argument of the Opposition, so I am not optimistic that he will accept the amendment.</p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>I want a guarantee—my hon. Friends would be justified in insisting on that guarantee—that we shall be told what quorum the new agency will have. If, for example, the chairman wants a quorum that will concentrate in his hands the power of consideration and decision-making, will the Secretary of State, although he may not wish to interevene constitutionally, be prepared to express an opinion to the agency and seek to influence its arrangements? We are entitled to ensure that the quorum is not pitched at such a level that the chairman can call meetings at absurd and unholy hours, on inappro
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
priate days or in a way that might be unacceptable to the people serving on the agency and detrimental to the work of the agency and the national interest.</p>
	<p>That is why I tabled amendment No. 23, with which we are taking amendments Nos. 24 and 25. It would be discourteous of me not to present some arguments in favour of amendments Nos. 24 and 25, although they are not as important as amendment No. 23. The justifiable intervention of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West shows that even Conservative Members recognise that amendment No. 23 is the most important of the three.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 24 talks about "a defect". I trail that amendment because the Government have the unfortunate characteristic that, like all intolerant political organisations, they cling to the belief that they are infallible. I do not believe that any man or any human organisation is infallible, so I decided to tease Conservative Members by giving them the opportunity in amendment No. 24 to demonstrate their belief in their own infallibility by taking out the word " defect ", removing the acceptance that there could be a defect in the Government. I do not imagine that Conservative Members will support the amendment: if they do, they will emphasise their belief in their infallibility; if they do not, they will accept that they may be defective and therefore accept our view that the Government are fallible. It is a small debating point, but one that is worth making from time to time, in view of the 4 million people who are unemployed. However, Mr. Knox, you would rule me out of order were I to pursue that subject at length. Many of us feel that the words should properly remain, but I felt that Conservative Members should have the opportunity to demonstrate their own political foible.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 25 proposes to leave out paragraph 6:
	<br><q><p>"The validity of any proceedings of the Agency shall not be affected by any vacancy among the members or by any defect in the appointment of a member."</p></q></p>
	<p>It proposes to take out the whole paragraph, whereas amendment No. 24 would take out only part of it. However, amendment No. 25 has merit. I am not sure that we can accept the validity of the proceedings of the agency if the Minister is determined, as it would appear, to have a very small agency. If it is to be as small as we suspect, any vacancy should not be allowed to persist. Given the fact that the agency will be small, the Minister could reassure the Committee by telling us that he will take steps to ensure that no vacancy exists for more than a few weeks.</p>
	<p>Experience leads me to believe that the Committee is entitled to ask the Minister to ensure first, that no quorum rules are imposed or established that are harmful or allow abuse to creep in, or allow the chairman excessive power. Secondly, quorum rules should not Ie such as to place any individual member of the agency in difficulty. Thirdly, if the agency is small and a vacancy occurs, it should be filled promptly, as delay will contribute to the potential for abuse by those remaining. Finally, I should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
like the Minister's comments on the need for Ministers to confess any defects in the appointment of a member.</p>
	<p>I referred to my experience when Mr. MacGregor refused to accept one of my constituents, who was an eminent member of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and whose great ability was frequently recognised by his employers, the British Steel Corporation. As I can foresee problems where there is a defect in not appointing a member, I shall not press amendment No. 24 with great vigour. However, it is interesting to note that even the present Government have to accept that defects are possible. That is a refreshing change.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will consider my remarks seriously because they are relevant. I see no reason why the Secretary of State should not determine the quorum. Indeed, many sensible and responsible chairmen of public corporations would not bat an eyelid if the Secretary of State decided that, in the interests of building a proper arrangement protective of the national interest, he should determine what the quorum should be. If the Secretary of State does not want to make that decision, the chairman of the agency, or of any other public sector organisation, should be prepared to discuss the matter.</p>
	<p>Is the Secretary of State or the Minister prepared to consult the chairman of the pipelines agency about the quorum? If the chairman of the agency asks the Department of Energy for its idea about the quorum the Secretary of State or his officials will have to say, " It's up to you." If the chairman of the agency wants to suggest that two, three or four members should form the quorum, the Minister should not rule out his capacity to respond. It seems perfectly reasonable for the chairman to consult the Department and perfectly reasonable for the Department to give advice. It would be better constitutionally if the Secretary of State decided what the quorum should be.</p>
	<p>I watched the Minister while the hon. Member for Cardiff, West was intervening, but he did not show a flicker of sympathy then or when I made my short comments. Perhaps the Minister misunderstood his hon. Friend's words. I said that the hon. Gentleman's intervention was rather long and that I did not understand the point—</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that you, Mr. Knox, were out of the Room when the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) intervened. I do not mean to be rude to the hon. Gentleman, but his intervention was of astonishing length, one of the longest that I can recall. Half way through the hon. Gentleman's intervention I forgot that it was an intervention and started to work out which member of the Committee would speak next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West was long, but I am not sure whether it was helpful. I got the impression that the hon. Gentleman could see merit in my amendment but not sufficient merit to justify his taking a view different from that of his hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant), who is in charge of discipline. Fortunately the hon. Member for Reading, West has gone, so the hon. Member for Cardiff, West can let his hair down for a moment. If he wishes to explain the point he made in his long intervention, I shall gladly give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terlezki</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be so lucky.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, in that case I could not understand the hon. Gentleman's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be helpful when he replies. He may have followed the intervention of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West and wish to accommodate his hon. Friend's view. I hope that the Minister will recognise that our amendments have some merit. Even if the Minister will not go all the way along the very small step required by the amendments, especially by amendment No. 23, I hope that he will assure us that the public interest will be safeguarded and that we shall not have to rely upon a bureaucratic mechanism open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that when the Minister replies, the hon. Member for Cardiff, West will be satisfied. We should prefer to be satisfied by the Minister's response. I hope that that response will be forthcoming—if not now, in what I hope will be a relatively short debate on schedule 1 stand part. The amendments are the last batch on schedule 1, and I do not wish to rush the Minister into any consideration. A reply on the schedule stand part debate would allow the Minister more time for thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen with interest to the Minister's response. I deeply regret that he has been put in difficulty. I could not understand fully the intervention of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West, and

the Minister may have lost the principal merit of his hon. Friend's intervention. I am sad that the hon. Member for Cardiff, West will not clarify his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members seem unwilling to question for even one moment the detailed and complex minutiae of the Bill, so I can only sit down and wait for what I hope will be an intelligent response from the Minister of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) on, first, amendment No. 23. Ministers and Conservative Members of the Committee were adamant in refusing to amend clause 1. The agency is to have a full or part-time chairman, and no fewer than two and no more than four other members. Therefore a quorum will involve a very small number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the chairman decides that 50 per cent. of members will constitute a quorum in the case of the lower figure it will mean that two people only will be taking decisions on behalf of the agency. The Minister must tell us, if not this morning at some later stage, that it is unacceptable that two members only could make decisions on the business of the agency. The Minister must either accept amendment No. 23 or bring forward some provision in its place to allow more ministerial control of the agency. He cannot say, " We are getting rid of BNOC. The new agency will be all right. It will be losing all its functions except for handling some oil in kind, and so on."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister be satisfied that two people only should be handling the oil in kind being dealt with by the agency and that they should also take the major decisions on oil supplies that the House was promised would rest with the agency in times of national emergency? If two—or three—people could take such decisions, the Secretary of State ought to have the power to decide on increasing the quorum. As clause 1 has not been amended, I do not see how we could avoid that situation arising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 seeks to delete from the Schedule the words
	<br><q><p>"or by any defect in the appointment of a member."</p></q>
It is incredible that the Government should be adamant over appointing, at the most, five members of the board under clause 1, and at the same time admit in paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 that there might be defects in the appointments of members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do those words mean? Surely a Secretary of State should have a reasonable grasp of the task of making five appointments to an agency in the certain knowledge that there was no defect in any of his appointments. I should like some further explanation of the rider contained in the schedule. What type of defect in the appointment of any member do the Government envisage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, on the higher figure, all five members might not be appointed at any one time, but surely in such a case the Secretary of State should have some power over what constitutes a quorum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
The ridiculous situation could arise when there was. more than one vacancy in the agency, and that would mean a struggle to achieve a quorum if the lower figure had been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth, I should like the Minister to explain the quorum, and also what is meant by the words in paragraph 6,
	<br><q><p>"any defect in the appointment of a member."</p></q>
Amendment No. 25 would remove all paragraph 6.. If the phrase is to be taken out by amendment No. 24, perhaps the whole paragraph should be removed. I await the Minister's reply on the quorum and the appointment of members. Obviously paragraph 6 has been included because the Minister thinks that there may be some problems with the appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) that I shall not be rushed. His example might tempt me not to rush, though the kind of rushing that I might do would be different from that which he seeks to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I shall be intelligent in my reply. I approach all Opposition amendments in as constructive a way as possible. When I considered amendment No. 25, which proposes to remove paragraph 6, I saw that it followed the precedent of paragraph 7 of schedule 1 of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975, passed by the previous Labour Government. I was tempted to remove it, as it was a provision which the previous Labour Government had decided to include. I thought that perhaps at last I had found an Opposition amendment which I could accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I was not rushed. I reflected and spent the evening hours reading back over our debates and the anxieties of Opposition Members that we should give the agency freedom to act, that it should not be the servant of the Secretary of State or governed by the officials of the Department of Energy, and that it should be given freedom. On amendment No. 23, I am more swayed by the arguments of hon. Members in previous debates than by this set of amendments. I am certain that my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) thought that we should give the agency a reasonable amount of freedom, without having the Secretary of State or the Department of Energy breathing down its neck. We should allow the agency to decide how to conduct its affairs, on matters such as the quorum and how meetings are held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the anxiety about the quorum. Obviously it is a small body, though not as low as two, as the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) said. It consists of the chairman plus a minimum of two others. Therefore, the range could be three to five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my experience 50 per cent. of those appointed would be a quorum. If we take the bottom number in clause 1, there would be two appointees plus the chairman, so 50 per cent. of the two appointees would be one. Two appointees would be needed to make the decision. If there are to be at least two, there would be a 100 per cent. turnout which would constitute a quorum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that further clarification of his thoughts, but I nevertheless feel that we should leave it to the agency to decide how its affairs should be run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about technical defects. The words are hallowed by precedent, and although that does not necessarily mean that they should be slavishly followed, we should be prepared for the possibility of a technical defect in the instrument of appointment, for instance. I hope, however, that that will not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for an undertaking that any vacancies on the agency would be filled expeditiously. The Secretary of State is only obliged to ensure a minimum of three members. However, if a vacancy arises and it is felt that it should be filled, I have no doubt that the present Secretary of State or one of his successors will move to fill it, while remaining within the brackets laid down in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Rother Valley will no doubt be the first to recognise, there is a safeguard. If the chairman and members of the agency behaved in an obviously irresponsible and unreasonable way, they could be removed in certain circumstances. In other circumstances, the Secretary of State could make a direction to the agency with which it would have to comply. However, we are talking about an extreme case in which extreme measures would have to be taken. Meanwhile, we should try to maintain the agency's freedom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which part of the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power of general direction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in clause 5(1)(a). I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has not managed to read his Bill as quickly as I have, but perhaps my ears are more alert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is a fine balance of judgment here, but I come down firmly on the side of giving the agency discretion, in the knowledge that the Secretary of State has powers which he can exercise in the event of unreasonable behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One again we are getting nowhere, despite the pleasantness of the Minister's delivery, and I feel that we are entitled to press him on one or two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hon. Members will have been members of organisations where the quorum was one third. My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) mentioned 50 per cent., but that merely illustrates the seriousness with which those in the Labour movement take their responsibilities. In the City and in business organisations, a quorum of one third is very common, and it is probably used by most executive committees of Conservative constituency associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the number of agency members is to be three, one third will mean one member. The chairman could decide that he was holding a meeting of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
agency during his tea break. Incidentally, although clause 5(1)	<i>(a)</i> provides for the powers of the Secretary of State, we have not yet discovered who will pay for the tea. But I shall not press that matter at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, according to all the precedents, there could be a quorum of one. If the chairman decides that there should be a quorum of one, we shall be entitled to ask the Secretary of State to intervene. Furthermore if the chairman tells the Department of Energy that he has a mind to have a quorum of one because there are only three members on the agency, the Department officials should tell him that, although it was said in Committee that he should have such power, he should reconsider that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not a quorum of one used at Cabinet meetings at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is possibly an unwritten arrangement. In this context we are talking about a more formalised structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister keeps the membership at three, and if logic and precendents are pursued, the quorum could well be one. The Minister would accept that a quorum of one is simply not on. Even though the chairman is being trusted to get on with his job it is still impossible for anyone to have a quorum of one. Therefore, I ask the Minister to ensure that if the chairman proposes to have a quorum of one, and there are only three on the agency, the Secretary of State will exercise his power or informal representations will be made. Certainly there must be some response from the Department of Energy in such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can at least avoid one of the risks if the Secretary of State will agree that should the quorum be one third, there will have to be an additional member of the agency. If he will assure the Committee that there will be four and that the quorum will not be less than one third, the chairman would never be able to hold a meeting during his tea break. That is a reasonable request which I hope Conservative Members will endorse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only other point is that if the agency still comprises only three members, two of them being the chief executive and the chairman, the third person might feel vulnerable. If there is a quorum of two, the third person may feel rather ill at ease and uncomfortable. As people on public sector boards are not often recognised—they are often vilified by some of the more extreme Conservative Members for having some regard for the public sector's needs—that position would be best avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of good relationships, as well as making sure that the quorum is effective, if the Minister will not accept our amendment will he at least accept our suggestion that an additional appointment is necessary to prevent an absurd situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my wildest imagination, when I tabled the amendment with my hon.

Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) described clause 2 as the nub of the Bill, and I feel a sense of relief as we approach this central part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first heard the Government's announcement about their proposal to abolish BNOC, it did not occur to me that the Bill effecting that abolition would be called the Oil and Pipelines Bill. At that time, I did not think of the pipelines as an important part of the corporation's activities. I mention that because it illustrates the point that the land pipelines and storage system has been a forgotten corner of the BNOC empire on which hon. Members—although I have not been a Member of the House for long myself—have not often focused their attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
The land pipelines and storage system is to some extent shrouded in mystery, so my first purpose in proposing the amendment is to give the Minister of State an opportunity to say a little more about the land pipelines and storage system—how it operates and what it consists of. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney tried to discover earlier the nature of the arrangements and suggested that the Minister might wish to deal with that while we were discussing this amendment.

If the Government are proposing that the agency should run the land pipelines and storage system, I feel that my right hon. Friend should explain why the agency should run it, the structure and importance of the system and the justification for its continuance under the agency's management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system appears to consist of hundreds of miles of high-quality pipeline, mainly located in east Anglia and the midlands and useful for the transport of oil products. However, I found it difficult to discover more precise information about the system beyond those basic facts. Clearly, it has an important role in supplying defence establishments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I recommend the excellent lecture presented by Mr. A. L. Adams of BNOC at the Post House, Leicester on Thursday 8 March 1980? Of course, it is a few years out of date, but it is a marvellous account of the evolution and development of the pipeline system and could almost constitute a basic explanatory document for the Committee. I should be happy to provide a photocopy of the lecture for the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has spoken with his customary generosity and has done a great service to the Committee in drawing its attention to that document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the hon. Gentleman can explain the pipeline system in greater detail, but, from the information that I have gleaned, it has an important defence implication; indeed, the original purpose of the system was to supply airfields in east Anglia. However, the system does not simply have a public sector use; it is heavily utilised by the commercial sector. Clearly, I do not intend to press my right hon. Friend on matters that are confidential, but it stands to reason that the defence demand on the system must be much less than total. The defence establishments cannot require the full capacity of the pipeline system, certainly in peacetime. I hazard a guess that the peacetime demand by defence establishments will be less than half, although, naturally, in the event of hostilities breaking out, there would be an increased demand for the use of these facilities. I shall come to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the use of the system by the private sector is not an incidental matter. It is not something that happens from time to time or on the margins. It is fundamental to the functioning of the pipeline system. We are dealing with a valuable public sector asset which, in normal times, is used mainly by the private sector. I hope that my right hon. Friend will confirm that what I have said is correct. It brings home to us our duty as parliamentarians to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
ensure that public sector assets are used and managed as effectively and efficiently as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the BNOC annual report and accounts for 1984, where I sought comfort and reassurance that this asset was being managed as well as possible. All that I gleaned from the report was the half-sentence that appears on page 9:
	<br><q><p>"Overall utilisation of the system has increased slightly over 1983, for both commercial and other usage".</p></q>
I am, of course, grateful to my right hon. Friend for providing the document, because in other respects it is most informative, but I find that sentence about as uninformative as it is possible to be. I hope that I shall not be considered over-cynical if I say that I infer two things from it: first, that utilisation in 1983 was almost certainly unsatisfactory, because otherwise here would be no allusion to improving the 1983 figure, and secondly, that even though there was an improvement in 1984, the word " slightly " is used, from which it can be gathered that there was a slight improvement in 1984 from an unsatisfactory situation in 1983. That does not give me the reassurance that I sought in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help feeling that if the overall utilisation of the pipeline system had been 98 per cent., that figures would have appeared in the annual report and accounts. The figure is probably less than that, so it was probably thought appropriate to enter no figures at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then asked myself, "Even if the performance to date in utilising the pipeline system and getting the most out of it for the taxpayer has not been as good as it might have been, what are the prospects for the future? " Again, I turned to the report and the end of the sentence that I quoted, which continues:
	<br><q><p>"and a number of proposals for handling additional volumes are under active review."</p></q>
I am not greatly encouraged by that. A "number of proposals" is an extremely vague phrase. Whenever I read the expression "under review" qualified by the adjective", I become even less sure that the organisation is being well managed. I do not wish to be unfair, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will correct me if I am doing anyone an injustice, in which case I shall withdraw my remarks immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began my remarks by saying that I thought that the pipeline system formed the forgotten corner of the BNOC empire. I meant that we, as par. liamentarians, had perhaps forgotten it. However, I am not sure that BNOC itself has not to some extent forgotten it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say anything that is unfair to BNOC employees. They may have done better than I think, but my impression is that the management of the pipeline system has not been given high priority. It is possible that the corporation has not gone out and made the large sums of money that it could have out of the commercial arrangements
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
for the pipelines. If it had done so, we should surely have heard about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first purpose of my amendment is to seek comments from my right hon. Friend. The second purpose has been to some extent foreseen by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. I want to know why this valuable asset, the pipelines system, remains in the public sector. Is there not a good argument for saying that, since the system is utilised more by the private than by the public sector, it ought to be privatised?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Opposition Members will have doubts, but there is nothing special about pipelines to require that they, of all assets, should be left in the public sector. Many pipelines are in the private sector now. Many oil products move round the country in pipelines that are privately owned. It will, of course, be said that the pipeline system of which we are talking is of strategic value. But most pipelines in this country are of strategic value, and one shudders to think what would happen if any were interrupted. However, many remain in the private sector, and their strategic value has not been considered a good argument for taking them into public ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Food distribution is vital to the survival of this country, yet there is no state presence in food distribution. Food distribution is more important than oil pipelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that very good point. But I am nervous when he puts forward such arguments, as he may be giving the Opposition ideas for a future manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to come closer to home and say that even though we have this important additional argument about the pipeline system supplying defence establishments, I take it—I can only guess—that many defence establishments are supplied by other means. I imagine that a number of establishments are supplied by rail and by road tankers. I have never heard it argued that for that reason road tankers should be brought into the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear distinction between the argument that the system is strategic and the argument, which I shy away from, that it should be kept in the public sector. I recognise that at a time of mounting tension, or during any hostilities involving this country, the armed forces would presumbaly wish to make greater use of the pipeline system than they do in peacetime. Even if that is so, I see no difficulty in making arrangements to allow the armed forces to take over an increasing proportion of the available supply system. Such arrangements could easily be made and would presumably not differ much from requisitioning arrangements made in time of war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The strategic importance of the pipeline was proved during the second world war. Also, if the pipeline is in the public sector, and is earning money that could be spent on the National Health Service, for example, where will we find

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
that money if an asset which is, I understand, now earning money for the public purse is sold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the. hon. Gentleman will not follow that path too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might answer the intervention briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is that in the public sector the asset is not being used as well as it could be. If it were sold to the private sector, it would bring a higher value than what we realise from it in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about an extremely valuable asset I do not have the figures here because the matter is to some extent shrouded in mystery, but it would have a high value. It should either be sold into the private sector, which would realise the value straightaway, or it should be managed in the public sector more commercially than it is now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Orkney and Shetland): The hon. Gentleman mentioned that the pipelines system was a valuable asset. Unfortunately, we do not and perhaps cannot know how much defence establishments use it, but they rely on it to some extent. It is proposed to hand that valuable asset to the private sector and to allow the private sector to charge defence establishments. If the asset is valuable, the private sector may charge a considerable price. Might it not add to the public borrowing requirement if public funds are used to pay for something that already lies within the public sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should very much hope that defence establishments pay for the service now and that BNOC charges them the same prices as other customers. That would apply pressure on defence establishments to cut their costs as much as they could. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) ought to be pleased to hear a Conservative Member say that. We are sometimes accused of not seeking value for money as actively as we should in the defence sector. The defence sector has incentive to seek value for money only if it is charged a commercial rate for the services provided for it, even if they are provided by a public sector body. One way or another, defence establishments ought to pay a commercial rate for using the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was gratified to hear the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney say that it was " perfectly reasonable " to investigate the option of putting the pipeline system into the private sector. I appreciate the spirit in which he said that. His remarks accord precisely with the objective of the amendment. It omits the words " pipelines and storage installations " to take them away from the competence of the agency and, one hopes, make it possible for the Government to follow up with legislation to put pipelines and storage installations into the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
It is possible that my right hon. Friend did not get out of bed on the privatising side this morning. If he feels that this is not the appropriate moment to accept the amendment, does he believe it possible to have the asset managed more commercially and effectively within the public sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our previous sitting, the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney called for the agency's management to be rewarded on a performance basis so that their pay and emoluments reflected their performance. That was a splendid principle although I did not agree with the details of his proposals. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Wentworth recognised in his hon. Friend a sort of closet Thatcherite and came down on him heavily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable today that Opposition Members, who until now have relied on a headmaster to keep order, have also had to bring in a Whip. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was straying too close to being right. He will be in some danger if he continues to have such thoughts. I should not like to put money on his future in the Labour party, but perhaps that is a small price to pay for being right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked my right hon. Friend whether the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was on to a good point. However, my right hon. Friend replied that it was very difficult to assess performance across the range of the agency's activities. However, the management of the pipeline system —that corner of the agency's activities—may not be susceptible to a performance determination. It is quite discrete from the rest of the agency's activities. It should be possible to see whether it is being managed in a commercial way and whether the profits are being pushed up year by year. So the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney may be on to a good point when he says that here is an area where the chairman and the board can be judged on their use of taxpayers' money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I know the Committee is anxious to make progress with the Bill, I shall not detain it further, but I want to make one more point, which I think will appeal to Opposition Members. The more that the private sector uses this under-utilised system and pushes oil products down pipelines, the less necessity there will be for road tankers bearing oil products to trundle around country lanes. That may appeal particularly to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace). An important environmental plus is hidden in my amendment, as I hope hon. Members will recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to accept amendment No. 36 as a prelude to the privatisation of the pipeline system. If they do not feel that the moment is appropriate, I ask them to keep that option open for future years. In particular, I ask my right hon. Friend to address himself to the efficiency with which the system is being managed and to the possibility of linking the management of the system to the emoluments that are payable to the chairman and the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Southgate (Mr. Portillo) about my "closet Thatcherite" thoughts and say that there is no greater opponent of Thatcherism than I. However, there may be some common ground between us because of the way in which the hon. Gentleman moved his amendment. We shall, therefore, expect his full support for our new clause 1. It suggests ways of developing the tremendous opportunity offered by this remarkable pipeline and storage system which can be enhanced and developed as part of the public sector. There may be some common ground there, but there is no common ground on privatisation. I said earlier that it was reasonable for the Government to look at that option within their own ideology, but that we did not share that ideology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pipeline system is the best possible combination of public enterprise and commercial potential. I have never thought such a view to be Thatcherite. If the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate wishes to come along with us, we shall find another term for it. The Opposition have always
