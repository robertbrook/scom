	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed </i>[4 June], No. 29, in page 6, line 9, to leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>`and shall, on ceasing to hold office, be eligible for reappointment'.—[	<i>Mr. Hardy.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expected that we would have finished our consideration of the amendment at our last sitting but that consideration lengthened when the Minister began his reply by saying that he did not need advice, as he was already familiar with the question, but went on to confess that he was not a member of the legal profession. We were left in some doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) intervened to say that the words under discussion should be included to give to the Bill the qualities of grace, consideration and sensitivity of the English language. I am sympathetic to his approach, but do not think that it is usual for law to be decided on literary merit. Were that so, we might find more rhymes and alliteration in the text of statutes but, unfortunately perhaps, we do not normally do SO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that the words should be retained simply to add a note of civility to the proceedings on this rather squalid little measure. Since the Minister has not yet convinced us of the need for the words he should reconsider the position, and if necessary, and on mature reflection, take further advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister does not wish to take advice, and feels that he is already well advised. The hon. Member for Cardiff, West made an important point: it would be nice to have the qualities he suggests enshrined in the statutes, but it is neither necessary nor usual. Since the words are superfluous, I suggest that the Minister accepts our argument and removes them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) was on his feet at the end of our last sitting—I hope that he has not been on his feet ever since—has given me the opportunity to reflect on his amendment, and to take advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the hon. Gentleman's appealing words, I am not persuaded of his argument. The choice lies between brevity and clarity. One could add to the brevity of the Bill by removing the words, without necessarily affecting the legal position—that has emerged from my consultations —but equally, for the reasons I gave, I believe that the words are helpful in the interests of clarity, and are necessary to make it clear that someone is eligible for reappointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
Despite all that the hon. Member for Wentworth has said, I hold to my position, and ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of Tuesday's sitting we asked what would be the usual term of office for the chairman and members of the board. Can the Minister now answer that question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I had intended to answer his question. Those who have been appointed so far been have offered initial terms of three years, starting at the date when the agency is established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 6, line 11, leave out
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>`except with the approval of the Treasury'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 16, in page 6, line 35, leave out sub-paragraph (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I approach the amendment without optimism, and with no spirit of ebullience after the sad and crushing response to the last amendment. The Minister appeared to be in no way co-operative or helpful, so I cannot hope that this amendment will attract his support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are grateful to the Minister for providing the information about the length of tenure of office. Will he confirm in his reply that the Department of Energy has had to consult the Treasury to be given permission to offer a term of office of three years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is desirable because the Treasury seems to have excessive and increasingly pervasive influence. If hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will seriously consider that point, they may arrive at the conclusion that I wish to put to the Committee: the influence of the Treasury is not invariably helpful, that its hand is sometimes clammy and perverse and other Departments ought to stand up for themselves more robustly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two Departments seem to have excessive influence under this Government. The Treasury is one. It is dominating and almost corrosive in its effect. The other is the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which apparently now has the right to appoint minders to serve on Committees whenever the House is considering legislation that has the slightest connection with agriculture. Those minders ensure that nothing is done or approved which could have a deleterious effect on the interests of that Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury's approach is more subtle. It makes sure that every possible reference is made to it in legislation. It ensures that all decisions that Committees try to make are qualified by the inclusion of words that allow the Treasury to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not good, either for the Treasury or for the Government. If Ministers feel that every little step that they may wish to take must be subject to the Treasury's approval, the point of absurdity will have been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have frequently said that they wish to reduce the size of the Civil Service. Their policy has brought despair, blighted careers, created fury and caused an increase in incompetence and difficulty. However, if the Government are to be consistent in their policy of reducing the size of the Civil Service, I suggest that the other Departments of state should enjoy a little more trust
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
and independence. If there were less toing and froing between the Treasury and Departments of state seeking permission for every tiny step, fewer civil servants could be appointed without harming the quality of the service. Indeed, if numbers were reduced in this area, that might allow the number of civil servants in other Departments where more useful things are done to be maintained, or even, perhaps, increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unacceptable that in Rotherham, where there has been an enormous increase in the number of unemployed, there has been no increase in the number of people employed by the Department of Employment to care for them. Indeed, the number of such employees has, in effect, been savagely cut. Yet there has been no reduction —as far as I can see—in the number of civil servants apponted to serve in the various Departments of state, whose job is to ensure that they are acting in a spirit of absolute docility in the face of the Treasury's imperialism —a strong word, perhaps, but possibly justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the job that we are discussing is not a huge or vital one. If it were, three-year, part-time appointments would not be acceptable. Even Conservative Members might question the part-time nature of the appointments. However, if the appointments are to be part-time and for only three years, surely it is not necessary for every appointment and every change—perhaps even every change in emolument — to be subjected to the searching scrutiny of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the Secretary of State and the Minister of State are experienced Ministers. They are not raw; they are not fools; they have some judgment; their colleagues, I imagine, trust their integrity and propriety. The Secretary of State for Energy — while he remains Secretary of State; the situation could change soon, but we must take things as they are—is a long-serving Cabinet Minister, so it is absurd for the Treasury to put into law the qualification that he must get its approval for every aspect of the appointments for which he is supposed to be responsible.
	<br><blockquote><p>"except with the approval of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
Those words are not necessary, because the Treasury's influence is all-pervasive. The chairman of BNOC, after all his years in the Civil Service and his eminence there, will have been imbued with the training that the whole system involves, and he may bequeath to the new agency a sensitivity to the existence of the Treasury. Given that sensitivity, it is not necessary for the Secretary of State and the Minister of State to be humbled by words in the Bill that make them appear mere ciphers, rubber stamps and office boys. The Department should be advised to take out those unnecessary and perhaps damaging, if not pernicious, words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 seeks to leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"The approval of the Treasury shall be required for any determination under this paragraph."</p></blockquote>
That will cover pensions, allowances and gratuities. For example, it may be decided that members are entitled to a free cup of tea. I do not know whether senior civil servants pay for their tea, but if the Minister decides that they can have a free cup of tea, that decision will have to go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That is ridiculous, but it is clearly inferred from subparagraph (5) which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any determination under this paragraph"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
has to be referred to the Treasury. Perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer is good at delegating, in which case the Minister of State, Treasury or the Financial Secretary to the Treasury may decide whether anyone serving in the agency shall have a free cup of tea. That prospect is less attractive to my hon. Friends and myself, because we feel that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is probably better equipped to make decisions about whether people should pay for their tea than about some of the matters that are currently being decided. I do not want to inject too partisan a note, so I will not pursue that line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that the approval of the Treasury for every tiny little thing that may be provided is absurd and should be removed. There is no option: the subparagrah says that the Treasury's approval "shall be required", not may be required. That does not allow the Treasury, if common sense dawns, to write to the Secretary of State for Energy saying, "We shall not need to be consulted if a free cup of tea is provided for the officers and servants of the agency." That is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a schoolmaster, I taught boys aged 12 and 13 for quite a long time. I would sometimes leave my classroom and let the boys make decisions, so that an element of democracy, self-government and independence was allowed in the school. Those boys had more of independence and self-government and a greater capacity to make decisions than Ministers in the Department of Energy have under the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's distrust of young people became apparent when I suggested that they should be prepared to appoint people under the age of 40 to the agency. The Minister of State thought that would be unwise, and he may think that I was unwise to give my 13-year-old boys some self-determination and independence. However, the Minister is not under 40, and I have faith in his ability to decide who shall have a free cup of tea. I have much more faith in his abilities than does the Treasury. But under the Bill, the Treasury will give the Minister no independence, which is rather sad. The Treasury is too powerful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that his 12-year-old school boys would ever have earned a headline such as the one in the 	<i>Financial Times which stated:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government blamed for BNOC loss"?</p></blockquote>
That loss amounted to about £86 million of public money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not follow that line of discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was tempted to do so, Mr. Knox, and no doubt we shall return to that matter when it is in order to discuss it. However, most of the boys whom I taught and who now live in my constituency appear to have developed a judgment, skill and understanding which would not lead them to approve the incompetent approaches or the political faith of the Government. Anyone in south Yorkshire who pursues such a faith is certifiable. I am not suggesting that Conservative Members are in that category, but we come from a different sort of area from that of most Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that every hon. Member accepts that there is no need to enshrine the dominance of the Treasury in legislation. The mandarins would move to question and probably reverse any decision made by the Department of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
Energy if that decision did not please the Treasury, even if it was already enshrined in a statute. But it is unacceptable to enshrine and extend that power in schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Civil Service is automatically bad and I am not suggesting that the Treasury is automatically incompetent, but the Treasury has a record of having made a considerable number of mistakes. When we find that at the end of the year the public sector borrowing requirement can be miscalculated by as much as £3 billion, it suggests that the Treasury should devote its attention to the larger things of life rather than to the smaller. The decisions that will be made under this part of schedule 1 cannot be classed as large matters. Those decisions are relatively small and therefore the Treasury should be allowed to delegate and allow the Minister of State, or the Secretary of State, to make them. I believe that that would be sensible and economic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to burden the Committee any more. Our few brief words this morning should have appealed to the common sense of Conservative Members who wish to effect economies in the public service and to see civility, prudence and decent qualities with our law. They would then accept that trust and co-operation must have a place in public life and there would be no need for the cloying, dead hand of Treasury intervention to be included in a matter that in many ways can be extremely slight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) approaches his amendment in such a mood of pessimism. I assure him that I look closely at the quality of his amendments. If it is high I give them constructive and careful consideration—in fact, I give them all constructive and careful consideration. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not continue in his mood of pessimism. When I respond positively it will show how much the quality has improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with such an amendment one feels that one has been here before. In all my time in the House of Commons — I am sure that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) Will agree— I have never served on a Committee on a Bill where, irrespective of which party was in Government and which in Opposition, the Opposition did not move such an amendment. It is a constant ploy—I shall not say game— for the Opposition to move such amendments but when they are in Government they defend the position they attacked in Opposition. I hope that I do not go on long enough for hon. Members to visit the Library and research my role on previous Bills. That might be dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wentworth asked about approval of the term of appointment of members of the board. The Bill provides that the Treasury is involved only in financial matters such as members' pay and pension provision. Treasury approval is not required for the length of the appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be precise. Paragraph 2(1) of schedule 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency may pay to any member such sums, whether by way of remuneration or allowances".</p></blockquote>
That provision justifies my comment about free cups of tea. It suggests that if the agency decides to give members a boot and shoe allowance or a car allowance the decision "shall"—not "may"—go the Treasury. It is not just pay and pensions that are involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is realistic. In response to the original question I distinguished between matters such as the length of appointment and financial matters. The hon. Gentleman is straining when he suggests that rulings on cups of tea must go the Treasury for approval. Any reasonable and sensible person will realise that the provision covers matters such as members' pay and pension provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always a chance of making precedents and of changing what has happened before, but the Bill follows previous Bills, which have not given rise to the kind of problems that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the fundamental issue behind the Bill, there is an analogy between Government control over public corporations and shareholders' control over private companies. The analogy is accurate because under company law, shareholders have to approve payments made by a company to its directors. The analogy here is that it is sensible that the Government and the Treasury should be involved in determining payments to members of public boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am opposed to the amendment, partly on the practical grounds that I mentioned, partly because there is ample precedent for this kind of arrangement — previous Labour Governments have enshrined it in legislation many times—and partly on principle, as I think that such control is sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making good progress and I hope that the positive spirit will continue. I have had a good breather since the first sitting. I have just been listening to the Minister's new doctrine for dealing with amendments. Apparently he judges the quality of our amendments by the positiveness of his response. I do not think that we can allow him to get away with that as a principle. Occasionally we have come across Ministers who have not seen the self-evident quality of Opposition amendments, so we cannot accept that as a basic criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) on the previous amendment, I do not approach these amendments—I intend to devote most of my time to persuading the Minister to accept amendment No. 12—pessimistically. As the Minister has said that he looks carefully and constructively at positive proposals, this amendment, more than any, should appeal to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends may criticise me for the terms of the amendment, as it is endorsing and adopting the philosophy of the Conservative party in saying that there should be a relationship between service and performance and turnover and profit. Surely nothing would appeal more to Conservative Members than those terms and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
philosophy behind them. Given the approach of Conservative Members, I am travelling hopefully, at least amendment No. 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these amendments, particularly amendment No. 12, I hope to explore the basis on which emoluments and allowances will be paid to board members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the Minister's observation when he sought to reject our amendment slightly to enlarge the board to accommodate the type of people we suggested should serve on the agency. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The size of the board is at the heart of our debate on the amendments. I incline to a small board. The agency's functions are limited. I have never made any secret of that fact or sought to hide it. Indeed, the criticism from Opposition Members has been that it is a small agency with limited responsibilities. It is proper to keep the size of the agency's governing body to a scale appropriate to its functions."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman was urging the Committee to reject an amendment but to accept the principle he described. I particularly noted the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"proper to keep the size of the agency's governing body to a scale appropriate to its functions." — [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 4 June 1985; c. 48.]</p></blockquote>
It may be evident from some of our amendments—it will certainly become more evident when we consider clause 2—that there is a division of opinion between the Minister and the Opposition on the character, nature and role of the agency. We certainly disagree with some Back-Bench Conservative Members who seek in some of their amendments to emasculate the agency, if not to abolish the concept of it. We propose that the agency should have a bigger role in a variety of ways than that suggested by the Minister on Second Reading and since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest in amendment No. 12 that the allowances and emoluments of the members of the agency should be related to the size, character and performance of its role. We can assess the potential cost of allowances and emoluments to the agency only by reference to the figures for BNOC. We need to look at those figures to establish how the scale of allowances and emoluments should be related to the performance, size and structure of the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said at our previous sitting, the corporation—some of whose functions the new agency will adopt—has a board consisting of nine people—a chairman, a chief executive and seven members. As the pleas that we made on Tuesday were unsuccessful, the new agency will have a chairman and two to four members. We were also told that there would be no official member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to BNOC's accounts, allowances and emoluments cost £286,000 in 1982. But that figure is misleading, because it straddles the old BNOC and the corporation in its revised, post-Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 form. In determining the expenditure that we could expect on emoluments and allowances for the new agency, we should refer rather to the figure given in the same set of accounts for December 1982—by which time BNOC had lost some of its functions. That figure was £93,000. In 1983 it was £147,000 and it rose to £159,000 in 1984. I cannot judge how modest or otherwise those figures are because that would depend on the number of board meetings and the corporation's activities at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
We are also considering what the chairman of the agency should be paid. The chairman of BNOC in its stripped-down form received £18,000 in 1982, rising to £19,000 in 1984, and the figure has not changed since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, the chairman of the corporation whose functions are to be partly—or, in principle, wholly—transferred to the agency received £19,000 in 1984 and the cost of emoluments and allowances was £159,000. Those figures appear on page 20 of the 1984 accounts. The highest-paid member of the corporation received £48,000. I assume that that was Mr. Goskirk, the chief executive —the full-time chief official of the corporation—so that figure does not concern us here. The figures relevant to the amendments, and to the comparisons that we seek from the Minister, are £159,000 and £19,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But those emoluments were based on a corporation functioning at a different level of activity from that proposed for the new agency. The corporation was buying and selling 870,000 barrels of oil a day. Of that total, 435,000 barrels in 1984 represented participation oil, and 175,000 were third party barrels—ordinary commercial arrangements that the corporation had entered into and in which, although it has caused offence to Conservative Members, the agency may still be able to trade. Indeed, Conservative Members have tabled an amendment to remove that possibility. The corporation also managed on behalf of the Government and the Crown 260,000 barrels a day of royalty-in-kind oil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the size and character of the corporation's activities, although there was no relationship between payments to the chairman and members and the corporation's turnover and performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation had another major area of commercial activity; it bought and sold—very profitably-800,000 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas. On clause 2, I shall seek to explore the role of the new agency in LPG trading, because it was a considerable commercial activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The turnover of BNOC in crude oil was more than £9.5 billion. However, that figure is slightly misleading and should not be used as a basis for any relationship between emoluments, payments and allowances and turnover, because of that £9-5 billion, about £6 billion—although I can hardly believe my own figure—was on a saleback basis. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that, because I do not want to give the Committee false or misleading figures. I hope that he will give us the figures for BNOC's turnover in crude oil, net of saleback. Saleback was such an automatic process that I always tended to leave it out in calculating the role of participation oil in the security of oil supplies, or in any other respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BNOC's turnover in 1983 was 20 per cent. higher than in the previous year. Basically, of course, that was because of the decline of the dollar, but in the same period the corporation lost £35.9 million in crude oil transactions in the terrible months at the back end of last year and the beginning of this year. I do not suggest that Lord Croham or members of the board should have taken a cut in pay. We excuse and absolve them from responsibility for those losses, because, in our view, they were the result of direct Government intervention, which prevented BNOC from taking corrective action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not saying that the emoluments to the chairman and members of the BNOC should bear any relation to the company's turnover and profit, but the £19,000 a year paid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
to the chairman and the emoluments of members should bear some relationship to the type, character and size of the present BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the LPG market and the 800,000 tonnes produced. The turnover was $190 million. That represents a formidable and successful commercial activity. The profit on that turnover was £8.3 million in 1983—when losses were incurred on the crude oil operation. LPG was a successful and skilfully operated feature of BNOC' s activities and that aspect will figure in our discussions on clause 2. I am drawing the Committee's attention to that success now, because it is basic to my proposal that there should be some relationship between emoluments and allowances and the turnover and profitability of the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £8.3 million profit on LPG represents $3 to $4 a tonne and was an important and successful aspect of BNOC's commercial activities. That turnover and profit may have justified paying the chairman £19,000 and the members of the board a total allowance of £159,000. I am not sure whether Mr. Goskirk claimed allowances as chief executive and as a member of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine those payments in the light of what the Minister wants the agency to be. That is why I quoted what the Minister said on Tuesday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is proper to keep the size of the agency's governing body to a scale appropriate to its functions." — [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 4 June 1985; c. 48.]</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 12 does not undermine the efforts that we shall make on clause 2 to beef up the agency. If we accepted the structure and the type of agency that the Minister proposes, we should look for a scale of emoluments and payment to the chairman appropriate to the expected turnover and profitability of the new agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend made any comparisons between the salaries of other chairmen appointed by the Minister and the turnover and profitability of their industries? I am thinking of the chairman of the National Coal Board. How does his salary relate to the turnover of the NCB?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be out of order if I engaged in a detailed discussion of the financial arrangements made with Mr. MacGregor, but I hope that it will be in order to allude to the matter later, because I feel that it provides a good basis for discussion of the principle that I suggest in deciding what members of the agency should be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Portillo	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Enfield, Southgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does this mean that the hon. Gentleman has been converted to the MacGregor principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always been a pragmatic person, and I treat each case on its merits. I am not endorsing some massive principle; I am merely exploring a possibility. I only hope that if the "MacGregor principle" is applied to Mr. MacGregor, he will be bankrupt in the not too distant future, as his contribution to the coal industry in the past 12 months would scarcely merit payment on the basis of performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I see your slight anxiety that I may be wandering out of line, Mr. Knox. I have allowed myself to be misled. Nevertheless, I feel that an allusion to the matter might be useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it occurred to my hon. Friend that someone appointed to the agency might be in deficit after 12 months' trade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting that that might be true of the chairman of the NCB at present. But I trust that this agency will be much more positive, profitable and successful, especially if the Minister accepts some of our amendments on clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would, of course, be out of order for us to examine the principles governing the salary and allowances paid to the chairman of the NCB. However, it would be useful if the Minister could give us his assessment of the hours or days to be worked by the part-time chairman, of the agency, and of the nature of his work, and compare it with the work of a full-time chairman in another public sector organisation for which the Department is responsible. The NCB certainly springs to mind in that context, and I should welcome a detailed description of its chairman's conditions of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's invaluable assistance, and I may well pick up his point as I develop my case. Amendment No. 12 is intended to elicit a bit more about the allowances and emoluments paid to the chairman. So far, the Minister of State has been most courteous and informative. We have had none of the written answers tucked away on Fridays which have been such a prominent feature of some Ministers in the past year or two. As I told the Minister at the time, the way in which he announced the appointments to the board was particularly appreciated by the Opposition. We are peeling off the layers one by one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me try to recover my train of thought. Before the very proper and helpful interventions from both sides of the Committee, I outlined the size and structure of BNOC's business—its turnover, the amount of oil it handled, the LPG and the money it made or lost in 1983–84. For the purpose of our debate on the amendments, especially amendment No. 12, let us use those figures to calculate the potential cost of the emoluments and payments of the agency chairman, although, as I have said, we do not accept that that is the correct basis. I am putting these figures forward in the hope that the Minister will helpfully provide information about the activity and size of the new agency under its limited and restricted role, which he described in c.48 on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall have a shot at establishing the turnover and level of activity of the agency, based on the Minister's criteria for its operation. Although the power will exist in clause 2—if the Conservative Members' amendment does not succeed—the agency will not trade in 175,000 barrels of oil a day, under the commercial third party arrangement. The Minister has given the impression that he is not particularly keen on the agency doing that. We shall try to explore the loss of that barrelage more fully on clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that he does not expect, except in circumstances that he has described, that the new agency will trade in 175,000 barrels a day of third-party oil? Does the Minister have any estimate of how many barrels of third party oil the agency will endeavour to trade in for the first 12 months? He has very strong views about what the agency should do. Therefore, he should not shuffle off the responsibility onto the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
In addition, the agency will not trade in the 435,000 barrels of participation oil. Participation agreements are to be maintained and transferred lock, stock and barrel, but the Minister has said in a policy statement—which does not have the force of law—that the agency will not exercise those participation oil rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, by chance, the agency exercised the participation arrangements because the Government wished it to do so, the emoluments of those in control would quadruple under the amendment. I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's wish to link emoluments and performance, but so much of what the agency will do, either under the Minister's proposals or under the hon. Gentleman's amendment, will depend on Government policy that it is extraordinary that the pay should be affected by matters that are in the Government's hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have noticed since the hon. Gentleman has been in the House that he has good, sharp rational thinking, which is reflected in his challenges. I accept his stricture in one regard. The problem is that I am unfolding the Opposition argument without explaining what we would wish the agency to do under clause 2. I shall be in a better position to answer the hon. Gentleman after we have explained the approach that we shall take to the role and function of the agency under clause 2. I am not ducking the point. Some of the Opposition amendments to clause 2 will seek to give the agency the right to do certain things without the control of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(1)	<i>(a)</i> gives the agency power to enter into agreements on royalty oil and the management of pipelines and storage installations. The remainder of the clause allows the Secretary of State to do certain other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we leave clause 2 unamended, the point raised by he hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) will be valid, as the only way in which the agency can improve its turnover, performance and profitability will be at the behest of the Secretary of State. Why should people receive extra emoluments and payments as a result of decisions made by someone else, rather than of their own commercial decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may find a flavour of what we are seeking if he looks at the amendments that we have already tabled to clause 2. For example, amendment No. 35 on royalty oil seeks to empower the agency and not the Secretary of State to handle the royalty oil. I am an amateur draftsman but that is my intention in amendment No. 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has made his point, but I do not think he need anticipate the discussion of amendments to clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not, Mr. Knox. I hope, however that my argument was valid in dealing with the point raised by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate which I did not want to duck, but was trying to relate to our arguments on amendment No. 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to sketch out at least a profile of how we see the new agency developing from the Minister's guidelines. We have this new agency which is not trading in participation oil and not trading to any extent in third party oil, so we are removing over 600,000 barrels a day
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
from the quantity of oil now handled by BNOC. We are left with an agency managing the Crown's royalty oil to the extent of about 260,000 barrels a day. I have tried to work out the value of that oil—could the Minister tell us what it is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like the Minister to accept the principle of amendment No. 26, but it is also an exploratory amendment. I calculate the turnover of the new agency to be about £2.4 billion, and that figure will decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is also taking an unfair, non-commercial and unenterprising attitude to the agency's role as an LPG trader. I have explained how successful and how profitable —to the Government, to the state and the corporation—LPG trading has been, even since 1982 and the severance of the upstream from the trading side. It is an astonishing decision, and we shall challenge it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we remove LPG from our calculations of the agency's activities, we are reduced to a turnover of £2.4 billion for the 260,000 barrels of royalty oil managed and traded on behalf of the Crown. There will be virtually nothing else, except the management fees that the agency may pick up under its pipeline installation functions. We shall have the opportunity to consider the latter on clause 2. The figures do not add up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that we can determine the size and character of emoluments and payments to the chairman and board members of the new agency, I am trying to discover from the Minister some idea of his thinking on the agency's turnover and performance. The amendments, especially amendment No. 12, give the Minister an opportunity to enlighten the Committee on the minimum size and structure of the business created under the new arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that provisions in clause 2 could enhance or develop that role, but existing guidelines and policy statements from the Minister have no force of law. I want to know the minimum size of the business that the agency will perform. With that observation, the Committee will be able to take an overall view of, for example, the chairman's salary. Later I shall have a shot at how much he should be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. JOHN FORRESTER 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>I shall not give you a resume of what I have said, Mr. Forrester, because I am sure that your advisers will keep me in order.</p>
	<p>I also wish to compare BNOC's existing known administrative expenses with the potential administrative expenses of the new agency. The annual reports are invaluable. At our previous sitting I quoted from page 11 of the 1984 report and accounts in relation to rates. Page 11 also give BNOC's administrative costs in 1984:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Administrative expenses for the year amounted to £6.4 million, compared to £4.7 million in 1983. Of this increase, some £1.6 million"</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>—an enormous increase—
	<br><blockquote><p>"represents provision for costs incurred in 1984 and to be incurred in 1985 in respect of the Corporation's former offices which were vacated in May 1984 and remain unlet."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>I drew the Minister's attention to that paragraph at our previous sitting when we discussed an amendment on rates.</p>
	<p>The agency will inherit all those costs, including those from the remaining unlet offices and any space vacated by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
the agency. It is not as easy to push property and to fill offices in central London as it used to be. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With this exception, administrative costs were contained during the year, reflecting stabilisation of staff numbers at an average of 123 in 1984 compared to 128 in 1983."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>There should be some relationship between emoluments and payments to the board and the costs and size of the operation in terms of its staff. The BNOC staff is 123. Are we right in believing that the new agency will have 35 staff?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the relationship between emoluments and administrative costs should be inverse, so that the more successfully that the management reduce costs, the more they should be paid? Alternatively, is he suggesting that the more gold-plated taps there are in a building, the more management should be paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most certainly not. I am tempted to establish first a general relationship so that we can discuss how it will work. The amendment is designed to establish a relationship between the agency's overall performance and size and its costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be some relationship with the size of staff to be managed. If the size of staff to be managed is 35 instead of 123, surely the administrative costs, the emoluments and the chairman's salary should go down. I can understand the point made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate that they should be paid more because of the reduction in staff numbers, but there comes a limit to the way in which one can seek cost efficiency on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one, apart, perhaps, from the hon. Gentleman, has suggested that the BNOC was overmanned, given the scale of its operations. A total of 123 staff does not seem to constitute overmanning in relation to the size and character of the job that BNOC was doing. I certainly do not believe that with a staff of 30 or 35, one needs a part-time chairman who is paid £19,000 a year. There must be some correlation between the organisation's size, performance, turnover and staff numbers, and the small, slimmed-down version of the board that the Minister described as being what he wanted during Tuesday's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that one cannot have cost-efficiency arrangements in both types of operation. The ratio between the size of staff and the costs incurred by the board should be a reasonable one. If staff numbers are reduced from 123 to 35, not on grounds of cost efficiency, but because of a change in the role and function of the agency, emoluments paid to board members should reflect that diminished role and function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my explanation has been reasonable and will carry the hon. Gentleman with me on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Stevens	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Talking of the proportion of the cost of the board to the number of employees, the Bill proposes to reduce the number of members of the board, which will surely have the same effect as reducing salary levels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to fathom what the hon. Gentleman said, and I hope that he will correct me if I am wrong. Is he saying that the new agency, with a lower turnover and level of activity, should have board members whose emoluments are unaffected by such reductions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the emoluments paid to board members should be reduced in line with any reduction in staff numbers. However, if the board is much smaller, as proposed in the Bill, the amount of emoluments paid out will decrease automatically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Overall, there will be a cut; but payments made to individual board members should also be related to staff numbers. I now understand the point that the hon. Gentleman was making, and apologise for my thick-headedness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite rightly, there will be an automatic reduction in emoluments, because the board will be smaller. But there should also be some relationship between payments to individual members of the board — including the chairman — and the overall performance, size and character of the business that they are operating. The reduction should not be achieved merely by having fewer board members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can now carry the hon. Gentleman with me on that point—I am increasingly hopeful, now that I have two potential supporters of the amendment. I have been working on obtaining their support, and they are examining my case rationally enough to leave me grounds for hoping that I might be able to persuade them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I give my hon. Friend an illustration? I recently visited the RAF station from which I was demobbed a long time ago—RAF Cottishall, where the Jaguar operational squadrons are based—and I noticed that all the aircrew were of the rank of flight lieutenant or above. Twenty or 30 years ago, the majority of pilots on any RAF squadron were either non-commissioned sergeant pilots or pilot officers. That suggests a change in the nature of the task performed by those air crews. That change is reflected in the much higher salary and rank of those doing the job in 1985. That illustrates the point made by the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. I missed National Service by about three months, so I do not have that valuable experience. I cannot draw on my hon. Friend's wealth of experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not draw on that any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not, Mr. Forrester. If I had, your stricture would bring me back to order immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realised that all those flight lieutenants were putting oil into the aircraft, otherwise the hon. Gentleman would have been out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may certainly be in order when we discuss the pipeline side of the Bill, because the pipeline was built to supply fuel to the RAF. Perhaps the role of flight lieutenant will play a part in our discussions on the pipeline installations—which incidentally, were built to serve the RAF at a time of great need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I devoted my speech almost entirely to amendment No. 12, which is the operative amendment in this group. We are searching for—but it is clear from the interventions of the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate and for Nuneaton that we have not yet perfected—the notion that there should be a relationship between the size, character and performance of the new agency and the emoluments and payments to the chairman and members of the board. The perfectly valid interventions in my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
speech show that this is a crude first attempt at establishing how to create that relationship. Nevertheless, I hope that the principle that we are trying to explore in amendment No. 12 has not been damaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the amendment is twofold. If, as the Minister said at our last sitting, the size of the agency should be scaled down to one that is appropriate to its functions, I hope that the part-time chairman's salary and payments to the members will reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, in clause 2 we shall investigate the extent to which the agency could take a more positive, commercial, successful, vibrant and enterprising approach to its functions. Surely, therefore, there should be a provision in the Bill to give initiative, and entrepreneurial incentive to members of the board to expand the role and functions of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's tunnel-vision view of the role of the agency prevails, we should not expect the chairman to receive £19,000 a year. We should be talking about £5,000 or £6,000 in view of the type, scope and character of the agency described by the Minister. To pay more would lead to questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that if the Committee can take a more positive attitude towards the role of the agency when we consider clause 2, it will be possible for the members of the board and the chairman to have rewards and payments which reflect the enterprising view that they take. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) pointed out, that is not a new principle. It has been adopted in a different form as the basis on which Mr. MacGregor was recruited to chair both the steel and the coal industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be improper if I went into detail about that, but it serves as an illustration of this type of operation. If the new chairman and his part-time members have the same impact on the OPA as Mr. MacGregor has had on the coal industry, there should be a new column in brackets "payments by the members and by the chairman to the Secretary of State for damage done to the national interests and the national cause". However I hope and believe that because of the shrewd appointment that the Minister has made and because the agency will be able to flourish and expand if we approach clause 2 in a different spirit from that in which he and some of his hon. Friends are approaching it, it will be possible for the rewards for the chairman and the members of the board to be expanded in a manner justified by an expanding successful and vibrant agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee and I certainly would not wish to be out of order. I shall not follow my hon. Friend too far in making references to the chairman of the National Coal Board. However, I can see some merit in our maintaining that comparison for a substantial period, at least throughout the Committee stage of the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend will return from time to time to the question of payment by results in reverse; it might persuade Mr. MacGregor to get out while the going is good. I shall make no further reference to the chairman of the NCB except to tell the Minister-that I hope that he will be able to provide for the purposes of comparison, the detailed information that we need about both the chairman of this agency, the nature and hours of his work and the chairman of the NCB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
I have certain misgivings about the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has approached this matter. I am sure that he will forgive me, but these amendments could be seen as payment by result amendments: my hon. friend may wish to persuade me that is not so. I have certain anxieties about the practice of payments by results in the public service. Throughout the modern history of this country, we have not had much experience of that. I have been looking at the records and history of my own constituency to see whether I can find examples, within the public service where payment by results has applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of our former careers, Mr. Forrester, you will be aware, as I am, that for a period British state education was blighted by the operation of payments by results—the system which is touched on or made possible by the amendments. I shall not speak at great length, but in the village of Westworth in my constituency there has been for a long time a splendid and happy school which provides a classic illustration of the weaknesses of payments by results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want my hon. Friend to pay attention to this incident. About 100 years ago, an inspector of schools arrived at Wentworth village school when a system of payment by results operated. He gave a poor report of the teacher whose work he was assessing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a long story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a long story, and moreover it is relevant. I shall therefore continue if the hon. Gentleman, who is obviously frustrated because he cannot follow his shares in the financial journals, will allow me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those days Wentworth was an estate village and the Earl and Countess of Fitzwilliam, who owned and lived in it, took a marked and paternalistic interest in both the village and the school. They were deeply concerned that an inspector should arrive at their village school and report critically upon the teacher. The secretary, or perhaps the president, of the Board of Education received a letter from the earl expressing his indignation about the inspector's audacity in coming to his village school and reporting critically upon a teacher whom, presumably, the earl had appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My story is relevant to the amendment. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not appreciate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board of Education replied that the inspector would visit the school again. On his return, the earl, the countess, the agent and several aristocratic visitors who were spending a few days at Wentworth House sat at the back of the classroom throughout the visit. That poor inspector of education—I doubt whether it was Arnold himself—probably felt overawed at the sight of half the members of the House of Lords and their wives sitting at the back of the classroom, while he was supposed to be assessing the teacher whom they viewed favourably with a paternalistic indulgence. The result was that on the second occasion the inspector found a degree of merit that he had not noticed before, and the teacher received a remarkably glowing assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
It may be that the inspector judged harshly on the first occasion; or that on the second occasion he decided that discretion was more important than honest judgment and appraisal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Forrester. I wonder whether the teacher can come to the end of his lesson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the teacher had come to the end of his lesson, and was about to discuss the merits of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend. We all have different conceptions of payment by results, but as I have the second largest majority in the House, I am rather in favour of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say whether my hon. Friend will be in the same position in the league after the next election, but I certainly expect his majority to increase enormously —although, if he will allow me to say so, that may be a reflection not of the splendid service which he gives but of the appalling service given by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears to have escaped the hon. Member for Bedfordshire,. North (Mr. Skeet) that there are parts of the public service in which payment by results is inappropriate because it is not properly measurable, because tangibles may not be involved and also because it may be open to abuse. Hon. Members may feel that, in the case which I have related to them, there was at least an element of impropriety; but I am not saying that, and as the incident occurred so long ago it does not really matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are normally grounds for anxiety about the principle of payment by results. That is often true in industry. There used to be a lot more horse trading. My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) will be aware that miners' pay used to be determined largely by horse trading underground. My father once offered one of his men three-fifths of a shift for some additional work. That man was not very good at mathematics—far too many people are not—and was so incensed by the offer that he went to the trade union branch to try to persuade members to come out on strike. He felt that three-fifths was not fair and that he was being robbed; he wanted half!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we try to promote good relationships we must move away from payment by results. My hon. Friend will understand that I view his amendment with a certain amount of trepidation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) asked me several detailed points. He asked me how much time the chairman might be expected to spend in fulfilling his appointment. The duties that he could be expected to perform were fully discussed with Mr. Dunkerley before he accepted the appointment. I believe that a person appointed to such a post should decide how much time he needs to devote to the performance of those duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked me about the turnover of BNOC and the relevance of sale-back to it. Turnover is about £9.5 billion, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. If we exclude sale-back it is about £5 billion. In answer to his question about the value of royalty in kind oil, £2,206 million worth was sold in 1984–85.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
The agency will deal with royalty-in-kind oil. The hon. Gentleman seems to be under a slight confusion, as royalty-in-kind oil will not feature in the agency's turnover. It will be acting as an agent for the Secretary of State in respect of that oil. If participation oil should ever be taken with the Secretary of State's consent, the agency's turnover would expand not just two or three times but by much more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, BNOC's turnover, including sale-back, is £5 billion. Given the qualification that I have just made, the agency's turnover could be as low as £2 million to £3 million a year, although it will be handling royalty-in-kind oil worth about £2 billion a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's questions. He went into the financial background in considerable detail. I recognise the hon. Gentleman's concern. It is important to make sure that the agency is run properly and that its members are properly remunerated for the limited but extremely important task that they must perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to the proposed powers of direction in clause 5, the board of the agency is the agency. The effect of amendments Nos. 26, 27 and 28 is that the board alone should be able to determine its remuneration, allowances and pensions and, therefore, members should be able to pay themselves whatever they like. The amendment would mean that the board would be answerable to no one; I cannot believe that that is what the hon. Gentleman wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the agency's turnover would be between £2 million and £3 million a year. In referring to the gross profits of £8.3 million, BNOC's annual report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This amount includes total fees of £2.2 million received for marketing royalty oil on behalf of the Secretary of State for Energy and for managing the Government's Land Pipelines and Storage System."</p></blockquote>
It seems that the only work that the agency will do is to manage the pipelines and that there will be very little revenue from any other sources. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, we are dealing with this on an agency basis. The turnover of the agency will be as I described, but the agency will handle the royalty-in-kind oil. I am making the distinction in the context of the amendment. It is important to do that so that hon. Members realise what the effect of the amendment would be. I hope that I have clarified the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. The Minister said that the turnover of the new agency would be about £2.2 million. Is that estimate based on the all-embracing figure that covered the fees for royalty oil and the management of the pipelines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say £2.2 million: I said it could be £2 million to £3 million. Of course I do not know at this stage exactly what it will be, but I was trying to help the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister; he is being helpful. If the purchase and sale of royalty oil is not included in turnover, I presume that it was not included in BNOC's turnover of £9,562 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. Gentleman makes those simple deductions correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make the agency responsible only to itself on what it pays and I do not think that that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
is the hon. Gentleman's intention or what the Committee wants. It would take away responsibility from the Secretary of State for board members and their pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the hon. Gentleman regards amendment No. 12 as the most important in the group. I understand the thinking behind it and we shall examine whether there is a way of relating the agency's financial performance to its success in carrying out its function. As my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) said, it would be strange to relate emoluments to turnover, and I do not think that that would necessarily encourage efficiency. I should not like to mislead or deceive the Committee; it will certainly not be easy to find a way of relating performance as suggested. One could not in this case relate members' pay directly to turnover or profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the agency's functions is to enhance security of supply, and that objective could run counter to maximising profits. Furthermore, as I said, the body will act primarily as an agent and not as a principal. Therefore, profits will be not so much a function of the skill with which the agency performs its trading as of the Government's skill in devising agency agreements. That will determine whether there is efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 12 would require any sums paid by the agency to its members to bear a direct relationship to turnover and profit. As the provision is intended to give the agency authority to reimburse its members for reasonable expenses such as travel and subsistence inccurred on agency business, it would be somewhat perverse to try to link such payments to the agency's turnover or profits. While I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's aim, I do not believe that amendment No. 12 would achieve it. I do not criticise the amendment specifically on that basis but, as I said, given the nature and functions of the agency, the objective would be extremely difficult to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the efficiency or otherwise of the system would reflect the Government's skill rather than that of the agency. In view of the way in which the Government have handled BNOC's finances in the past 12 months, the Minister should take a cut in pay immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have responded helpfully and rationally to my presentation of the amendment. I acknowledge that amendment No. 12 represents a trailer to what we want the agency to do under clause 2. The agency will have a pathetically restricted role. When we discuss the problems of staffing and transfers, that will reinforce my point. The Minister's blinkered view of the role and function of the agency does not give us much hope. On the basis of that view, people would gain very little from our amendment. But as I said, we were preparing the way for an agency doing something commercially more interesting than what the Minister has described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the agency is to have a turnover of only £2.2 million and if the chairman's role is merely to be to pass things on, I certainly withdraw my suggestion that he should be paid £5,000 to £6,000. If his function is to be that limited, nothing more than an occasional meal and an allowance for turning up will be involved. I trust that we shall not wake up one morning to find one of those nice blue Department of Energy press releases telling us that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
chairman has been paid £10,000, or something similar, for the very limited functions that the Minister has in mind for the agency. However, we shall have an opportunity on clause 2 to explain more fully—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the hon. Gentleman intends to withdraw the amendment. I wonder to what extent he is influenced by the attack that was launched on his amendment by his hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Labour party creative tension is the order of the day. Did the hon. Gentleman call it a vicious attack? A gentle soul like my hon. Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend does me a kindness. I did not in any way attack his proposal; I merely expressed a slight reservation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Based on my hon. Friend's military experience, that reservation may have been justified. We all draw on our experience. However, that is not why I intend to withdraw the amendment. I was coming to the reason. We shall wait and see the shape of the agency that develops in clause 2, and then perhaps the idea underlying the amendment will have greater force. Until that time, and because we want to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 7, line 2, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>`(who may be the chairman or another member'.</p></blockquote>
I shall give the Committee the opportunity to deal with this amendment at remarkable speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing I want to say is that I have never yet heard of a case in which the town clerk is also the mayor. It would be an absurd combination. The agency's chairman should not be provided with a ready-made and very concentrated empire. It is not that we lack faith in the people to be appointed, but it is absurd to think that the chairman could also be the chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should accept the consequence of his logic and realise that that could happen if there were only two people on the agency. We tried to persuade the Minister to have a minimum of three, but he insisted on a minimum of two. Surely, he cannot say that one of the two is not only the chairman but the chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an illustration. I discovered the other day that magistrates can—and frequently do—sit in Crown Courts. Normally, two lay magistrates sit with a judge. That is perfectly proper and reasonable. But sometimes one does not turn up, in which case only one lay magistrate sits with the judge. If they then disagree, the view of the lay magistrates does not count, because the judge's decision is overriding. It is ridiculous for one lay magistrate to sit with a judge, because it does not matter whether he is there or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if the agency has only two people, one of whom is chairman and chief executive and the other is not, that other person will not count. So unless the Minister can give us a guarantee that if the chairman is also the chief executive there must be two other members who are able to overrule him, there is no point in having any other members of the agency. Our amendment is logical, and I hope that it will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill seeks to assure a reasonable and sensible degree of flexibility for the agency to appoint as chief executive the person it thinks most suitable, whether or not he is a member of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) is using amendment No. 19 in a probing manner to establish what will happen. Clause 1(2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency shall consist of—
	<ol>
	<li>a full-time or part-time chairman; and</li>
	<li>such number of other full-time or part-time members, not being less than two".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The clause thus provides built-in protection against the situation that the hon. Gentleman envisages, and I hope therefore that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to be brief in moving the amendment and may not have made myself clear. When I referred to two people, I was describing actual attendance. If members of the board do not attend to their duties assiduously, it is possible that only two people might be present at any time. That is the possible danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Minister has, once again, committed himself to flexibility, and as the Department, having been warned, presumably would not wish the problem to arise, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 7, line 7, leave out sub-paragraph (2) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) The Agency shall employ—
	<ol>
	<li>a corporate and legal adviser;</li>
	<li>a general manager for oil supply and trading;</li>
	<li>a manager for land pipelines;</li>
	<li>a manager for personnel;</li>
	<li>a manager for finance;</li></ol>
and such other officers and persons as it may determine.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 20, in page 7, line 8, leave out 'it' and insert `the Secretary of State'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 17 is characteristic of our approach to clause 1 and schedule 1. We are using amendments to flush out a better idea of the structure, role and performance of the new agency. We were given little information on Second Reading. The Bill was so hastily cobbled together, and the announcement of the measure was so sudden, that there has been no time for the usual consultation on the setting up of new organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are using the amendments to discover as best we can, details of the organisation — its character, its membership and the type of people who will be running it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 follows that purpose, which I hope is rational. We have done quite well so far; we have found out the name of the chairman; we already knew who is to be the chief executive; we know the name of at least one part-time member of the board. We do not know how much he will be paid, although we have explained our views forcefully to the Minister. We have gained a better impression of the Minister's narrow view of the agency's character in terms of turnover and of the limited role that he intends for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here,we are discussing what management structure would suit the agency's functions. In amendment No. 17 I have had a shot at suggesting one. It is difficult because it needs a graph with lines of responsibility, which would not have got past the parliamentary draftsman. One cannot
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
make a pictorial presentation in a Bill. I should have liked to include managerial flow charts. I could not find a way of writing them into the Bill so I had to do it in words. Amendment No. 17 is a rough shot at a management structure for the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had to start with what I had, not from a green field site or a blank page. I started with the existing BNOC management structure helpfully outlined on page 2 of the annual report which lists the six managerial officers, the chief executive and their functions. Mr. Goskirk was chief executive. Mr. Finch was the financial member of the management committee. Mr. Berkeley was legal and participation secretary to the corporation. Mr. James dealt with corporate services. From experience, I imagine that he acted as public relations officer as well. Mr. Johnstone covered supply, Mr. Millar was with trading of crude oil and products, and Mr. Vaughan, who is now the new chief executive, dealt with trading of liquefied petroleum gas and land pipelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the structure of BNOC as it stands. From our discussions on the amendment we want to discover whether the agency will follow that structure or change it to meet its own operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is curious that, despite the Minister's description of a limited, stripped-down agency, under the Bill the agency inherits almost all BNOC's formal roles. From later amendments it is clear that Conservative Members have also spotted that discrepancy. Under clause 3, whatever has not been stopped or concluded—property, liabilities and rights — will go lock, stock and barrel to the agency. Obviously the winding down of the participation arrangements—the oil that has actually been taken—is underway at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm my list of the roles of OPA — the new agency — if the Bill is unamended? Incidentally, I discovered that gopa is a soviet word for mountain side. I do not know whether there is anything sinister in that coincidence. I shall drop the "G" and call the agency OPA so that there is no confusion with soviet hillsides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The OPA will inherit everything and retain at least five functions and roles, however theoretical they are. I shall describe them and perhaps the Minister will say whether I am right. First, the agency will be the manager of the land pipelines system and will be responsible for its installation. At present that is a function of BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the agency will be the keeper of participation agreements. That is a shorthand term. The agency will enter into participation agreements under clause 2 and will be the keeper of existing participation agreements, which I assume will be transferred under clause 3 with the generic collection of liabilities, rights, properties and so on. In addition, under clause 2 the agency will have the power to enter into new participation agreements. The agency will be the keeper of existing participation agreements and the negotiator of all future participation agreements, which is a function of BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the agency will handle on behalf of the Crown royalty oil in kind. Again, that is a function fulfilled by BNOC as it is now composed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the agency will inherit all existing contracts. We shall explore that further on clause 3, or perhaps on clause 2, although I find one part of clause 2 rather confusing. When we discuss the matter in more detail we shall be able to investigate how far existing contracts can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
be wound up. But I understand that some of them are long-term contracts and that the approval of the other parties would be required before they were wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a number of existing contracts—the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) shakes his head. Let me put it in the form of a question in case I have got it wrong. Even after the commencement date of the new agency, will there not be a number of existing contracts of one kind or another which the new agency will be forced to inherit, manage, maintain and perform? I see that as the fourth function—however limited a function it may be—of the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly—this has obviously upset Conservative Back Benchers — under clause 2(1)(d) the agency will have the right to buy or sell other oil if authorised by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new agency, then, will inherit five roles or functions from BNOC: to manage a line pipelines system and an installation storage system; to keep, draft and implement new participation agreements; to handle on behalf of the Crown royalty oil in kind; probably to hold a number of existing contracts which will not have been terminated with the abolition of BNOC and the commencement of the new agency; and possibly to buy or sell other petroleum on its own account if authorised by the Secretary of State. However much the agency will be slimmed down, the powers, functions and roles conferred on it by the Bill will be very similar to those of BNOC at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not foresee a residual advisory role, albeit minimal, for the Department, in the sense that BNOC has such a role now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not written into clause 2; however, an amendment put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) might give it a wider advisory role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listed the five roles or functions that the agency will inherit, although to what extent it will activate them is another matter. We want to know what sort of managerial structure the new agency will have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there will be no difference between the function of the new agency and that of BNOC in the fulfilment of land pipelines and installation, although new clause 1 suggests ways in which the agency could enhance that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that in transferring the management function, the Government are transferring the same function that the oil corporation had in managing pipelines and installations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nominal staff for the land pipelines division of the present BNOC is 14, of which only nine are full-time. The other five places are filled by temporary and short-term contracts because of the damage done to confidence and enthusiasm resulting from the uncertainty about the Government's thinking over the past 18 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman thinks will be retained, but does he agree that while royalty oil and the management of the pipelines will be handled by the agency, custody of the participation arrangements is a dormant operation that may be revived?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
Clause 2(1)	<i>(d)</i> can be operated only with consent, so that is a dormant provision. Management of existing contracts is transitional at best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman, but he has anticipated my analysis of the situation in regard to the other functions. I think that I shall answer at least part of his question as I develop my analysis of the management of the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we can agree that in fulfilling the management of the landline and pipelines function of the BNOC there will be no change, unless the Minister says that the agency will do less. It will be a direct transfer of responsibility from the corporation to the agency. I said that the nominal establishment was 14 people. They have commercial, engineering, management and financial skills, but the establishment has been under strength for some time, for reasons which I shall explain when we debate amendment No. 30. Furthermore, of that nominal establishment, some are on short-term contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the participation and here I challenge the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) who implied that participation agreements, although not activated, are dormant and therefore require no managerial supervision. For someone who knows a lot about participation agreements—the hon. Gentleman and I are old hands—he must realise that participation agreements cannot be considered to be dormant. They cannot be put away in a cupboard to let the dust settle on them. The contrary is true. To deal with royalty oil in kind it is necessary to obtain certain information from technical committees operating in the North sea, even in lifting, accruing and aggregating on behalf of the Crown. So royalty oil in kind will mean involvement with North sea technical committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The keeping of election notices—an essential part of the participation agreement—cannot be left in the corner and forgotten either, because situations change. People farm into the agreements; others leave the field, licence or block in question. In each case, the participation agreement has to be updated, line by line, paragraph by paragraph, every time it is altered by any of the partners. Carrying out such updating will provide a vital role for the new agency. I hope that the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North will agree with me on that, although I doubt it; he does not believe in participation agreements. The Minister believes in them, but the hon. Gentleman does not. The agency will have to be vigilant in the maintenance and updating of all aspects of participation agreements. That will be an intrinsic part of its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may some day wish to activate those participation agreements. He will find it extremely difficult to do so if they contain wrong licencees, and if partners have changed their transportation lifting and accrual systems for collecting oil—in other words, if the agency has not been vigilant in keeping abreast of such changes and updating the agreements accordingly. The value and import of participation agreements will depend on the vigilance that the agency shows in keeping the agreements up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman, despite his enmity towards participation agreements of any kind, will agree with me that if we are to have them, they will need to be maintained and brought up to date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that it takes from six months to a year, depending on the provisions of the participation agreement, to reactivate an option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than aware of that: we are divided precisely over the issue of what value the agreements have without being activated in some form, in safeguarding security of supply for oil. I recommend that the hon. Gentleman watch this space. Amendments to clause 2 will deal with present and future agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take the Minister at his word that the maintenance of participation agreements plays an intrinsic part in our security of oil supply, together with royalty in kind, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the updating of existing participation agreements is not a mere formality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(1) provides that new agreements be entered into—a formidable task. I hope that during the debate on clause 2 we shall examine carefully what participation agreements are. They are, as the hon. Gentleman and the Committee know, formidable documents. Drafting new agreements to ensure that there are no loopholes in them will be a major function of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, as regards participation agreements, maintaining notices, obtaining information essential to the lifting of even royalty oil, documentation, updating agreements to accommodate alterations caused by farm-ins or sell-outs, and the drafting and implementation of new agreements, the agency does not face a minimal task. And as security of the oil supply will be an essential aspect of its role, the agency should be given a major managerial function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it difficult to decide how to word the amendment. There seemed to be a lot of sense in how BNOC fulfilled the task—by combining the functions in the responsibilities of the legal and participation secretary. It is a highly legalistic arrangement, and should be incorporated with my "corporate and legal adviser". If I could have redrafted my amendment, I would have referred specifically—as BNOC does—to a legal and participation secretary. There should be a participation secretary—such such a role will be important in the new agency—to be vigilant in dealing with present and future participation deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government say that the agency will not activate participation agreements, and so will not deal in participation oil, it will still manage 250,000 barrels of royalty-in-kind oil a day on behalf of the Crown so
	<br><blockquote><p>"a general manager for oil supply and trading"</p></blockquote>
is certainly needed, and, paragraph (b) in amendment No. 17 establishes that as a function. The person will guide the structure of the organisation below him. If we can get the agency to do more, especially in relation to LPG and some participation oil, he will be able to encompass those additional activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not follow the structure of BNOC. I do not know how well it worked, though I am sure that it did work. I find it curious that Mr. Vaughan, who is now the chief executive, was trading in LPG and land pipelines. I see no connection there. If managerial structures should reflect function, I should love to know the managerial relationship between trading in LPG and the maintenance and management of the land pipeline system. Perhaps the Minister will tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the land pipeline system, with installation and maintenance, will be a significant function of the new agency. There was a hotch-potch arrangement
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
under BNOC, though the pipeline division has done a remarkable job since BNOC took it over. We believe that there should be a clear division, headed by a first-class manager to deal with the management and functions in relation to land pipelines and installation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other two aspects—personnel and finance—are self-explanatory and are part and parcel of any such organisation or agency. I am trying to show the Minister that we are thinking constructively about the agency's future. I am glad that he said that the terms of appointment were for at least three years, as people were worried; that the agency would have between six months and two years, and not much more. Such a term means that the Government will be committed to the maintenance and development of the agency. Adopting a managerial structure such as we suggest could enhance and support the function and role that we should like the agency to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) who, with his customary clarity and brevity summed up in a few sentences something which took the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) rather longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's description of the broad functions of the agency was correct: there are the specific functions which we shall debate in clause 2 and there is also the carryover of outstanding obligations and liabilities from BNOC when the agency takes over. I have no doubt—and I commend the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney for this — that all the functions that he listed will be appropriate to the new agency. But that is not for us. It is not for the Committee or the House to try to set out exactly how the agency should be run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the function of the members of the agency whom we appoint to set up a management function, that they believe appropriate. That is a function which Parliament is giving to the agency. I do not want to attribute to the hon. Gentleman more than he is trying to do—he is simply trying to probe to find out what the structure might be—but it is not really appropriate to spell it out as he has done. If one is asking for a blueprint, the hon. Gentleman may have done as good a job as anyone else could do. However, the decision about that blueprint and the functions is for the agency not for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney did not speak, to amendment No. 20, although I notice that it is in the name of his hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy). I am puzzled, especially when I consider the two amendments together. Amendment No. 17 spells out exactly what the management structure should be. When I look at amendment No. 20 I recall the words of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney at our first sitting. He said:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have a jealous feeling that the agency must be independent and have a life and character of its own. It should not be tied too closely to Whitehall and the Civil Service."</p></blockquote>—[	<i> Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A, 23 May 1985; c. 14.]
If we accepted the two amendments, in particular amendment No. 20, which was carefully not spoken to this morning, we would be going precisely against the hon. Gentleman's wishes. In those circumstances, I must ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 20 was included as a mark of respect to the Secretary of State. I was seeking to be helpful. We sought earlier to protect the Department of Energy from the tightened clutches of the Treasury and by inserting the words in the amendment we sought to give the Department of Energy some reason for departmental or personal esteem. Having done that, I am sorry that the Minister should have conducted himself with such contumely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further more, the Minister seems to ignore one of the basic facts which my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) was presenting. In one of those functions there is a minimum responsibility for £5.5 million of trading a day. We are talking about billions of pounds a year. Given that enormous importance, even with this downgraded and smaller organisation, the Minister should have respect for the size of the undertaking and the economic importance that it will continue to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) is quite correct. Of the two amendments that were moved earlier, one tried to take the Treasury out, the other tried to take out the Secretary of State. It is a bit much for the Minister to say that the Opposition are changing things again and putting the Secretary of State back in in amendment No. 20. We believe that the state has a role to play in the new agency, just as it has a major role in BNOC, even if that is only to ensure that the industry is run in the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing wrong with using amendment No. 17 to probe the Secretary of State's mind. On Second Reading he guaranteed the House and the nation that if the country had a critical shortage of oil, we could secure all the supplies we needed. 	<i>The Guardian</i> on 15 May quoted the Minister as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a fall-back the Government had powers in a crisis to control all UK production 'whoever produces it and whatever the contracts may be.'"</p></blockquote>
Presumably the last words were a direct quotation from the Minister's speech on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have every right to probe to discover whether the assurance given to Parliament and to the nation on Second Reading can be exercised in any crisis of oil supplies in this country. That can be done only of the breakup of BNOC and the setting up of the agency is capable of assuring Parliament and the country that we can supply oil even if the agency does not have the same control as BNOC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument, but the agency is not required for this purpose. Section 1 of the Energy Act 1976 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply, acquisition or use of</p></blockquote>
petroleum in a crisis. He does not require the agency. He is vested with powers by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we do not have an organisation like BNOC, closely aligned to Whitehall, in a crisis we shall say, "Is there any organisation to tell us where to go for supplies?" In those circumstances, surely the agency will at least monitor oil supplies on behalf of the Secretary of State's Department and on behalf of the country so that we can get more. There is nothing wrong in debating the numbers or groupings of people who should be employees of the agency. We may not need to press the amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
to a Division but we should probe the Minister on the size of the management staff of the oil pipeline and other sections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I more than agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron). The Opposition are open minded and open spirited. We have none of the Stalinist uniformity that is being imposed on Conservative Members by a person or persons unknown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stefan Terlezki	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that a Conservative Member was being nobbled earlier. One notices the tendency. I was hoping to move on because we shall not press the amendment, but I must register one disagreement with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should be careful of accepting the occasional poisoned chalice from the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). The hon. Member is wrong and I was worried that the Minister confirmed his view that to maintain, improve and modernise participation agreements is a minimal function. I hope that I am misinterpreting the Minister when I say that he endorsed his hon. Friend's remarks. If that is the Minister's view we are even more worried and frightened about the future role of participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the Minister says, participation agreements are under constant change as a result of changes in the North sea — changes in ownership, operatorship, transportation and in patterns of lifting, accruing and aggregating oil. We must be constantly aware of the need to ensure that even if participation agreements are not being activated, they will be in good shape to meet a crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North said that there was no problem because it took six months to implement the notices. We disagree, and believe that it is illogical of the Minister to use participation agreements, without activating them, as a basis for security of supply. That will not be sufficient. We hope that even if the Minister follows his policy, the agency will vigilantly maintain and modernise the agreements. I hope that by endorsing the remarks made by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North, the Minister did not intend to leave the Committee with the impression that he does not consider that to be an important and relevant point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that I had said during the first sitting of the Committee that I wanted the agency to be outside of the clutches of Whitehall. Amendment No. 17 does not place the agency within the clutches of Whitehall. A democratic Committee of the House, not Whitehall, civil servants or Ministers, is recommending a structure for the agency. We are democrats, not bureaucrats, and it is perfectly reasonable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) pointed out, for us to put forward such recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall withdraw the amendment, because I do not think I have had a bad shot at the managerial structure of the agency. Will the Minister give me the not unreasonable assurance that when he draws up the management structure, he will inform the Committee how far out I was in my recommendations for it, and of what kind of structure he adopts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give such a commitment, as the Committee will no longer be sitting then. I am sure that the new body will state how it is
