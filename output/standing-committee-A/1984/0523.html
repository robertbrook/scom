	<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Oil and Pipelines Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Oil and Pipelines Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Buchanan-Smith.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Knox. I am sure that you will keep us on the straight and narrow path of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to use the opportunity that the sittings motion provides to raise two important but unrelated issues that cannot easily be dealt with by amendments, although with some ingenuity it might be possible to do so. The first is urgent and cannot wait until we reach the relevant clause, and the second concerns the whole structure of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue arises out of an assurance given by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary when he wound up on Second Reading. Hon. Members will recall that in that debate I made a specific and proper request to the Government that staff at the British National Oil Corporation should not be compelled to transfer to the new agency but should be given a legitimate and reasonable choice of redundancy and severance terms or a transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made that request because the truncated nature of the new Oil and Pipelines Agency does not offer the range of opportunities, career-wise and otherwise, for younger members of staff to fulfil themselves. After all, although some functions are to be transferred, the nature of OPA will be very different from that of the BNOC. Therefore, it is only fair and reasonable that BNOC staff have the option of joining the new agency or taking severance and redundancy pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was heartened and relieved by the Under-Secretary's reply. The key sentence is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As, fortunately, the Socialist state has not yet dawned in this country the Government have neither means nor intention of forcing BNOC staff to transfer. — [Official Report, 14 May 1985; Vol. 79, c. 253.]</p></blockquote>
I took some comfort from that and the Under-Secretary got a modest cheer for his comment. I was the butt of a good jibe, but I did not care. I thought that I had what I wanted —an assurance made in good faith that no member of the staff of BNOC would have to cross over to the new agency but would have the option of taking severance and redundancy pay instead. The BNOC staff were relieved to have that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore with much regret that I say that that assurance has been dishonoured. Some BNOC staff will be offered employment in the new Oil and Pipelines Agency, and, unless the Minister gives the commitment that we thought had been given, they will not have the choice of taking severance and redundancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The staff concerned are those who now work in the oil pipeline division of BNOC. No one wanted to be unfair to the staff. Indeed, hon. Members of all parties felt that the service that the staff had given and their proficiency
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
and efficiency entitled them to be treated with the utmost care and sensitivity, following the disruption of their careers as the result of a Government decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That applies as much to the staff working on the pipeline side of BNOC as to those working on the participation agreements and the oil trading side. In fact, there are even more reasons why staff working on the pipeline side should be treated rather better than is proposed. They have had to face more than a period of sudden uncertainty, with the serious disruption of their career prospects as a result of the Minister's out-of-the-blue statement of March 14, basically to abolish BNOC. They have lived under a cloud of uncertainty, at least since mid-1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand—although I cannot find any parliamentary statements, either written or oral, or any other information—that there has been a major review of the functions, structure organisation and management of the Government's pipeline storage system—to which I shall come later. I asked the Library to use its computer to go through all the parliamentary questions and oral and written statements about the Government's pipeline storage system, but no reference to the review was found.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened very carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Could he please relate his remarks to the sittings motion, which is what we are discussing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My suggestion is that we cannot proceed with the sittings motion until the cloud of uncertainty over a number of BNOC staff is removed, because it relates to a clear, categorical assurance given by a Minister on Second Reading. It is not a matter that lends itself to immediate amendment, but there are members of the staff of BNOC whose careers and livelihoods are being jeopardised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the matter does not lend itself to amendment, it is not in the Bill and we cannot consider it. Will the hon. Gentleman relate what he is saying more directly to the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies, Mr. Knox, but it is in the Bill. There are references to the staff in schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If it is in the Bill, the hon. Gentleman can speak to amendments in due course. He cannot speak to the contents of the Bill. We are discussing the sittings motion, and I should be grateful if he would keep to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not agree to a sittings motion or proceed with the detailed discussion of the Bill until this cloud of uncertainty is removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many references in the Bill to the Government's oil and pipelines installation and to staff matters, but by the time we come to discuss the staff matters, the people concerned will already have had to come to a decision about what to do. Will the Minister briefly give us a commitment that BNOC staff will be given the opportunity that I have suggested—either of accepting redundancy or of going across? If so, I shall pass on to my other argument relating to the sittings motion which concerns the structure of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a duty to the staff; many hon. Members have made it clear that they believe that the staff should be treated fairly, and an assurance to that effect was given during the winding-up speech on Second Reading. This is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the first opportunity we have had to debate problems in the Bill that affect the livelihood of staff, and I thought it not unreasonable to raise the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure us that the five or six members of BNOC staff who are facing considerable problems and would prefer to seek their livelihoods elsewhere will be given the chance to do so? I thought that such an assurance had been given by the Under-Secretary of State on Second Reading, but I should like it reaffirmed now. If we do not receive an assurance, I shall raise the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole business of what is happening to the oil pipeline and storage system gives rise to considerable concern. Another reason—I hope that this one will be in order—why we should not proceed with the sittings motion is that a vital part of the Bill concerns the transfer of the functions of the oil pipeline and storage system from the BNOC to the new agency. I have discovered that since the middle of 1983 two major reports on the future management, structure and position of the oil pipeline and storage system have been drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First — and again, I can find no parliamentary reference to this by the Government, although I shall gladly accept correction if I am wrong — PA Management Consultants did a major report for the Government on the command structure and development of the storage and pipeline system. I have seen no copy of that major report, and have been unable to find one in the Library. The pipeline and storage system is an intrinsic part of the Bill and will feature largely in our debates. Therefore, before we go any further, I should like the Minister to give a commitment that he will make a copy of that comprehensive report available to members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the BNOC annual report for 1983 states that management consultants are to review the system's operating efficiency and structure. It occurred to me that that report for 1983 was published on 17 April 1984; yet we are now approaching June 1985 and the 1984 report has still not appeared. It is likely that this matter will be covered in last year's report. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). Our interests do coincide occasionally and I hope that he will further support me in my requests for information before debating the substance of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report that I have mentioned was not the only one that has been drawn up. The PA Management Consultants report was completed in late 1983. At the beginning of 1984, an inter-departmental working party was established to investigate the possibility of privatising the whole Government pipeline and storage system. A major interdepartmental report was undertaken to consider how to privatise a system created for strategic and national security reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only was an inter-departmental working party set up to look into the question of how to privatise the pipeline and storage system, but the notion was that to enhance the system's commercial value, one should close bits of it, dump on the Ministry of Defence the unprofitable parts
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
that would make it less commercial and saleable, and sell the profitable parts to the private sector. That was the basis of the thinking in the working party in 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my knowledge, the House has not had the advantage of what must be an interesting report of the interdepartmental working party's plans to privatise the Government's pipeline and storage system. The Committee has certainly not seen the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pipeline and storage system was created as an act of strategic necessity jut before the second world war. In the Minister's statement on 14 March, he said that the system was important for both defence and civil purposes. Yet the Government were willing to privatise a piece of our strategic supply system. I do not know how much lower one can stoop in selling national assets. To sell assets related to the security of supply is pretty low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Bill is a manifestation of the Government's decision not to proceed with privatisation, at least for the time being. Is so, why? Was it, as I suspect, that the Ministry of Defence, with some appreciation of national strategic needs, vetoed any notion of privatisation? On what basis was the decision taken? Was it taken because the Ministry of Defence told the interdepartmental working party, "We don't believe that this should be privatised."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to study the two major reports—the PA report and the report of the inter-departmental working party, which considered privatising the system. Without an assurance that those reports will be made available, we should not proceed to consider the Bill in detail. A vital part of the Bill involves the whole Government storage system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Knox, took me to task on my point about staffing. I appreciate that I may have strayed out of order and I beg your forgiveness. I hope that my second point was wholly appropriate to our debate on the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I had two issues to raise before approving or rejecting the sittings motion. The second relates to the structure of the Bill. Many moons ago—almost 20 years —before victorious elections interrupted my promising academic career, I was a tutor. I established a course at the LSE on the processes of legislation. The Lord Chancellor's Office partly paid for my salary; I do not think that he would pay for me now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I have got very rusty. I spent four and a half years in the Foreign Office. It does not produce much legislation—only one-clause independence Bills. I recommend that the Minister of State to move to the Foreign Office, as one does not end up sitting in Committees day and night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talked about the question of legislation when we debated the parent of the Bill—a dubious parent—the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very concerned about the whole structure of the Bill. One aspect that I hammered at least into myself—I hope that I taught it to my students properly—was the difference between a section and a schedule. A section is a substantive clause, but a schedule fulfils a different purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we seek procedural clarification we turn immediately to our bible, "Erskine May". I am glad that copies are available in the Committee. It gives the definition of a clause and of a schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the end of many bills there is found a set of schedules which contain matters of detail dependent on the provisions of the bill. A schedule is a part of the bill and is dependent on one or more of the preceding clauses, by means of which the provisions of the schedule are carried into effect."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, there is a clear distinction between a section and a schedule. A section or clause is a substantive piece of legislation, but a schedule, as "Erskine May" says, is supposed to contain
	<br><blockquote><p>"matters of detail dependent on the provisions of the bill."</p></blockquote>
Let us consider whether the structure of the Bill conforms with the definition laid down in "Erskine May". Schedule 3 contains not matters of detail, but all the grant-making and subsidising powers of the Secretary of State, and all the borrowing and financial provisions for the agency. All those provisions are contained in a schedule at the back of the Bill. By any definiton those are not just
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"matters of detail dependent on the provisions of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
The main provision, or the substantive provision relating to finance, is the pathetic little subsection (3) in clause 5. That is the sole provision which triggers the whole borrowing, grant-making, subsidising and loan-making powers provided in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge the idea that, by any stretch of the imagination, the definition in "Erskine May" is being met in this structurally defective Bill. Draftsmanship seems to have declined since my day. Certainly, we would not expect such a Bill to contain all the borrowing or rule-making powers in one small subsection and have the rest of the them tucked away in a schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to start off perfectly amicably in Committee, I refer to the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975 which provided for the establishment of BNOC. The corporation's borrowing powers are contained in section 6, not in a schedule, because no schedule applies to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. As I understand it, his was a supportive intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will note that schedule 2 is headed "Provisions Supplementary to Section 3". Does the hon. Gentleman agree that supplementary suggests that the provisions are not necessarily dependent on section 3, but add to it and might have been more useful as sections in their own right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another aspect of the Bill on which I had not concentrated. I had focused on what I believed to be a more serious and fundamental aspect. I understand how we can define a schedule, according to "Erskine May", as supplementing a main section. But I do not see how we can describe schedule 3 as
	<br><blockquote><p>"matters of detail dependent on the provisions of the bill."</p></blockquote>
when it is preceded only by section 5(3), which contains a mere one and a half lines and simply refers us to the schedule. That does not fall within the distinction between a section and a schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 appears to be the most appropriate, if dubious parent for the Bill—if indeed it can be said to have one at all. There are some veterans of that Bill in Committee today. Let us look at what the Government and the draftsmen properly did with the provisions in the 1982 Bill equivalent to those now tucked away in schedule 3 of the present Bill. The subject of section 4 of the 1982 Act, entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"New financial structure of Oil Corporation",</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
was not tucked away in a schedule. The subject of section 5, entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments by Oil Corporation to Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
was dealt with in that section, not in a schedule, as were the subjects of section 6, entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Grants by Secretary of State to Oil Corporation",</p></blockquote>
and section 7, entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Borrowing powers etc. of Oil Corporation".</p></blockquote>
All four major sections are in a substantive part of the main Bill, backed up by appropriate supplementary schedules providing more detail on specific points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything that has been tucked away in schedule 3 of this Bill was correctly presented in substantive sections in the parent Act of 1982. We have a right to challenge the extraordinary structure of the Bill and to seek an explanation for it. I am not making a party point, but a perfectly proper, legislative and structural point and I hope that Conservative Members will support me in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believed that one of the fundamental purposes of the House was the scrutiny of finance. We should be squeamish — and rightly so — about giving the Government powers to borrow, lend or give grants without making a substantive provision in the Bill. That is not fulfilled by putting all those powers and responsibilities into a schedule, rather than making them part of the body of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very power that led to our having to grant the extraordinary estimates that led to the Select Committee's investigations and reports—the power that gave rise to £65 million-worth of subsidies and grants to BNOC at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year—was granted to the Secretary of State by section 6 of the Oil and Gas Act 1982. If we accept the structure of this Bill, that power, which has been used to the tune of £65 million during the past 12 months, will be tucked away at the back of schedule 3. We object to that. It is not only bad draftsmanship; the Bill is structurally defective. The Government should not push the provision away and pretend that it is nothing but a detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies will he explain the structure of the Bill? We should not start to discuss the Bill in detail without a proper explanation of this curious method of legislation. Do the Government feel that it is the best way to get the Bill through?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sat on the Cabinet committee that sees legislation through. I know that if a Bill is produced late in the Session and the Department is in a hurry to get it through, as is the case with this Bill, the Minister goes to the legislative committee and says, "This is a very small Bill. It is only a five-clause Bill, it won't take much time, and won't bother the House much. Look at it—there are only five clauses and one is explanatory." I remember that the legislative committee rarely bothered to look at the schedules of a Bill. If a Department wants to get a Bill through late in the Session it makes it look as small as possible, by tucking everything that matters into a schedule. That thought occurred to me when I was wondering about how the structure of the Bill had been devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have every right to object and to seek, before we start to discuss the Bill in detail, a proper explanation of its extraordinary structure. If "Erskine May" is right, there is no way in which schedule 3 should be in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The problem is worse confounded: I can think of no precedents for a Minister introducing a Bill on Second Reading failing to mention once the financial provisions of the Bill—the powers to borrow, and to make grants and loans. Where in the Minister's speech, or in the windup by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, were the financial issues—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is beginning to wander away from the sittings motion again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never like to wander, Mr. Knox, and I certainly did not intend to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why I have spoken in such detail on the sittings motion is that neither Minister gave any explanation on Second Reading of the borrowing powers in the Bill. When the Parliamentary Under-Secretary was asked in an intervention to do so, he said that he would if he had time. He succeeded in never having time, so we have never had any explanation of why the agency should have an £80 million borrowing power tucked away in schedule 3. The Secretary of State will be able to make grants to the agency, to take money from it and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1982 Act, similar provisions were contained in substantive clauses. I believe that it is improper —although not illegal—sloppy and an insult to the House and the Committee to stick such important powers away in what is meant to be a detailed supplementary schedule to a major substantive provision, which itself is nothing more than a one and a half line subsection to another clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask the Minister to clarify those two aspects of the - Bill, to explain its structure and to give some reassurance to the staff of the BNOC, before I can agree to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reply to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). I agree that they are substantial questions. Whether the hon. Gentleman wandered and whether what he said was relevant to a sittings motion is not, of course, for me to judge, although I may have my views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should certainly apologise to the hon. Gentleman and to the Committee if there were any confusion about the future of the staff affected, by the decision to wind up the BNOC as I agree that we would not want confusion on such an important matter. I assure the Committee that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in no way sought to mislead the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider both redundancy pay and the position of existing staff who will be offered continuing employment and for whom the question of redundancy pay will not arise. Any reasonable person would not consider it right to give redundancy pay to staff who are offered continuing employment. There will be no question of compulsory transfer to the new agency because people will have the free choice of resigning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a choice!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will have the choice if they wish to take it. If staff believe that the position offered to them in the new agency is not reasonably comparable with their existing post, they may have a claim to statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
compensation. However, it makes no sense generally to offer the choice of continuing employment or redundancy pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what you, Mr. Knox, have said, I shall not stray too much. We can use our ingenuity to discuss these matters later, possibly on schedule 1. People will note what the Minister has said, but we are discussing only four or five young people working in BNOC. Althouh they work in the pipelines division, they were employed by BNOC as a whole, which is an oil company. The new agency will be a truncated and different type of organisation in which their career prospects would be blighted. As only four or five people are involved would it not be a reasonable act of generosity to offer the same redundancy terms as are being offered to other corporation staff? The older staff who know a lot about pipeline work may wish to transfer to the agency, but I understand that there are four or five younger members of staff who would wish to take redundancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fundamental difference between those whose jobs will end and those being offered continuing employment. If the employment is regarded as not continuing, procedures are available. That is the proper and reasonable way to handle that. I hope that what I have said this morning will clarify the matter. It would be the worst thing of all to have confusion and uncertainty, and I welcome the opportunity provided by the hon. Gentleman to clarify the position, although it is clear from his intervention that my response did not wholly satisfy him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point concerned the future operation of the pipelines system and recent discussions about its organisation. He was correct to say that there has been a report, which the Government are considering, on the pipelines and storage system. It covered both the operating efficiency of the various agents whom the Government employ to manage the system as a whole, and the command structure. It contains much information that is commercially confidential, and is a private report to the Secretary of State. Moreover, it involves other sensitive issues—for instance, from the Ministry of Defence—which have to be safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Government's decision that the new Oil and Pipelines Agency should take over the BNOC's function as the management agency for the Government's pipelines and storage system, we shall not pursue the possibility of privatising the system. I imagine that the hon. Gentleman will smile at that and say, "On the one hand … and on the other". I cannot, of course, commit future Governments, so I shall have to use the hon. Gentleman's phrase "for the time being", because it is obvious that a Government may wish to consider that possibility at some future date. However, I hope that I have made the present position clear, and that there is no intention to pursue that possibility, although clearly, as I said, I cannot give a commitment for ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has been extremely helpful. Did the report recommend the privatisation of the system? I understand that he has negatived the principle of privatisation, but did the report recommend that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to rest with what I said a moment ago. I cannot at the same time say that the report is commercially confidential and give that information. I must, therefore, as my hon. Friend to rest on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not even the hon. Member for Befordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) should rest on that; certainly we shall not. Nothing commercially confidential is involved in answering a simple question or in telling us whether the report concluded that privatisation was a feasible, preferable or desirable option. Only some Conservative Members would ever consider the possibility of privatising something as important as the strategic needs of this country. Can the Minister at least tell us whether the PA report recommended that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unhelpful. I can only say that the report came up with a number of options. The Government were left to take the decision on those options, and one of the options was privatisation. It was an option. I may not have satisfied the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), but I hope that I have protected my rear on the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third point concerned the structure of the Bill. I am glad that he did not try—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister continues, will he answer the question put to him in an intervention by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet)? Given that last year BNOC' s annual report was published in April, why has this year's report not yet been published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The publication of the report is a matter for BNOC. Without notice, I cannot say exactly, when it will be published, but it should be very soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney did not claim that we had done anything illegal in choosing this structure for the Bill. Of course we hve not. I hope that no Government would seek to do anything illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the intervention of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) and the speech of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, I must emphasise that the schedules have just the same legal force as the rest of the Bill. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland has much greater experience of legal matters than I and he will know that provisions carry the same legal force whether they are in the main body of a Bill or in the schedules to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is right that one can approach the structure of Bills in various ways. In some cases—as in the one that he mentioned — most of the detailed provisions, financial or otherwise, are contained in the main body of the Bill. However, one can equally take the course that we have chosen. Irrespective of whether one judges that the right choice has been made, there are precedents for both courses. The hon. Gentleman cited a precedent to illustrate his case, and I shall be happy to cite precedents for the structure that we have chosen. I have endeavoured to choose examples that may be of interest to the hon. Gentleman. Section 12 of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 deals with a body of interest to the hon. Gentleman—the Land Authority for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invented it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why—anticipating, as I always do, the point that the hon. Gentleman would raise — I chose that example. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is more conversant with the details of the Act than I am. Schedule 21 sets out the authority's borrowing
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
powers and includes provisions on treasury guarantees, accounts and audit, the payment of surpluses to the Secretary of State, annual reports, the provision of information and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I accept that there are two ways of proceeding. There are precedents for both, and it is a matter of judgment which one adopts. But our choice in no way limits the legal power of the Bill—I am sure that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland would confirm that — or, indeed, the opportunities for the House and the Committee to discuss its provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking also of the Industry Act 1975. I shall have to check the reference that the Minister has kindly given me. As I understand it, the 1980 Act simply reaffirmed the existence of the Land Authority for Wales. The organisation was established not by the 1980 Act but by the Community Land Act 1975. I remember working on the Welsh provisions of that Act as Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I recollect—I should like to check this—the 1980 Act simply reaffirmed an existing authority. Whereas in this Bill we are creating a new agency with new powers. Therefore, the precedent that the Minister picked may not be entirely appropriate. I cannot recall how we proceeded with the Community Land Act, but I shall find out before the next sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will do that, and I may try to find out a little more, too. But as I said, it is a matter of judgment and one could take either route. The Government have made their choice and as in so many debates of this kind one can always go on quoting precedents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedules have full legal effect. The structure does not affect the application of. the Bill or the Government's intentions in the Bill. Secondly, and more important, it does not limit the Committee's opportunity to debate the Bill properly. I accept what the hon. Gentleman has said, but his was an option that we did not choose to take. However, I hope that he will join me and the Committee in dealing with the Bill as it is drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the usual affable and helpful manner in which the Minister replied, even though he leaves us still dissatisfied — a pattern which will doubtless be repeated as we debate the Bill in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised three issues during our debate on the sittings motion. Opposition Members are not satisfied on the first, but with a little ingenuity it can be raised without straying out of order on schedule 1, or somewhere else in the Bill. If it is agreed to take clause 1 and schedule 1 together, we may have an earlier rather than a later opportunity to discuss the BNOC staff. However, I give the Minister notice that I am not satisfied and shall return to the matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have an opportunity to cross-examine the Minister and find out the basis of the agency and its financial structure when we debate schedule 3 with clause 5(3). I think that my powder is still dry on the substantive issues and in the light of that I shall not oppose the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am distressed to find that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has no supporters from his party. I am a considerate man. I recommend that to relieve the hon. Gentleman's voice we should have an adjournment of 10 minutes so that he can re-equip and then press ahead with greater resonance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) seems to have a strong voice from what I have heard so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply touched by the solicitude and loving care of the hon.

Member for his suggestion, but he has already invoked divine intervention because my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) has arrived to support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will be both diligent and timely. I must explain to my hon. Friend that the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North inquired about my health because it seemed that I would be on my own. However, I knew that reinforcements were literally flying into the Committee. I appreciate the suggestion of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North but I do not need an adjournment yet. I am fit, well and willing and able to continue with my usual sparcity of words to discuss the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The amendments aim to discover and establish the agency's character. What sort of animal will it be? Will it be an independent, autonomous organisation or just an annexe of the Department of Energy? The character of the chairman and members of the board is not just a pernickety detail but a substantial question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to establish the type of person who will chair the agency and serve on it. The choice of a chairman often says much about his organisation. Here, it will tell us whether the agency is to be a mere appendage — an extension of the Department of Energy — or whether it will have some independence and a character and quality of its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 seeks to delete "part-time". A part-time chairman often means a part-time organisation. That is not always true and I do not deny that there are some excellent part-time chairmen. However, a part-time chairman would establish the agency as a rather small adjunct of the Department of Energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are not adamant about the appointment, but we wish to explore ministerial thinking about it. I believe that the Minister has not yet announced the appointment of a chairman, and we wished to make our suggestions as soon as possible about the type of person who should fill the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is in no way meant to be insulting, derogatory, or a reflection on the staff at the Department of Energy. If the position were filled by a retired civil servant who had served at the Department of Energy, or one who still worked there, we would suspect that the plan was for the Department of Energy to keep its claws firmly on the agency. A person who had stalked the corners of Whitehall and who was on good terms with staff at the Department of Energy or the Whitehall Civil Service, would not make the agency feel independent with its own remit and its own role, rather than just an extension of Government. For those reasons, we suggest that the chairman should not be an official of the Department of Energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 is a variation on that theme. It seeks to ensure that the chairman is not a serving or retired civil servant. Again, that is no reflection on people of excellent ability and quality. It is not meant as a jibe about the Lord Crohams of this world. We have a jealous feeling that the agency must be independent and have a life and character of its own. It should not be tied too closely to Whitehall and the Civil Service. The chairman should not be a Whitehall mandarin or ex-Whitehall mandarin, but someone new, imaginative and with a different perception of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 seeks one other qualification on the character of the chairman. He should not be an employee or director of a major oil company. It is our objective to enhance the agency. As I said rather cacophonously on Second Reading, we shall try to beef up the agency. If the chairman had worked in a major oil company the agency could have character and substance. However, we fear that it could also become a pathetic, stripped-down substitute for an effective and professional British National Oil Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought long and hard about whether to table the amendment, and we decided to go ahead because we do not want the agency to be tied in too closely with the major oil companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
We see the agency as an independent organisation, fulfilling a function in securing our oil supply and we hope to amend the Bill to give the agency many useful functions in the development of oil trade. There is, therefore, a strong case for having a chairman who is not part of the outside oil empire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Stevens 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the wording of the amendment would exclude anyone who has been involved in the oil industry? Anyone who has been "an employee or director" of an oil company would be discounted, and we might exclude a number of people with a contribution to make who have not actually been in charge of the oil industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. We thought hard about the amendment, and if its drafting fails to achieve the end we seek, I am more than willing to look at it again and come back later with a variation. The sting of the amemdment is in its last three or four words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the major oil companies".</p></blockquote>
It does not exclude everyone who has worked in the oil industry. I was about to make that point. I should like to see the agency being the friend of the smaller British North sea oil companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens) was present on Second Reading, but I am sure that he will have read the report. One of the arguments that I tried to make in that debate was that the abolition of BNOC would weaken and not strengthen the smaller, independent companies. BNOC has played an important role in helping the smaller companies to get their oil to market. It has helped in collecting, packaging and selling the small quantities of oil produced by those companies which did not want to set up elaborate oil trading departments or to be forced by the power and pressure of the big boys to sell their oil to the major companies. Those small companies felt that they would not get the best deal by fitting in with Shell, BP or Esso.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an argument to which we shall return, and I hope that I shall be able to carry some Conservative Members with me on our amendments to clause 2 which covers the general functions of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the agency could be the friend of the independent British North sea companies. My experience has not been of work in the industry, but for a number of years, I have surveyed it and monitored it under three Secretaries of State for Energy. There are great differences of attitude between the Mr. Raismans of the world, sitting on the top of enormous piles, and the people running Premier and Goal Petroleum and those who make up Brindex, the British independent oil companies organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always had a keen desire to argue in the House the case for the small independent oil companies. However, commercial pressure, which the Bill is adding to, is growing and will swallow, rather than create, young and new enterprises. The merger mania in the City is fantastic, and the North sea oil industry is party to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put that argument on clause 2, but the purpose of our amendment to clause 1, although it may be too sweeping, is to seek a chairman with a real feeling for the small guy, the small oil company. He must understand the supportive role that the new agency could play in helping
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the independent oil companies of the North sea. By destroying BNOC, the Bill would pull away one of the props from the smaller, independent sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the amendment might be too widely drafted and might try to catch too many in our net, the reason is that we are seeking someone who is not from the major oil world, who will have a feel for the subject, and who will know what it is like to be in the lonely, smaller and colder world of the small oil company. Later, especially on clause 2, we hope that the Minister will agree with us in giving the agency a function and role. We seek to establish a principle, and to introduce a paving amendment for some of our thoughts on clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these amendments we seek to establish that the chairman of the new agency should not be of a certain character or certain type. That still leaves an enormous range of opportunity. However, these exclusions seek to establish the sort of person we think will shape the character of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall be able to flush out a better understanding and feeling from the Minister, and that he will share with us his thoughts about what sort of person the Government are looking for and whether they have succeeded in recruiting someone. I hope that he will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, Mr. Knox, I should apologise for coming late. I can relate the reasons for my tardy arrival to one of our amendments. I have listened with great attention to my hon. Friend in the 22 minutes that I have been present, and I have been remarkably disappointed with the reaction. My hon. Friend has demonstrated a real flexibility, and a generosity of spirit and approach. He was prepared to accept interventions and I hoped that Conservative Members would intervene to show that they appreciated his generosity and flexibility, and that they would be forthcoming with information. It is too soon for the Minister to reply, but I hope that he will adopt the same sort of constructive approach as my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned that we had seriously considered the amendments. He has given some reasons for amendment No. 3, but my experience this morning has provided another which is relevant and topical. I suspect that some staff in the Department of Energy have at some time been involved in the Department of Transport. It took me one hour and 21 minutes to drive in from Heathrow airport this morning, so no one who has held any responsibility for transport should be considered for any appointment. The trip was a scandalous experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had every confidence that my hon. Friend would be able to move the amendments tabled in our names, but I was worried that the weather, which has been extremely changeable recently, might have left him with a cold. One or two of my friends have colds that have turned into laryngitis—hence my anxiety as I found myself stuck on motorways, at traffic lights, at roadworks and at roadblocks. I thought to myself that anyone who has had anything to do with transport and now works in the Department of Energy should not be given this particular job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend, I hope that we are not being unkind to people who may be dedicated public servants; but even the most dedicated public servant is imperfect, and that is certainly true of those who are responsible for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the transport system between Heathrow airport and Westminster. They should therefore not be considered for the post, and as we cannot identify them, the amendment is all the more justified—as is amendment No. 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has already delivered a formidable defence of amendment No. 5 in answer to the intervention of the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens). I know that the Government are keen on small businesses. A whole collection of Ministers seem to bear responsibility for minor companies. Indeed, the Government are so attached to small businesses that they have been doing their best for five years to make big businesses small. Hosts of large or middle-sized companies have become small businesses. In view of the Government's belief that small is beautiful, a belief to which every Minister with economic responsibilities — including, perhaps, the Minister present today—has been diligently committed, I should have thought that the amendment would seem fairly attractive to them. The Government's record of making big and middle-sized companies tiny is one of real achievement, so I would have expected my hon. Friend's point to fall on receptive ears. I would have expected the Minister to agree that the minor oil companies were in some difficulty, or were at least being imperilled by the changes brought about by this and other Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will heed the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend and make a gesture to people who, although they are often, regrettably, imbued with the profit motive, consider that there is a place for new businesses to grow offshore. That relates to the point that the Minister made in Texas. I know that he was concerned with the need to get engineering and technological orders, but minor oil companies, properly served and encouraged, are more likely to buy British than are some of the international majors that perhaps attract the favour and attention of one or two Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not help the minor oil companies, and the Minister could do something to redress the balance by accepting our point. It has much to commend it on the grounds of logic, and to accept it would be an especially appropriate gesture at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue that I wish to address is the deletion of the words "part-time". Conservative Members who have long experience of the matter, such as the hon. Members for Reading, West (Mr. Durant) and for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet), will know that, for many years, people serving on public bodies have given enormous and dedicated service, although their appointments have been part time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like me, the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant) — I shall not try to trick him into speaking, because I know the limitation; I shall be quite content if he nods his head in affirmation—has a considerable interest in inland waterways. For a long time, Sir Frank Price was chairman of the British Waterways Board, and he devoted a great deal of enthusiasm and energy to his task. I believe that his appointment was part-time. I think, too, of Lord John-Mackie, who was part-time chairman of the Forestry Commission. He gave full-time attention and concern to that organisation, and a life-time's interest was reflected in his commitment to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the present chairman of the Nature Conservancy Council. I confess that I have not sought his permission to refer to his role, but I know that he has put
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
an enormous effort into his responsibilities. Indeed, I am sure that all of us can think of people who serve in public agencies and committees supposedly on a part-time basis, but devote full-time energy and enthusiasm to their roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may have been fair for a Labour Government to make those appointments, but it is a bit much for a Government who are committed to market forces and who worship Mammon more than any Government have done in modern times, certainly in the past 30 or 40 years, to expect certain people to devote their lives, enthusiasm and energy part time. The practice should stop. It is wrong for the Government to follow monetarist policies and to extol free collective bargaining, with devil take the hindmost, while expecting other people to conduct themselves with a patriotism and selflessness that Conservative Members would never practise — at least, if they remain in the fashion of service to the economic theories espoused by their present leaders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment is timely, relevant and consistent. If Conservative Members are consistent and wish to be relevant to the economic and political faith that they espouse, they will agree that they cannot possibly reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two other reasons for the amendment, one of which needs careful attention—the present unemployment. I make the point in another amendment that unemployment is not evenly spread through the country. Indeed, some Conservative Members who represent constituencies south of a line between the Wash and Bristol are not as exposed to unemployment as are other Conservative members of the Committee. The Minister, representing a Scottish constituency, will share the concern that goes across party boundaries in Scotland. I know, too, that the hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Watson), being a fellow Yorkshire Member, is well aware of the dreadful unemployment in my county, although in south Yorkshire it is much worse than in the part of the county that he so diligently represents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of recent opinion polls, does the hon. Gentleman agree that Conservative Members representing constituencies south of a line from the Severn to the Wash may now be concentrating on their own unemployment? A full-time job might be just what they are looking for after the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but may I make a further point about the matter so properly raised by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace)? If Conservative Members do not vote for some of our amendments, they will not get any jobs from the incoming Labour Government when the opinion polls become a reality. [Interruption.] I apologise if that sounds overbearing and threatening. Perhaps I am being too aggressive, because I am not making a direct threat. Let me say instead that there would be some reluctance, and it would be a fairly reasonable, proper and responsible reluctance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members are not prepared even to consider the value of our amendment, they will not be able to justify such appointments when, as the hon. Gentleman reminded me, they all lose their seats at the next election. They would want full-time jobs, not part-time jobs, and it would be in their interest for part-time jobs to be removed. However, that is not the only reason. We should not reward patriotism, endeavour and energy badly, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
we should recognise service. Many chairmen of public bodies have suggested that full-time service, or more than full-time service, should be properly rewarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the relevant question of unemployment. If one person is appointed to that post it will not make much difference to the national unemployment statistics. As your constituency, Mr. Knox, is not far from some of the industrial areas that are affected so badly, you will understand my meaning. I worked out that I spent at least eight hours for every job that I helped to create in my constituency in the past two years. It would be utterly unreasonable for me to speak for eight hours on this amendment, but if I have to spend eight hours to find one job in my constituency—parts of which have a 30 per cent. unemployment rate or more, and the rate is rising rapidly—it is clear that I value every job. I hope the Minister values every job, and that he realises that he has an opportunity to help. It may be only one full-time job, but one full-time job is better than half a job, or no job at all. He can assist his right hon. Friends in the Department of Employment by accepting amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a full-time job were given to someone on the unemployment register in the constituency of the hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, or in the Minister's own constituency, I would not see that as an improper action —nor, I hope, would my hon. Friends. If the Minister has a suitable unemployed person in his constituency, that person should be appointed, rather than someone from an area where unemployment is still in single figures—and there are a few. I hope that any full-time appointment is made from the register in areas of high unemployment, such as the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, my constituency, or the other two constituencies in the metropolitan borough of Rotherham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another reason why a retired or serving civil servant should not be appointed. Many of the civil servants in my constituency are first-class people. However, because they have spent their lives diligently serving in the Department of Health and Social Security, the Department of Employment, or in jobcentres, they have not acquired the relevant skills, qualifications or experience to fill that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The civil servants who have the relevant skill and experience come from areas where unemployment may be in single figures, and their appointment would not help to create and establish national benefit. The Minister should bear that in mind, because if he wished to appoint a civil servant, he would have to appoint someone from within 30 or 40 miles of London, or perhaps from within a few miles of Aberdeen or one of the other areas of Scotland where the off-shore industry has developed rapidly. But those areas are among the few areas that have not, yet — I use the word "yet" advisedly — experienced the appalling effects that my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and I have witnessed in our constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already allowed the hon. Gentleman to stray rather beyond the terms of the amendments. I do not think that they lend themselves to a general discussion of the problem of unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. I was certainly not seeking to engage in a general debate on unemployment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I thought that I was relating my remarks to the reduction of unemployment by the appointment of a full-time chairman of the agency. I have certainly not trespassed deliberately, and I hope that I shall always apologise if I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent a long time on the amendments. I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to reply yet; he may have anticipated that those of his hon. Friends who have substantial experience of the matter would wish to give the Committee the benefit of their wisdom. The Minister might well have preferred a little more time in which to deliberate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me summarise my principal arguments on amendment No. 2. I have said a great deal about the distinction between full-time and part-time appointments because it is very important. The Minister has been in the House for a long time and knows the Scotland scene very well. He will know that there are numerous examples of part-time appointments. The present chairman of the Forestry Commission, who I believe is a compatriot of the Minister, occupies a part-time post. Because the Minister cares for the environment, he may have met the chairman of the Nature Conservancy Council. He will certainly have met the present chairman of the National Coal Board. I am not suggesting that the chairman of the new agency should be paid the same salary as the chairman of the NCB, although I reckon that he is virtually part time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking for a full-time appointment for full-time service. We do not suggest that someone should be given a part-time job and treated as if they were full time. We are talking about people who will be fully committed and who will not work in a negligent or half-hearted manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the haste of my journey to the House this morning, I forgot to mention another reason for my view. I suspect that the staff of BNOC feel profound anxiety and perhaps frustration at the moment. A mood of uncertainty will certainly prevail, because the staff employed by BNOC will be greatly reduced as a result of the Government's measures. The agency will probably take only a very small proportion—perhaps the Minister will go into detail on that—of the total staff. That inevitably will mean that many people, currently working for BNOC will feel serious anxiety and uncertainty. Against a background of high unemployment, and in view of the threats to the minor oil companies that I have already mentioned, that anxiety and uncertainty should be allayed as soon as possible. The new chairman's principal task may well be to try to effect the transition without adding to the burden of human misery, wretchedness and sorrow. I trust that the Minister realises that his action means that many BNOC staff will lose their jobs. He may be optimistic and think that, as many will have acquired experience, skills and qualifications and will have demonstrated their abilities, they will find other relevant occupation. But they do not know that. They are insecure. They look at the unemployment figures and the other 750,000 who have no jobs but do not appear in the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it may be sensitive and intelligent for the Minister to ensure that the new chairman is full time so that he can devote several days a week to assisting those who have to go as a result of this dreadful measure and those who may feel that as the agency does not appear to have a long life ahead of it, their future is not secure. If the Government survive a general election in 1988 they may live longer than the agency; Conservative Members may have their own views about that. The threat of termination of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
agency's existence means that BNOC staff must be anxious. I have not spoken to them about it, but anyone threatened with the sack today is bound to be worried. Conservative Members have become rather worried during the past year or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is wandering again. The position of hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. I did not mean to go down that road, but the hon. Gentleman's intervention took me along a path that I should not have trodden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BNOC' s present employees are suffering anxiety, stress and uncertainty. They do not know whether they will be retained, or whether they will be offered temporary jobs with the agency or offered redundancy. The chairman must be full time. That has given me an idea for another amendment —I do not know whether there is time to table it—to seek to ensure that an essential qualification for the chairman or members of the board is expertise in, and understanding of, human and industrial relationships. If that will be the chairman's principal function in his first six months, he should not be part time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under amendment No. 8 we shall have the opportunity to make sure that a member of the board has industrial relations experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My anxiety is that, of all our amendments, that may be the most unacceptable to the Government. It may infuriate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. However accurate the hon. Gentleman's observation may be, we are not discussing that amendment now. If he moves along, we shall come to it quite quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether we shall come to it quickly because we have amendments Nos. 6 and 7 to consider before we reach amendment No. 8. I hope that you will accept, Mr. Knox, that I was led astray by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) and that I am now being led astray by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands). It would have been discourteous not to respond, and I have tried to do so as succinctly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not prepared to consider our argument that the chairman should be full time, it will be an act of insensitivity and will add to the anxiety among the staff of BNOC. They would take it very badly indeed. If he does not accept our amendment, the Minister will compound the anxiety and frustration. We may not have helped because our amendment has given the Minister the opportunity to act unintelligently and insensitively, although I do not think that he would wish to act in that way. I trust that he will respond helpfully to this serious amendment. It has not been tabled merely to give us something to talk about. We believe that the chairman will have a major part to play in industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the amendments, especially amendment No. 2. Every amendment in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
group has merit and I trust that he will give each one generous, sensitive and intelligent consideration. That would help to lessen the anxiety of BNOC employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much left to say after the contributions of the hon. Members for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) and for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). I apologise if I led the hon. Member for Wentworth astray. I am sure that he will not take offence if I say that he was very easily and willingly led.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of the debate, I was somewhat agnostic about amendment No. 2, but I have considered the matter, particularly the point made by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that it is intended to enhance the status of the agency, and I think that it would be helpful if the appointment were full time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that redundancy is unlikely to be offered to members of staff who do not take up the offer of transfer to the agency. Most of us hope that the transfer proposition will be attractive, with reassurance on career prospects. If the agency has a full-time chairman and is not seen as a second-rate Government or public body, it will do a lot to improve staff morale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 4, if the agency is to enjoy some status and independence of government, the appointment of its chairman should not be seen as an alternative to a KCMG or GCMG or a way of putting a civil servant out to grass. The chairman should be a person with expertise in the oil industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My immediate reaction to amendment No. 5 was similar to that of the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens). If we exclude people with close knowledge of the industry, how shall we find someone with the necessary expertise? It is not unreasonable to expect the agency's functions to be similar to those set out in clause 2, and that would involve detailed knowledge of the industry, participation agreements, and so on. A chairman with expertise would be very welcome.

I take the point of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney about the role that the agency could fill in assisting small oil companies. BNOC has performed a useful marketing role for the small oil companies, and its abolition could leave them without that security and protection. We hope that an incoming chairman will pay attention to their needs. The most important thing is to get the right person for the job. If that person has been an employee of a major oil company, but is none the less the right person for the job and has useful expertise, he should not be disqualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was intrigued because the hon. Gentleman seemed to support the idea that small is beautiful, although there is no evidence of such support in the hon. Gentleman's amendments or in his speech on Second Reading. I would have expected him to welcome the general thrust of Government policies — first, in placing Britoil on its own and making it independent and, secondly, in making BNOC into the smaller Oil and Pipelines Agency. We seem to be going down the route that the hon. Gentleman advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I detected no great welcome when Enterprise Oil was established, despite the joy and welcome of the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) for small, independent oil companies. There is a slight element of inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Wentworth that I am not aware that the Department of Energy contains any staff who work at the Department of Transport. However I shall look into his question further. If it does, I shall have to reconsider the appointment carefully in view of the hon. Member's view of people in the Department of Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful debate. As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said, the amendments are designed to probe the Government's intentions on the chairman's role and the board's structure and even influence the choice of chairman designate. Nothing has changed since Second Reading. We have not yet appointed a chairman designate, but I repeat my assurance that we shall do so as soon as we can. When making the appointment, I shall bear in mind what has been said this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is implicit in all the remarks that have been made, especially those of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), that we attract to the board people with the best abilities to perform their duties. I appreciate that the amendments contain an element of probing, but restricting the kind of person who can be appointed as chairman or to the board reduces our flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flexibility is desirable. Making a lot of restrictions can limit the field enormously. It can deny the agency the opportunity to obtain the services of someone suitable because of his background or because of the time that he can devote to the agency, so such limitations may not be in the agency's best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When setting up any important public body—not just the Oil and Pipelines Agency—it is essential to retain maximum flexibility to obtain the services of the best people available to perform the functions of the body on which they are serving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the amendments in order. The question whether the chairman should be full time or part time is subject to the risk of reducing flexibility. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney made great play of how long he had been following the energy scene. I am sure that he followed the scene even when he had responsibilities for other matters. But I must say that it is interesting to note that the Labour Government made no stipulation in the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 that the chairmanship of BNOC should be a full-time appointment. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman has paid tribute to the services that Lord Croham has given to BNOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Croham has performed his duty on a part-time basis successfully and with distinction over the past two
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
and a half years. I note that the hon. Gentleman did not criticise the leadership of BNOC under Lord Croham's part-time chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dispute any suggestion that the chairman needs to be full time in order to be fully committed to the work of the agency. The hon. Member for Wentworth referred to some of the numerous bodies, such as the regional water authorities, the National Bus Company and the Civil Aviation Authority, that have a part-time chairman and a full-time chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisage that pattern for the agency because it offers the advantage of flexibility and because it will allow us the opportunity to obtain a person of the highest calibre, but who would not be interested in a full-time appointment. We are talking about a relatively small agency with a limited number of functions. I genuinely believe that the possibility of appointing a candidate of the appropriate calibre will be enhanced if we seek to appoint one on a part-time basis—as we intend to do—rather than on a full-time basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 deals with the chairman's background and recommends that a retired or serving civil servant should not be appointed to the post. I find the remarks of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney paradoxical, because in 1975 the Labour Government provided for two civil servants to be official members of BNOC. The hon. Gentleman's amendment contradicts the view of the Labour Government of which he was a member and I am interested to know why he has changed his opinion. By contrast, the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act, which I believe was opposed by the Labour party, removed the need for those two civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been fortunate in obtaining for such bodies as the agency a high standard of public servants with a high standard of integrity. If we accept the amendments, which will narrow the background from which we can draw candidates, our choice will be severely limited. Experience has shown that a wide choice produces people of high integrity whose first priority is to protect the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it better not to restrict the choice by automatically disqualifying a civil servant from being chairman of the agency. Other bodies have been chaired by distinguished former civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would disqualify those with oil industry experience. That is paradoxical: the Opposition say that they do not want a chairman with an oil industry background, although the amendment is qualified to exclude only those from large companies. However, they would be prepared to see a chairman from a small company. First, I refute entirely the suggestion of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that the Bill removes a prop from the independent small oil companies. Nothing in the Bill does that, a subject which we shall debate later. Under other Government measures, it will be up to the small companies to decide what role they carve out for themselves, but in many ways over recent years the Government have given the small independent companies the opportunity to grow and prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention now only the way that the licensing system has been used—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is suggested by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that the auction system is a major part of the licensing process. The hon. Gentleman should wait to hear the result of the ninth

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
round which will be announced this afternoon. He may then be more careful about jumping to conclusions a little too quickly, as he does on some occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say particularly to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, that we are looking for someone of high integrity who will perform his function objectively, which is surely the job of the chairman of a public body. The moment that one narrows the choice, as the amendment suggests, to a small company background, one will almost be charging the chairman to act partially in the interests of one section of the industry which the agency is to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find amendment No. 5 more contradictory than amendments Nos. 3 and 4. It would remove one part of the industry as a possible source of recruitment and enhance the other, and that implies partiality in the performance of the agency towards one section of the industry. I do not find that to be either in the best public interest or likely to achieve the purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I understand the probing nature of the amendments, but I think that they are wrong in principle. If we want the best quality and calibre of chairman, we must retain flexibility. There are also practical arguments why the three amendments would not allow the agency to perform in the best possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my reply has given the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney some idea of the calibre of chairman we seek and the pattern we shall follow in appointing him. He may not like my answer, but I hope that it has helped him to understand our purpose. No appointment has been made, but I shall reflect on what hon. Members have said, although I certainly cannot give them much encouragement that we shall adopt the ideas embodied in the amendments. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing them, as I certainly cannot commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We listened with great interest to what the Minister said. One purpose of our amendments was to try to discover more about Government thinking on this important appointment in an agency which will need to look confident from the start. Its origins and birth do not encourage one to have much confidence in it, and I fear that the big world outside will not have much confidence in it either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the appointment of a chairman, part-time or full-time, is of considerable concern. Our amendments sought to exclude certain people, partly from a desire to ensure that the Government appreciate the important need to appoint someone who will give the agency some authority. Following the Minister's announcement on 14 March, the trade press showed that the oil industry was rubbing its hands—the comments, jibes and asides on the creation of the new agency were noticeable. In consequence, the appointment assumed an undue importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister twitted us that we were contradictory in supporting small oil enterprises. This is the Government who tried to boast about the creation of small enterprises. As far as I can see, the way to create a small business in Britain at the moment is to have a large one and wait. The decline of British business from large to small has been the most noticeable feature of the past four or five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
I am glad that the Minister thinks that Enterprise Oil has been a great success. After the debacle of the flotation, a small company called RTZ has nearly 29 per cent. of its shares — another illustration of a so-called "small" company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this was a slimmed down agency, so that there might be no need for a full time chairman. He said that the membership of the board should reflect the size and organisation of the agency. It has a borrowing power of between £20 million and £80 million. I do not know what the Minister's bank balance looks like these days. However, such a borrowing capability is not an insubstantial power, so the agency is not all that small in some of its functions. We hope to enhance its role and function on clause 2, although it is not small even as presently structured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an interesting debate on Second Reading. One or two Conservative Members expressed unease about how much of a role the agency would have in the amount of royalty in kind oil that it would be trading in. We shall consider that in more detail on clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Parliamentary Under-Secretary suggested that royalty in kind oil will be of the order of 260,000 or 270,000 barrels a day, which is not exactly small, although the Minister emphasises the small size and the slimmed down nature of the agency. He may say that we are contradictory, but we shall aim to enhance the agency. It is not that small even as presented in the Bill, although its financial or trading power is far less than we believe is essential in the interests of the national security supply. It is not small and the Minister should not assume that the appointment of a full-time chairman is not justified by the size of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that previous Labour Governments had appointed retired civil servants. But one learns from experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mistakes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, experience. One develops one's thinking. The Minister's thoughts may be stuck in time, but mine are not. I am willing to listen. I am an unabashed believer in the idea that BNOC, as it was constituted in 1975, should be close to government and Whitehall. It was intended to fulfil a role on behalf of the nation through the Government and the House. There was intended to be a close working relationship. I should like the agency to have the same. However, with the Minister and others in government, I am very reluctant for the agency to be tied too closely to Whitehall or the Department of Energy. It will need independence, especially given the curious way in which it is being born and the apparently half-hearted support for it from Conservative Back Benchers and even the Minister in some of his remarks. If I created the Land Authority for Wales, this agency is his baby. I hope that he takes pride in it, and we shall help him give pride to it. However, we are apprehensive that he will not and that this is a staging post on the way to abolition. We know from its function and limited role and the fact that the amount of royalty in kind oil will decline, that unless the agency is nurtured and supported, it could wither. It could not then get good staff, or, if it did, they would leave fairly quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion central to these amendments is that the Opposition want an agency with a measure of independence which could obtain authority and would not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
appear to be an adjunct to the Department of Energy. We do not mind if the Minister does not accept the amendments. Indeed, we shall not press them. However, if he appoints a retired civil servant, it will send out a signal to the oil industry that the agency will not be an organisation of real consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 is the weakest of our amendments. If the Government recruited a chairman of real standing and weight in the oil game, it could help to enhance the agency and give it a sense of authority. I hope that we agree that we want one soon. As I said earlier, there is considerable worry and uncertainty about the terrible business of transition from BNOC to the agency, particularly among the younger staff. I hope that later we can persuade the Minister to change his heart, if not anything else, when we discuss the recruitment of agency staff from the existing BNOC staff. As I have said, some of the pipeline division's nine staff will want to go to the agency, but four or five of them do not believe that there will be a good enough career structure or an organisation that will enhance their careers and reputations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if I go on my hands and knees to the Minister I can persuade him to let that small group go with the rest of the oil trading staff and accept redundancy. If not, the one thing that could help them have confidence in a future career is the appointment of a chairman of real stature as quickly as possible. That will give the agency authority and weight. Perhaps then the apprehension of some BNOC staff who will be virtually forced to transfer will be allayed. No one with a £25,000 mortgage can afford to volunteer to resign these days. How many Ministers or civil servants would resign voluntarily or would go into a very changed organisation that did not offer the same career opportunities? If the Minister will not come with us that far, at least the appointment of a full-time chairman would help. He should be someone of substance and stature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled the amendments because we want the Minister to think about the nature of the agency and the character of the person who will head it. I hope that the Minister has listened to our arguments, even if they are unacceptable to him. We have tried to convey that it is essential to get the new agency off the ground as quickly as possible. As the Minister will have taken heed and listened to our submissions, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment in the hope that, before we proceed too far, he will announce the appointment of a chairman. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few introductory words about each of the amendments before advancing my detailed arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint attraction of amendments Nos. 6 and 7 is that mathematics—I am no mathematician—often present a fascinating paradox. In amendment No. 6, we propose to increase the minimum number of members by one, which would increase the minimum size of the board by 50 per cent. In amendment No. 7, we propose to increase the maximum by one and, although that is the same increase, we should be increasing the board's size by only 25 per cent. That paradox may have created some interest among Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for tabling the amendments is to contribute to the reduction of unemployment; I shall labour that point a little more later in my remarks, but at this stage I want to make some general introductory remarks about amendment No. 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had second thoughts about part of amendment No. 8, because I was woken up at 2.30 this morning. I was staying in a hotel in Paris, and my room was by the road. I stay in that hotel often and am generally given a room at the back. At 2.30 am, a woman started to call a cat. She was screaming, trilling and shouting and that went on for about an hour and a half. I am an animal lover, but I would cheerfully have strangled the cat and the woman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am telling this story because the proposed paragraph (d) in amendment No. 8 refers to "a female member". If the lady in my story wants a job in the agency, I trust that the Minister will not give her one. The Minister may say, "But that lady is French."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a member of the board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The French unemployment level under a Socialist Government is lower than ours, so I am not suggesting that we assist them. As the woman kept calling, "Kitty", she must have been an Englishwoman living in Paris. If she has now lost her cat, she may want to come home to be reunited with her family. But I do not want her to get a job on the board. The further away she goes, the better—anywhere, as long as she does not disturb decent, respectable English people by screaming and trilling in the most shrill tones at 2.30 am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that if we keep "female member", we can consider on Report an amendment, members of the board shall not be cat lovers nor resident in Paris during any part of 1985. I lost most of my night's sleep because of that lady's shrill, strident voice and her missing cat. I hope that the Committee and you, Mr. Knox, will not mind my expressing my feelings about her and her benighted pet. She may have qualifications for other jobs and be equipped in some way to serve the public interest, but she did not serve it at 2.30 this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response to our pleas on the previous amendments was dreadful and utterly disappointing though perhaps understandable, but we always live in hope. The Committee disposed of those amendments hurriedly—perhaps too hurriedly. The Minister is good natured. If he had spent a little longer reflecting on our proposition, he would have understood the need to concentrate on removing anxiety and relieving frustration among BNOC's employees. He would have seen the merits of our proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
It is not too late. The Minister may decide to reconsider and come back on Report. In case he does not, it is important to emphasise the provision in paragraph (c) of amendment No. 8 that a person
	<br><blockquote><p>"who has substantial experience within the trade union movement"</p></blockquote>
should serve on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past five or six years, trade union organisers have learned a great deal about redundancy, unemployment and anxiety and fear among employees, be they wage earners or salaried staff. Some of the greatest tragedies have befallen those who held responsible managerial positions and who are now without work. Trade union organisers have gained enormous experience in dealing with redundancy and in learning how to comfort, reassure and engender hope in those who have lost their jobs. They have learned to relieve what is perhaps worse — the anxieties of those who fear that they may lose their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that BNOC employees are not expected to lose their jobs. That is serious wishful thinking. I think that many BNOC employees will lose their jobs and that a substantial number are anxious about their prospects. Does the Minister intend to maintain his opposition to appointing a full-time chairman with skills in relevant directions and experience in reassuring those who are afraid? If the Minister does not intend to give way and come back on Report showing that the Government have something of a heart, he has no alternative but to accept the logic of the first part of amendment No. 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman also agree that it is not only members of the trade union movement who have had a lot to do with redundancies and with understanding people's fears? Many people in management have coped successfully with the same problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that argument entirely. I have several friends at the sharp end of industry who have had that tragic task to perform. One of my constituents not only had to negotiate redundancy terms for hundreds of workers, but, in the odd minute that he could spare, for himself too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those with relevant qualities usually get other jobs if they have developed experience dealing with redundancies, because so many firms are declaring redundancies and need people with experience, sad and grievous as it may be, to assist them to get rid of even more jobs. Those who have been dealing with redundancies year after year, and have been exposed to all the distress, anxiety and frustration that employees feel in those circumstances have relevant abilities even if not necessarily paper qualifications, although some also have those, and in profusion. We would not necessarily be looking for someone with a first-class honours degree in psychology. I am not contemptuous of such people, and it would be right that they should be considered, but I do not regard a psychology degree as an essential qualification. However, I should regard it as essential that there should be someone on the board with substantial experience within the trade union movement. For the first year of the board's existence, that requirement will be dominant, regardless of any other attribute or qualification that may be sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. The agency is likely to engage in 100 miles of
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
pipeline and 25 storage terminals, and a certain amount of selling of oil. If it is to have only 30 to 40 staff, why is a man qualified in trade union affairs needed on the board? Surely the best directors to be found should be selected, and not necessarily people with these qualifications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has failed to perceive the reality of the argument. The staff of the agency may well come down to 30 or 40. That is our point. But it will not necessarily reach that figure at once. Can the hon. Member think of any company in which the labour force is being contracted so dramatically?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone will have the task of persuading 30 or 40 people to stay. They will have watched all their friends being declared redundant, will have seen the full horror and frustration of the contraction of numbers. They may feel like saying, "The sooner we get out of this organisation the better; if they are sacking large numbers of people like this, what is the point of staying? What are the career prospects in an organisation of only 40 employees?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must bear in mind that something savage is being done to BNOC which was a substantial organisation and is to be replaced by a tiny one. People who joined BNOC probably saw themselves with a considerable career before them. This legislation has developed apparently only in the past few weeks, and until then BNOC employees might have assumed that they could carry on serving the corporation and the country by acquiring skills and applying themselves to their work. They now find themselves threatened with redundancy. If the hon. Gentleman is right and the consequence of the Bill is that only 30 or 40 people are to be employed, there will be a need for a board member with the necessary and relevant experience of dealing with employees threatened with redundancies. The hon. Gentleman's intervention merely strengthens my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose—I assure you this is relevant, Mr. Knox—that a company has 395 or 400 employees but that the number is to be reduced to 40. Surely, the other 355 or 360 people will be extremely worried. There are now 395 Conservative Members of Parliament; if the opinion polls continu1 to show results such as those reported recently, there will only be 40 or 50 after the next general election. The Minister of State will start worrying then, and so will his hon. Friends. Perhaps they will need to employ qualified and experienced trade union organisers to assist and advise them on the path to redundancy. I hope that that experience befalls the hon. Gentleman, especially if he refuses to admit the logic of what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If BNOC's workforce is to be contracted so that only 40 of its employees are given work in the new agency, great distress and anxiety will be caused. Motivation will ebb, too. Career prospects will be blighted, and, in our materialistic world, if that happens, motivation will also go out of the window. The agency needs to succeed, to respond to the challenges that it faces and to fulfil its important function. That function touches on national security; we are not talking about producing bingo prizes, or printing betting slips, or serving in nightclubs or any of the frills and frivolities of our society. We are discussing a matter of vital national concern — the security and survival of our nation. It is therefore essental that the 40 or so people who are to continue working with the agency should be motivated. Conservative Members have not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
even begun to perceive that blighting the career prospects of the small staff at the agency will mar and disfigure motivation in the enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are only 128 employees now. Many responsibilities are to be removed from BNOC and given to the agency. Depleted responsibilities must involve lesser manpower.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only 120! For the last six years, the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have been saying, "Only a hundred jobs there; only another hundred there; only a few hundred there." The sum total of those — sometimes small—contractions is 4 million people unemployed. It is time the hon. Gentleman realised that we must start fighting even for jobs in penny numbers — I do. Unemployment in my constituency is now over 30 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is again wandering into a discussion about unemployment in general. Could he please confine himself to the amendment that he is moving?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman failed to understand my argument. He said that a relatively small number of jobs were at stake; that does not matter. The undertaking is a vital and important one. It is essential to maintain motivation, but the contraction in the work force will affect motivation. Other companies, seeing the quality of BNOC employees, may offer them jobs, and the Minister might even find it difficult to keep 40 people working for the agency—especially if the economy revives during the next 12 to 18 months, although I do not expect a general election before then.

I have already referred to the question of the female member of the board. Some ladies should not be considered for the post, and I want the Minister to assure us that no lady resident in Paris who keeps cats will be allowed to serve on that board.
