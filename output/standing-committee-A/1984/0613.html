<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Oil and Pipelines Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That, with effect from Tuesday 18 June, during the further proceedings on the Oil and Pipelines. Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It is worth reminding the Committee that the decision to introduce the Bill was taken only in March this year, following changes in the structure of the oil market at the end of last year and the early part of this year. No time was wasted. After the decision was taken, only about seven weeks was spent preparing the Bill and Parliament has about three months until the start of the recess to debate it.<br><br>
I wish for a proper debate on this important Bill, but equally, and not surprisingly, I want its passage onto the statute book. This is our fifth sitting and we have spent about nine and a half hours on clause 1 and schedule 1. I have no complaint about that and we have had some good and useful debates. However, given the time of the Session and our desire to get the Bill onto the statute book, I must ask the Committee to be tolerant and to sit more frequently to ensure that we can debate the Bill properly and carry our discussion forward.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said at the end of our previous sitting that he would bitterly oppose such a motion. I understand why he would wish to do so but I also know his deep desire to debate the Bill fully and in detail, so I hope that we can dispose of the motion without too much delay and return to the main substance of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a sad moment. The Minister has inflicted on us news which demonstrates the utterly unfeeling and insensitive approach of the Government. It is an intemperate, unjustified and hasty decision. As we go through the night on Tuesday I hope that the smiles of approbation from Conservative Members will gradually contract. Perhaps then they will be a little more sympathetic to our view that the Government are trying to get their legislation through by using the weapon of exhaustion. It is a sad state of affairs.<br><br>
Were Opposition Members not constructive in our approach the Minister might be justified in feeling impatient, but we have been entirely constructive. If the Minister feels that the Committee has not made enough progress he must understand that much of our time has been taken up—directly or influenced in-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
directly —not by Opposition Members but by Conservative Members. For example, at our previous sitting the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) made the longest intervention that I have heard in my 15 years in the House. I am not complaining; the hon. Gentleman was right to intervene, and I was entirely justified in giving way. It would be inappropriate and out of order for me to suggest that the hon. Gentleman was filibustering. It certainly was not a filibuster; it was a relevant, if exceedingly long, intervention. I object to Opposition Members being penalised because Conservative Members intervene at enormous length.<br><br>
If one looks through <i>Hansard,</i> one sees that the name of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) appears frequently. He has not yet given us the benefit of his sustained and knowledgeable interest in the oil industry, but no doubt he will do so in the early hours of our sittings next week. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North is an honest man, and he will admit immediately that he has frequently made interventions, sometimes from a seated position, that have caused speeches to be unduly protracted, and Opposition Members have been penalised because of those interventions. This is the first time in our proceedings that I have spoken for four minutes when the hon. Gentleman has not said anything. His smile bodes ill for us in the early hours of next week.<br><br>
The decision is intemperate for a serious reason. The Minister said that the Government made their hasty decision only a few weeks ago. In March, as a result of what the Government said, the House believed that no change was likely to be made. Then suddenly, the House and the country were inflicted with the decision that brought about the Bill. The House and the country have not had a great deal of time to consider the serious implications of the Bill. Therefore, Opposition Members decided not to rush at the Bill, so that, as a result of a careful and assiduous approach, the Committee could consider it in detail.<br><br>
So far, we have not touched on some of the major aspects of the Bill. We have not considered in detail the pipelines. We have spent much of our time talking about the role, duties and manning of the agency. We have discussed the salaries and conditions, including the tea breaks, of those who are to be employed in the agency. That was all very proper. I am not casting aspersions on you, Mr. Knox, as Chairman, or on the other hon. Gentlemen who have occupied the Chair. Those matters are important, but they are overshadowed by the importance of issues such as the trading and participation arrangements, and the essential task of the agency to advise the Department of Energy, which often needs considerable advice.<br><br>
We have not begun to consider what is perhaps the basic reason for the Bill—the strategic nature of our pipelines. In all the years that those pipelines have existed, Parliament has given them scarcely any attention, and this Committee provides the opportunity for the detailed consideration that is now appropriate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0128">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
Our approach is one of constructive assiduity, to give the Committee time properly to consider matters of great moment, to do that without seeking to abuse the rules and practices of the House in any way, and to allow, as we have always graciously allowed, Conservative Members who are reluctant to make speeches to intervene so that they can participate in what must be a serious consideration.<br><br>
The Minister cannot complain that we have not got the Bill through Committee, when the Government decided to introduce the legislation only seven weeks ago. Why are they so impatient?<br><br>
Rumours always circulate around the House after the spring break about the date on which the House will rise for the summer recess. There will probably be further rumours this week and different rumours next week, but last week I heard rumours—no doubt carefully cultivated by the Government's business managers—that the House might sit into the second week of August. I dismissed those rumours—as you would have done, Mr. Knox because I recognise that some of the hon. Members who now direct the nation's affairs are eager to ensure that they get away for their holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not attribute such views to the Chair. The Chair is completely impartial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that you are so devoted to your duties, Mr. Knox, that you take a dispassionate view of the duration of parliamentary recesses. But that dispassionate view is not held by most hon. Members and, in view of recent events in respect of the Bill, it is not shared by those responsible for directing the tactics of the Government. They have fomented those rumours. They believe that they cannot afford to devote time to the Bill in the normal way, because they cannot fight Conservative Members who wish to be away from the House before grouse shooting starts on 12 August so that they are refreshed and ready to slaughter this native British species on our hearther-clad uplands.<br><br>
My hon. Friends and I will therefore be expected to be here through the early hours next week and the following week until the Government get their Bill through Committee. They will achieve their aim by ruthlessly using the weapon of exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands </span><span class='membercontribution'>(Merthyr Tydfil): They will not exhaust us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, we shall be fatigued. There is no doubt about that, but that fatigue will be justified because we believe that Parliament should consider the Bill in detail. We believe that seven weeks is not sufficient time for Parliament to approve such a Bill. Conservative Members may be so docile in their obedience and loyalty to the Government that they are prepared to act irresponsibly.<br><br>
It would be wrong for me to indulge in a lecture on constitutional structures and proprieties, but we have a duty to consider such matters, because they are relevant. Parliament has an overriding function:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
to question, examine, check and, if necessary, criticise or even abuse the Executive. That is the basic historic function of this House and is shared by all hon. Members.<br><br>
Conservative Back Benchers do not exist to rubber stamp unquestioningly every suggestion, enactment, deed and word of Ministers. Yet they are prepared to allow the Minister of State to introduce a sittings motion which will in effect prevent them from devoting proper consideration to, or offering their individual advice about, a measure of enormous importance.<br><br>
While it is right that we should abuse the Executive when such action is deserved, we must pay tribute to the Minister of State because his conduct in Committee to date has been unfailingly courteous. We must therefore assume that he is being forced by his superiors to propose a sittings motion to the Committee and I am sorry that he has to act in that way. The business managers will have instructed him to get the Bill through Committee by a certain date. There is a gleaming smile on the face of the representative of the Government business managers. I wish that the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant) would pay attention, because that is part of his job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Tony Durant</span><span class='membercontribution'> (Reading, West): I am paying attention.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy </span><span class='membercontribution'>: The business managers of the Government have forced the Minister of State to come forward with this sittings motion. The business managers and their friends in the Whips' office play a necessary role. I do not criticise the Whips; they have their job to do, and the hon. Member for Reading, West is doing his job. However, we shall be increasingly resentful of the Whips' roles in the early hours. They do not have to make long speeches; their job is simply to make sure that their hon. Friends do not fulfil their constitutional role.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North has been an hon. Member for longer than I have. He knows that he will be very unpopular if he seeks to devote attention to those parts of the Bill on which he could knowledgeably offer comment. By contracting the time scale of consideration, the Government may be assisted in ensuring that their supporters do not devote time to assess the Government's proposals or to suggest amendments and argue their merits coherently.<br><br>
The sittings motion seems to contradict the essential attitude that so far the Minister of State has shown unfailingly. At times he has sought to be helpful, and at all times he has sought to be courteous. He may feel that because he knows that we appreciate his courtesy we are satisfied by his manner and detailed response to the Committee.<br><br>
The Minister knows that from time to time we have thanked him for snippets of information. He has given a detailed response to our inquiries. For example, he was promptly forthcoming when Opposition Members asked him who had already been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0129">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
appointed to the agency. We were grateful for that. He gave us information on other matters relating to the manning of the agency, such as the fact that the provision of tea during a morning break was not an appropriate matter to enshrine in the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister has given us information whenever he could, but we are now being asked to embark on an outrageous timetable when we still have not had some of the information that we requested. I shall give the Minister a few examples of information that we think that we should have been given before this sittings motion was introduced.<br><br>
Earlier in our proceedings I raised the question of rates and you, quite properly, Mr. Knox, prevented the Committee from considering the details of those aspects of the rating system that were not directly relevant to the Bill. But some aspects are relevant and the Minister was kind enough to tell the Committee that last year £750,000 was paid by BNOC to the City of Westminster. That is a lot of money; I only wish that BNOC were situated in Rotherham as our council could spend that money more effectively and valuably than Westminster city council, which probably has enough money already.<br><br>
We asked the Minister to tell us the rates for the same premises for the previous three years, so that the Committee could asses the corporation's problems which, to a large extent, will be inherited by the agency. We have not yet had that information.<br><br>
We have asked on several debates, and we still ask, whether the Minister will ensure that the agency will not consist of only three people. We explained in an earlier debate how dangerous it would be for a quorum rule to be determined, in effect, by the agency chairman, as it would be if there were only three members. Mathematically and logically it was easy to show how dangerous that would be. There must be four members if tite agency is to be a coherent organisation. We have still not had either a firm assurance or a firm denial from the Minister.<br><br>
It should be possible to effect a proper comparison between the chairmanship of the OPA which is to be a part-time function within the Department of Energy's sphere of influence, and the full-time chairmanship of another public corporation also within the Department of Energy's sphere of influence. I picked out the chairmanship of the National Coal Board. Such a comparison is desirable when we consider role, function, conditions and emoluments. That information is completely relevant. It should, along with the other snippets of information that we have sought, have been given to the Committee to enable us to proceed with our considerations before the Minister turned finally to the desperate course of the sittings motion.<br><br>
I am glad to see the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) come in to the Committee. He will have learnt from my remarks that the Committee has been hurt, threatened and oppressed by the sittings motion, which is likely to keep us here through the night on. Tuesday and Thursday next week, the week after and perhaps for ever more. I note that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
(Mr. Portillo) is somewhat amused at the prospect of continuous involvement with the Committee through Tuesday and Thursday night. The Opposition do not find it amusing. I am sure that you, Mr. Knox, do not find it amusing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have absolutely no views on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that you have no public view on the matter, Mr. Knox. However, you must have winced at the prospect of sitting endlessly through every Tuesday and Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not speculate on what is in the Chairman's mind. It may not be very much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You do yourself a disservice, Mr. Knox. However, I recognise the properties and I shall not pursue that course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Martin Redmond<span class='memberconstituency'> (Don Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel sure that the Minister would withdraw the motion out of consideration for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would have to be decided outside the Committee, although my hon. Friend's suggestion is very reasonable. We know how devoted and independent our Standing Committee Chairmen have to be. However, all Ministers should understand that all Committee chairmen—not just you, Mr. Knox—should receive consideration. I doubt whether Committee Chairmen have received a moment's consideration from the Government's business managers when they have decided to introduce sittings motions. They use such motions far too readily. I know that all Governments have used them, and some Front-Bench spokesmen have responded with speeches that are a little exaggerated. Mine is not such a speech. It is justifiable because the Minister is spoiling his record of courtesy and consideration. That is regrettable.<br><br>
Few Conservative Ministers have shown any understanding of the need to maintain their democratic appeal. People who override the wishes of Parliament and seek to ignore and deflect the duties of Parliament are the unacceptable face of the Conservative party. The Minister of State has always sought to accept this veneer of democracy—a veneer of consideration—while his colleagues are busy chipping away at it to ensure that he is reduced to their level. From a personal point of view, that is sad.<br><br>
However, we are talking about holidays. To make a sittings motion acceptable, the Government start a rumour that Parliament will sit into the middle of August. Some Conservative Members may have booked their holidays, so they are naturally a little feaful of not being able to go on holidays with their families—a very proper thing for them to do. To capitalise on that fear, a rumour is spread to soften them up and persuade them that if they accept the sittings motion they can guarantee their holidays.<br><br>
However, another rumour has started in the House in the past day or two—that we shall rise on 26 July. That is unreasonable. There is no reason for the House to rise on 26 July. We accept the traditional pattern of British political decision-making,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0130">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
and we know that the House has to rise by 11 August, because of grouse shooting on the 12th, but there is a fair amount of time between 26 July and 11 August. The Government should not proceed on the assumption that they have the support of their Back-Bench Members for sittings motion so that those hon. Members can go on holiday on 26 July.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wallace <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's proposal fills me—and, no doubt, other Scottish Members—with alarm. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not realise that although English school holidays may not start until the end of July, most school holidays in Scotland are over by the first week in August. If we sit until 11 August, many Scottish Members will have no time to spend with their families in the summer. This legislation is undoubtedly important, but we also believe in upholding family life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was expecting the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) to say that, because I am well aware of the different time structure of school terms in Scotland. I have been in the House a long time, and every year at this time our Scottish colleagues, eager to fulfil their family responsibilities, become anxious lest the House sit too long.<br><br>
Sometimes it is apparent that Conservative Members are able to go away for six or eight weeks at a time during the summer recess, while Opposition Members rarely go away with their families on holiday for more than one or two weeks. We do not go round collecting directorships to increase our incomes to the point at which we can afford to take six or eight weeks' holiday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been quite good so far, but he is beginning to stretch his argument. Outside occupations have nothing to do with the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have nothing to do with the Bill, but they have an influence in determining the length of holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No; the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always respect your views, Mr. Knox. All I am saying is that even if we fulfil our duties and continue up to 11 August, there will be enough time, even in the far north of Scotland, for the modest holidays that Scottish Members can sustain.<br><br>
There is another aspect. I took a school party to Switzerland some years ago, and I became very critical of school overseas holidays because some of the children behaved badly and were very noisy. There was a group from Hertfordshire, whose boys were little better than gangsters, and there was a group of children from Scotland who were exceedingly noisy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Can the hon. Gentleman quickly relate what he is saying to the sittings motion, as I find it difficult to relate school parties to the motion?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy </span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is simply related. As a result of the noise that Scottish school children make, their fathers who are Members of Parliament should not be eager to have parliamentary recesses coinciding with the whole of the school holidays. They could afford to sit another two or three weeks in the House, and make the three weeks remaining with their children entirely enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will move very quickly to his next point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will. The Minister of State has been courteous, and we deeply regret that his courtesy is now marred by this unfeeling and insensitive proposal. He has been considerate in providing some answers to our questions, but he has moved the sittings motion before we have had other information that we have sought which would allow us to determine our approach to certain aspects of the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister has not been consistent. In moving the sittings motion, he accepted that Parliament and the country had had remarkably little time to consider this hastily introduced Bill. Therefore, the Committee should spend a great deal of detailed time in considering the Bill's implications.<br><br>
We had just reached clause 2 when the hon. Member for Southgate stood up at five to One in our previous sitting. The Minister should accept that clause 2 is the major clause. Frankly, he has not provided the information that we need to consider clause 2 expeditiously.<br><br>
Some of us feel that the Committee should proceed, without haste, without hurry and flurry, and that we should consider the Bill with deliberation and care. The Minister has certainly not complained about that approach in the past. If he felt impatient or that we were not proceeding quickly enough, he should have asked us to be more expeditious and should have provided the information that we seek. I know that the Minister will wish to provide it, but until we have information about the rates paid by BNOC and comparisons between the conditions of the chairman of the OPA and those of the chairman of the NCB, we should not agree to his request.<br><br>
Conservative Members also have a responsibility. It is no good their resting on their record in the Committee because they have got their name in <i>Hansard</i> for reading newspapers when they should not have done, and when you rightly had to draw their attention to it, Mr. Knox.<br><br>
I have a point about the role and function of the Chair. I have never been particularly concerned about the detailed interpretation of the rules of the House. You may have no alternative but to call the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North to officiate in your place when you have to leave the Chair, Mr. Knox.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whoever I ask to invite to sit in the Chair temporarily is nothing to do with the hon. Gentleman, and nothing to do with the sittings motion.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0131">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It could be, if we sit through the night and you call a Member who has infuriated the Committee to occupy the Chair in your place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is nothing to do with the sittings motion, as the hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get on!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the first contribution from the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North this morning. I have been trying to get him to intervene for the past 30 minutes. His phrase " Get on! " will be in<i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If I may say so, the remarks of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) were as much out of order as those of the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your stricture, Mr. Knox, and confess that I was at fault. Opposition Members will unfailingly accept responsibility when you upbraid them. I only wish that when you upbraid the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North he would adopt a more penitent pose.<br><br>
However, we have demonstrated that the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North is still alive, so our short consideration of the motion has some merit. We trust that, despite the Minister's haste and his intemperate approach, and despite the threatening and fearsome short-circuiting of proper parliamentary consideration, Conservative Members will be prepared to exercise themselves a little and offer their contributions to the proceedings of the Committee—even though it may be in the early hours of next Wednesday morning, next Thursday or during the following week.<br><br>
The Minister may feel, as he has now moved this dreadful sittings motion, that he is relieved of any obligation to give the Committee proper information or properly to respond to it. He may feel that he has managed the timetable so that key amendments will come up about 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning. I trust that he will recognise that even at that late and fatiguing hour, he must still provide the courtesy of giving detailed answers to our requests for information. I hope that he will not feel that the shift in the time pattern will relieve him of such obligations.<br><br>
The sittings motion represents a regrettable step, and one which we shall find exhausting. It is dangerous, as serious matters may receive more superficial consideration than they deserve. I trust that the Minister will so manage affairs that he will not inflict on his hon. Friends who have something to say—some may have a little, and the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) may have a great deal—the need to speak at the unreasonable hour that some of us currently fear. I am sorry that the motion has been moved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to underline the persuasive case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) against the sittings motion. There is an unusual species called the silent skeet; it is rarely seen, although I hope that it will not be so rare in future. We want to see the hon. Member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) making a proper, worthy and effective contribution to our proceedings.<br><br>
My fundamental objection to the motion is that it defies the spirit and the recommendations of a report on Standing Committees by a very distinguished body, the Select Committee on Procedure. It is astonishing that the Minister should come forward with this motion so soon after the publication of the potentially controversial report on Public Bill procedure. I shall draw hon. Members' attention to some of the comments and observations of the Select Committee.<br><br>
It is possible that the Minister, burrowing away as he does in the Millbank tower has not yet got round to reading that important report. Let me tell him of some of the recommendations of the Committee. I hope that he would never wish to defy the spirit of the report and he may wish to withdraw his motion in the light of them.<br><br>
Paragraph 4 of the report reads:
<br><blockquote><p>" Our main concern is that bills in standing committees should be properly considered. That is most likely to be achieved if bills are normally considered at a time of day which facilitates clear and careful thinking about their provisions. Neither the public at large "—</p></blockquote>
I am sure that they are following our deliberations intently—
<br><blockquote><p>" nor, we believe, the majority of Members, believe that it is desirable for detailed, technical matters to be debated in standing committee very late at night or even all through the night and the following morning."</p></blockquote>
That is the advice of the distinguished Procedure Committee. While I am not sure that it always applies—I have some of my best thoughts late at night, although I can never remember them in the morning—it is nevertheless a strong recommendation. But, although the report was only published on 23 April, the Government are already defying the spirit of that recommendation.<br><br>
Paragraph 4 of the report continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Also we think it highly undesirable that standing committee meetings should be prolonged purely in order to allow sufficient time to be used to justify the introduction of a timetable motion."</p></blockquote>
One of the things that we shall want to know from the Minister when he winds up the debate is whether he intends to guillotine the Bill. For there is no doubt that this is a guillotining Government. In an interesting appendix, the Select Committee report lists the Bills guillotined in Standing Committee since 1946. I was astonished to find that there have been only 33 ½—I do not know what half a Bill is—and that 14 of those occurred after 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing a sittings motion, not a guillotine motion, which is a matter for the Floor of the House and would not be an appropriate subject for the Committee to discuss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. But in my experience sittings motions are often a prelude to guillotines, and I thought it relevant to point out that as we now have government by guillotine, the sittings motion might be a preparation for that dreadful act. I hope that the Minister will assure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0132">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
us that that is not so. But, although a Select Committee report has told us that we should not discuss detailed technical legislation late at night or in the early hours of the morning, this motion seems to pave the way for just such a practice.<br><br>
The report makes other equally interesting observations about the way we should behave. There is a lovely comment from an hon. Member whose memorandum is based on his experience as a Treasury Minister serving on the Finance Bill Committee. He describes Standing Committees as
<br><blockquote><p>" the garrulous speaking to the silent".</p></blockquote>
I do not think we have been garrulous. Persuasive, eloquent, expansive, yes; but not garrulous. However, we have certainly been speaking to the silent for most of the time, and I hope that we are not going to justify that description of Standing Committee proceedings.<br><br>
The most interesting observation that I found in the report came from the Clerk of the House, who spoke of
<br><blockquote><p>"the delicate balance between the rights of the majority to expect reasonable despatch in the public business and the right of the minority to enforce the most careful scrutiny and a pause for second thoughts."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what we, as a minority, have been endeavouring to do. Our amendments show that we approve of careful scrutiny, but we also wish to establish the principle of a pause for second thoughts on clause 2 and on the Bill as a whole. However, there can be no pause for second thoughts if the Bill is railroaded through in a series of lengthy sessions this month. The aim is obviously to get the Bill through Committee before the end of the month. That is not a reasonable or fair way to proceed and it does not maintain the delicate balance which the Clerk of the House described. It is a very good description of the role of a Standing Committee and we should heed it.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
If we accept the motion, we shall not be able to fulfil that function or maintain that delicate balance. I shall not weary the Committee any further with references to that important report except to say that I deeply regret the fact that the Minister has chosen to defy its spirit so soon after its publication. We have not had a chance to debate the report yet, but I feel that what it says will strike a number of chords in us.<br><br>
When moving the motion, almost peremptorily, the Minister spoke of his two personal desires. But it is not the job of the House of Commons to pander to the personal desires of Ministers. They may be perfectly reasonable in personal terms, but not in terms of the legislation and the way in which we scrutinise it. There would be a justification for the motion if the Minister had made the case that this was a piece of emergency legislation—that it had to be got through because the nation was on the verge of a crisis. But even he has not had the audacity to suggest that the Bill is a piece of emergency legislation. We could co-operate fully with him
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
if he could prove to us that there was an emergency.<br><br>
The Minister has stood arguments on their head over the last few months. The week before he made the statement announcing this decision he gave evidence to the Select Committee on Energy which was completely contrary to the policy and proposals that he brings forward in the Bill. But there is no reason for the rest of us to behave like that. If the Minister wants to stand on his head and reverse all his earlier arguments that is up to him. But we should not pander to him and allow him this motion to railroad through a change of mind and a reversal of the case he made to the Select Committee only a week before he announced the proposals which led to the Bill.<br><br>
The Bill is a hastily cobbled up measure. It should not therefore be treated hastily. It needs to be treated with much thoroughness and seriousness, as the Opposition have sought to do in our few sittings to date. We have every right to ask for time to deal with the Bill and to do so in order and at a reasonable hour. As well as its major political content, the Bill includes many technical details. Not every member of the Committee is acquainted with the terms, " aggregating ", " lifting ", " evergreen ", " rollovers " and the rest of the language associated with the oil trade. We have not all managed to do sufficient homework in the time available to grapple with and grasp these issues.<br><br>
I must be one of a small minority of people who go to bed with participation agreements, although most members of the Committee probably do. Those of us who have to go to bed with participation agreements know how much time we have spent in consideration and effort. The amendment that we tabled yesterday shows the amount of midnight work we have done drafting a model participation agreement. It took time, but we were willing to spend that time. We are not unwilling to do our homework, so it is not unreasonable to ask the Government to give all members of the Committee the time to do their homework.<br><br>
I was surprised at how little homework the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) had done before moving his amendment. A Cambridge Peterhouse scholar should do more homework. Clearly, the hon. Gentleman was surprised by the rush and pace of the Bill, and he admitted it when he spoke on Tuesday. We should rescue the hon. Gentleman and let him do some more homework on certain aspects of the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister should not deprive his hon. Friends of the opportunity to do such work. As he pointed out, the land pipelines side of BNOC is extremely important and it has been much neglected by the House. We have not spent enough time on it, and we do not know enough about it. I confess that it has been hard work trying to do one's homework on the land pipelines, but I have done some, which I hope to demonstrate when we return to the amendment that we were considering before we were rudely interrupted by the Minister's motion.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0133">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
The Bill needs a lot of beavering. I am proud to say that I have no research assistants. I do not have any nubile American girls doing research. I do my own homework; I am my own research assistant, and I believe passionately in doing my own research. Indeed, I go to bed with participation agreements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is very interesting, but I do not think that it is a matter for the Committee who or what the hon. Gentleman goes to bed with. It is certainly nothing to do with the sittings motion, so will he return to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining that, as a diligent member of the Committee, I need time to work on certain aspects of the Bill—as, I am sure, do other hon. Members. If the sittings motion goes through, we shall not have time to do the necessary research and the work on the Bill.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of other aspects of the Bill that need time and research. Royalty oil and liquid petroleum gas need major study and analysis. Those are not simple and easy subjects to read about; they take time to consider, work on and prepare for.<br><br>
Moreover, the structure of the Bill causes problems for all members of the Committee. It involves a feature that has been growing since 1979, in that the Bill is basically an enabling Bill, with a couple of clauses. On the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 we saw that the modern style of parliamentary drafting and preparation of Bills is to put as little as possible into a Bill and to give Ministers the maximum discretion to exercise broad, sweeping powers.<br><br>
Like its counterpart in the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, clause 2 consists of only about 20 lines, which enable the Minister to do almost anything he wants. Extra detailed scrutiny is necessary because of the character and structure of this legislation. We are not willing to give the Government and the Minister the wide and sweeping powers contained in clause 2 without attempting to amend it and to flesh out the purpose of the clause. A precedent is being created in which we are interested.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. T. H. H. SKEET<i> in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>We welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Skeet.</p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am very much obliged. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will make a short speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that the role of the Chairman was to tell an hon. Member about the length of his speech.<br><br>
You, Mr. Skeet, are obviously trying to follow the distinguished Chairman, Miss Fookes. The report of the Select Committee on Procedure notes her suggestion:
<br><blockquote><p>" when a Member moves an amendment at great length, but avoids irrelevance and tedious repetition, it ought to be possible for another Member to move ' that the hon. Member be no longer heard '."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are talking about tedious repetition, not one word has been said by Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Back Benchers have been irrelevant, but not tedious, in the sense that they have been silent. I am not sure whether, when you enjoined me to be both brief and short, Mr. Skeet, you were trying to implement proposals that have not yet been approved by the House. I recommend that no Opposition Members should support parts of those recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not report what I said. All I suggested was that one should economise on the use of words, which is a good discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never do anything else, although that is hard for Welshmen.<br><br>
When you took the Chair, Mr. Skeet, I was explaining to the Minister the character and nature of Government legislation. You served with distinction on the Committee on the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, Mr. Skeet, so we are among the few veterans from that Committee. We know that the modern trend in drafting legislation is towards short, enabling Bills, giving huge powers of discretion to Ministers. As a result, the Bills require extra scrutiny and attention by hon. Members on both sides, to ensure that we are not granting powers to Ministers which we have not considered in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Skeet. I wonder whether it is in order for a Sub-Committee to be in progress at the same time as this Committee, and whether you could use your good office to ask the hon. Gentlemen to let everyone hear what they are saying or go into the Corridor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the argument carefully, and was not aware of a Sub-Committee. Any hon. Members who were talking among themselves will have noted the hon. Gentleman's observation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. Redmond) for defending my rights, and to you, Mr. Skeet, for being sure that you will do so, too.<br><br>
The trend towards enabling Bills in modern legislation places an onerous duty on hon. Members to give special attention to the legislation, so they should have a reasonable time in which to do so.<br><br>
It is not the Opposition's fault that the Bill is so late coming to the House, or that the Government are attempting to start and finish a Bill in June. The only justification for that is if there is a crisis deadline to be met. The Opposition would then give full support to it. However, not a shred of evidence has been produced by the Government to justify the notion that this is emergency legislation.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the Opposition's proper response if co-operation is required in the national interest at a time of crisis, there is surely another classification. If the Government want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
hasten progress on the Bill and accept the difficulties that the short timescale imposes, they say to the Opposition, " We want to get the Bill through, we want your support in getting it through in an unreasonably short time, and, because we realise that it is unreasonable, we are prepared to accept your proposals for amendment." My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) will have noted that the Government have been contemptuous of every amendment that we have tabled so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy), who is clearly competing with the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) in the length of his interventions. He may not have made it that time, but he is working up to it.<br><br>
Neither the Government nor the Minister have justified the need for undue haste in our proceedings on this legislation. He cannot justify allowing us basically one month in which to consider major legislation which, although short in clauses, is long in consequence and importance. He is not justified in trying to railroad the Bill through Parliament.<br><br>
There is no crisis deadline. If the Minister can prove that BNOC will continue to lose money unless we pass the Bill, that is a reason for railroading the Bill and moving this sittings motion. But he cannot prove that. We assume that BNOC is no longer bleeding and that until the Bill becomes law, it is still responsible for handling our participation oil and royalty oil in kind. I understand, and no doubt the Minister will confirm, that BNOC is now taking the action that it wanted to take some months ago to adjust its prices to avoid further losses. So there is no major financial reason for pushing the Bill through, and there is nothing to suggest that BNOC is in serious financial trouble.<br><br>
Secondly, even though the Bill has not yet been passed, BNOC has been making arrangements to unravel all the participation contracts. That process will continue, irrespective of the time that this Bill takes to go through. The Bill is not necessary as a piece of emergency legislation to terminate the participation contracts. Those contracts are being terminated—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Mr. Skeet. Could you ask the people in the Public Gallery to be quiet, because I am having great difficulty in hearing my hon Friend? [HON. MEMBERS: " Move nearer."]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that members of the public are talking very quietly, and they are not impeding the development of the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Skeet. I assure you that I have excellent hearing, but I cannot hear because of the background noise. Will you use your good offices to ask the public to keep quiet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is a matter for me. I do not feel that the amount of noise is undue.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. Redmond) for having my welfare at heart.<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry that he not listening to me; he has left; I am doing an excellent job in emptying the Committee Room.<br><br>
I come back to what I was saying. BNOC is no longer in serious financial danger now that it has amended its pricing policy. As it appears to be moving in advance of the Bill to unravel the participation agreements and contracts, there is no need to railroad the Bill through in the time scale sought by the Government.<br><br>
During our last sitting, we had a long debate about staffing. Surely it is also reasonable for members of staff to have time to consider their future. I do not think that the pace at which we are dealing with the Bill will affect their welfare, although the Bill itself and the Government's attitude towards those concerned is bound to do so.<br><br>
Clause 3 makes provision for a transitional period after the Bill's enactment, although we have not yet debated that. The Minister cannot argue that there is a desperate need to get the legislation through in order to handle the problems created by transfer from a national oil corporation to an oil and pipelines agency. The Bill also provides for a commencement order which could come into effect weeks or months after the Bill had been enacted. The Minister did not even attempt to put forward a case for making haste in dealing with the legislation.<br><br>
As this is only our fifth sitting, we have made good progress. This is only a five-clause Bill, and we have already debated one clause and one schedule. The Minister remarked, perhaps sotto voce, on how expeditiously we had dealt with clause 1, and commented on the generous spirit in which the Opposition had dealt with the Bill. We did not sit tardily, as we could have done, for the clause stand part debate. Clause 2 is quite substantial and needs detailed attention and scrutiny, but a sittings motion at this time cannot be justified in view of the expeditious way in which the Committee has been dealing with the legislation.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. DAVID KNOX <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>Why do we have to railroad the Bill through? I have considered the Government's motives. First, they have got the management of their business into a jam. It is unusual and inappropriate to introduce a Bill in June, except in the case of emergency legislation. There is a danger that the Bill will not be enacted before the summer recess unless it is pushed through Committee by the end of June and then through Report and up to the other place by the end of July. It is not the duty of hon. Members to facilitate the passage of legislation by obeying the wishes of the Government, simply because the Government wish to push through a piece of legislation in a specified time scale.</p>
<p>I used to study political theory, although I have not done so for a long time, and I used to read about the concept of elective dictatorships. I cannot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
remember who wrote the book entitled " Elective Dictatorship ", but the notion has been widely discussed, and the term has been used in different contexts. The Government are behaving increasingly like an elective dictatorship because they have a majority and can automatically get their business through the House. They have the majority and feel that they can ignore and ride roughshod over the interests of hon. Members and the House. When the vote is called and the bells ring, they have an automatic majority. Even Governments with such a majority should not behave like that. They will pay a penalty for it eventually. People spot what they are doing. They see that they are railroading legislation through and are imposing their will without any attempt to seek consensus.</p>
<p>The House needs a modest degree of consensus in order to function. Although the Opposition bitterly oppose the Bill and have carried out and will continue to carry out a detailed scrutiny of parts of it, we have done so in an affable and amiable spirit. The Minister has introduced a sour note into our proceedings by attempting to impose a sittings motion upon us. It is part and parcel of the elective dictatorship which is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>There is, however, another reason why the Government want to impose a sittings motion. I have thought about the Minister's motives, and presumably he wants the Bill out of Committee by the end of the month so that it fits into the Government's timetable; it can be dealt with in July in the House, go through the other place and be back in time to be enacted in this Session of Parliament. But the other reason was revealed yesterday when the writ for Brecon and Radnor was moved.</p>
<p>The Minister wants to campaign in Brecon and Radnor in the last week of the by-election campaign. He may not find too much oil there, but he may want to explore the possibilities. It is a beautiful constituency. Those of us who turn aside such party considerations of working in Brecon and Radnor to achieve a victory are willing to stay here in Committee to work on the Bill even into July, even when party might demand that some of us knock on doors in Brecon and Radnor. I have a sneaking suspicion that the Minister wants to go down there to contribute to his party's defeat. That is the other reason why the sittings motion has been moved today. The Minister needs to make a much better case for the sittings motion. My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) and I have exposed the reasons why we should not support it.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said, it is no part of the Opposition's role to facilitate the Government's legislative programme. Although my right hon. and hon. Friends and I do not oppose the Bill, the Opposition cannot be relied on to assist the Government's general programme of legislation, many parts of which the alliance totally opposes. I shall therefore not support the sittings motion. Nevertheless, this is a Bill which we should debate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
constructively and critically and I therefore limit my remarks to those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael J. Martin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Sutherland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members like me have many pressures put on them. Those pressures seem increasingly to have become part of the parliamentary way of life. As a Scottish Member, I am obliged not only to attend to the business of this and any other Committee I am put on to but to take part in the parliamentary proceedings relating to Scottish legislation. Thus I am often required to take part in debates—or be prepared to take part in debates—on Scottish legislation. I obviously have to be prepared and do some research on those matters.<br><br>
The Government have not made it easy for Scottish Members. We have had numerous problems relating to the recent rating revaluation. Not only have we to be in the Chamber when the Secretary of State for Scotland makes statements about bringing forward emergency legislation, but, because of the deplorable situation in Scotland, our presence there is required by many organisations. We cannot be in the House and listen to our constituents at the same time.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The pressure put on Scottish Members makes it all the harder for us to follow the Committee's proceedings. Our position is made no easier by the Minister telling us that he intends to bulldoze the Bill through Committee. But that is not the only pressure that is put on us. Private legislation can be introduced in Scotland at any time, and, if it is opposed, Parliamentary Commissioners are required to hear the case for and against it. That means that at any time at least two Scottish Members may be required to go, say, to Edinburgh or to Peterhead.<br><br>
It is absolute cheek for a Minister to try to force legislation through the House before we have a chance to examine employment prospects or the lack of them. The Minister knows quite well that almost every Scottish constituency has been hit by redundancies because of Government legislation. I am sorry that I could not attend Tuesday's sitting. I had to go to my constituency, because of a decision a few weeks ago to reduce the personnel of British Rail Engineering Ltd—the only railway engineering workshop left in Scotland—from 1,600 to 400 or 450. The shop stewards had said to me, " Michael, we would like to see you to discuss the problem. We know that there is a study going on into the future of our work force." No reasonable Member of Parliament could refuse to go and see those men, who, in all probability, will be signing on the dole this time next year. But extending our sittings will make it even more difficult for hon. Members like me to be conscientious constituency Members as well as conscientious Members of the House.<br><br>
Something has to give. We cannot go on dividing our loyalties in all directions. A few years ago it might be said that factory closures and redundancies did not happen every day. But in my constituency the whisky industry has been badly hit every day since the turn of the year. The Distillers Company
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
—to which the Government give millions of pounds in grant—recently shed 400 employees in my constituency and moved a plant. That was not because of a fall in sales; in fact they were increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is perfectly legitimate for the hon. Member to make this point in relation to the necessity for him to be present in his constituency, but he is going rather further than that. However important these issues are, they are not terribly relevant to the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely mentioned them to highlight the fact that, like other hon. Members, I have to be away, and it will not be easy. If the Minister wants afternoon sittings, he must be prepared to sit through the night. The Minister will not like that, nor will his hon. Friends.<br><br>
Once a Scottish Member misses the sleeper leaving Euston at 11.30 pm, there is not much point in doing anything other than staying here in Committee. I warn the Minister that if I miss that sleeper, he had better prepare himself to stay at least until the 7 am plane leaves Heathrow airport. The Minister cannot smugly come here, bulldoze the legislation through, and get off with it lightly.<br><br>
I know that Ministers get complaints from their Back Benchers. They will not say much here in Committee, because they have been told to keep quiet, but out in the Corridor they will grab the Minister by the scruff of his neck and tell him that he had better come to some arrangement so that they will not be kept from their beds. Many of them represent marginal seats, and if they do not get back to their constituencies to explain what the Government are doing on behalf of the people of this country, they will have a lot of trouble.<br><br>
I noticed that the other day the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Terlezki) was entertaining a large number of people to champagne dinners and lunches on the Terrace. He will not be able to do that if he supports the sittings motion; the entertaining will be over, and he will be back here. The hon. Gentleman will not be able to nurse his marginal seat—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very marginal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stefan Terlezki <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very winnable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very winnable if the hon. Member is feeding delegates with champagne.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we can leave the question of entertainment and return to the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we pass the sittings motion, it will mean discomfort and problems for hon. Members on both sides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been assured that the Minister is a very reasonable man. So one would expect him now to withdraw the motion. Obviously, I had the wrong information, and he is not a reasonable man.<br><br>

We need to consider why we are doing what we are doing this morning in curtailing debate and preventing Opposition Members from discussing the Bill. Let us look at this Government's record since 1979. In local government, they have introduced ill-conceived legislation with the intention of frustrating the people. What legislation they have passed has been proved wrong. Conservative Ministers—not this Minister—have rushed forward to rectify mistakes that have been made because of insufficient time. One cannot think rationally if one goes without sleep night after night. The mistakes are shown up time and again when further legislation is introduced to correct the first lot.<br><br>
I was in the German Democratic Republic last week, along with a Conservative Member. That country does not believe in rushing through legislation. It believes in long-term planning, which is alien to our Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the polices of the GDR have anything to do with the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to compare the logic and common sense of the debates in the GDR and the illogical policies pursued by our Government. With careful deliberation and discussion, we can devise beneficial policies. If the Minister seeks to rush through the legislation, we shall not be able to raise important points. The appointment of Ian MacGregor is a typical example of the Government's lack of long-term policy.<br><br>
The Bill is ill-conceived and should be carefully considered. Will the Minister tell us the long-term benefits of rushing through this legislation? I hope that he will give thought to the need for careful discussions and long-term planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence Cunliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leigh)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I enter the debate a little reluctantly. There seems to have been a lack of communication through the usual channels, and some confusion about whether we can plan a rational, sensible approach on the Bill. I have had the maximum co-operation from the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant), since I returned to the country. But I was somewhat surprised because I wrongly anticipated that our Committee proceedings would not start until after the Easter recess, and it was agreed that some of my hon. Friends could be on other duties. Some of us therefore did not appear on the Committee until Tuesday of this week.<br><br>
Many of us will remember that the veterans of the Committee which considered Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Bill were able to devise a sensible timetable which led to the maximum examination of every detail of that Bill. I had asumed that both sides of the Committee would approach this Bill with the same spirit of co-operation.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn (Mr. Martin) has outlined the problems of conflicting loyalties. It is a Whip's job to accommodate hon. Members who have problems as far as it is practical to do so. Most hon. Members regard it as

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
a job that must be done with compassion and understanding. The function of Whips is to co-operate sensibly with the parties involved in legislation after full examination of the issues. I am glad to say that we approach the Bill in that spirit.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The Government have sought to steamroller the legislation through rather more quickly than we expected. Of course, it is the Government's job to legislate as quickly as possible, but judgment is needed in accelerating the business while having regard to expediency and the wish of the executive. The Government Whip and I share the problem of trying to satisfy hon. Members as well as our executives. It is a difficult task, but we try to do it to the best of our ability.<br><br>
I do not think that it is unreasonable to oppose the sittings motion on the basis that the records show that the average time taken before the machinery is moving and a Bill gets into Committee is three months. The Minister pointed out that the Bill was introduced in March and, after only seven weeks' preparation, it arrived in Committee. It will now proceed through its various stages until it reaches the statute book.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) conscientiously, from time to time, plays the devil's advocate. Sometimes he uses the Lone Ranger style and adopts an aura of ministerial authority. There is no doubt that his expertise and long experience make a valuable contribution to energy policies. This legislation is an element of energy policy that the hon. Gentleman has reservations about. If he thinks that the Committee are to be deprived of a full debate, especially on clause 2, I am sure that he will support us when we vote.<br><br>
Regardless of the vote, and even though we cannot understand the Government's stance, we shall try to ensure that in the time available the Bill is examined in an amicable, courteous and sensible way. We believe that the Bill can proceed to Report stage only if such an approach is adopted.<br><br>
When we vote on the sittings motion, I hope that some of the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friends will be noted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I tell the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) that I was delighted to hear his commitment to keep the quorum on Thursday nights. If we sit past 11.30 pm, when the train leaves Euston, I shall be able to rely on him to help to keep the Committee going. I shall bear his commitment in mind, as will my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant).<br><br>
I am disappointed in the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace). I am as anxious as he is to take Scottish school holidays into account. The hon. Member for Springburn did not mention that factor, but in his heart of hearts he may wish to have a word with me outside later to ensure that we finish in time to allow him to enjoy his holidays. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, having quite rightly put forward a sen
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
sible, practical argument that affects certain Members of the House, is not prepared to carry his convictions so far as to support the motion. I know that he is as anxious as I am that the Bill should be properly debated. Our overall time is limited, and I hope that the motion will give us more opportunity for debate within that limited time.<br><br>
Perhaps before we come to vote on the motion the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland will reconsider the decision that he expressed in a commendably brief speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that if all hon. Members were as succinct as I tried to be, we could get the Bill through without the sittings motion? Could we not in that way consider the Bill constructively and properly without sitting in the afternoons?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Gentleman's intervention my whole-hearted support, as I hope he will shortly give me his.<br><br>
Congratulations must be reserved for the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), the only Opposition Member to have succeeded in emptying his side of the Committee during our proceedings. I am impressed by the good attendance of Opposition Members this morning when we are discussing the sittings motion and not the substance of the Bill. We have heard a greater variety of speeches today. On previous occasions the Opposition have kept two hon. Members on their side of the Committee, speaking regularly. I make no comments on the quality of the speeches we have heard so far, but the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney succeeded in reducing the average of two to one. It surprised me that that should have happened in what is apparently regarded as an important debate on an important motion.<br><br>
I sympathise with the hon. Member for Spring-burn over the extra work of Scottish Members, but it is not new. I can remember when I first came into the House, the locomotive workshop at Inverurie was to be closed, one of the first to be so. Although it was not in my constituency, I was involved as it fell within that of my neighbour to the north. A Labour Government were in office then, if I recollect correctly, although I shall not stray by commenting on that. The case was ably represented by the then Liberal Member of Parliament for that constituency, but, as our part of Scotland was affected, other hon. Members reacted vigorously. I was a member of Scottish and other Committees and had also to continue with my work in the House of Commons, on the Floor of the House and in its Committees, while at the same time playing my part over the closure of the railway workshop.<br><br>
It may sometimes be difficult to do so, but we all have to make choices on how to spend our time, and having gone through an identical experience some years ago I do not want to make it too difficult for the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he will be as successful as I was in making the best use of his time.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be a signatory to a petition to keep BREL open?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not pursue that line of thought as it does not appear to be relevant to the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be tempted. I found the attitude of Opposition Front Bench spokesmen slightly paradoxical. At one moment the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) was calling me courteous, and at another he was calling me contemptuous. He should make up his mind. The Opposition have not clarified their own thoughts.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is having this difficulty in going to bed with the participation agreements, is it not better to stay up through the night, when perhaps I shall be able to help with his study of them? He may be able to understand more quickly what is involved, which will save him from wrestling with himself—I presume it is with himself—during these long watches. Perhaps afternoon sittings will assist him to understand these important issues more quickly and fully than if we continued meeting only in the mornings. It had not anticipated that they would help the hon. Gentleman in such a personal way. That gives added weight to my request for the Committee to accept the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will not be aware, but he has demonstrated the classic symptoms of schizophrenia, which illustrates the apparent contradiction he has seen in my speech.<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister not only to reduce the manifestations of this sad condition, but to try to avoid touching on the borders of depravity as he did a moment ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that if I was tempted, I was merely following the example of his speech and the speeches of his hon. Friends.<br><br>
I do not think that we are being unreasonable, having had some good debates, in putting forward this motion at our fifth sitting. Nothing that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said convinced me that we should do otherwise. As he thought that it was inappropriate to start to deal with the Bill in June, let me remind him that in Committee on the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975, introduced by the then Labour Government, a motion was introduced to sit in the afternoons as well as in the mornings. In the debate on 10 June 1975 Mr. Varley, the Secretary of State for Energy said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is nothing unusual about it." —[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 10 June 1975; c.252.]</p></blockquote>
The record of the vote in column 275 shows the name of the Right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), who voted for the motion to sit in the afternoon. I hope that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney will have a word with his own leader about this matter.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
The decision about the Bill was taken in March. We started the Second Reading in May and the Committee stage five sittings ago. The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 had its Second Reading on 30 April 1975. At the fifth Committee sitting on 10 June the then Secretary of State for Energy introduced his sittings motion in terms almost identical to mine.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There were 40 or so clauses in that Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The utter inconsistency of Opposition Members—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon Members must not make loud remarks from sedentary positions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are showing their schizophrenia.

Members to support the motion.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister interrupted us with his motion we were about to embark upon a serious debate but first I must tell him that I look forward to the tutorials on participation agreements. I warn him that occasionally the pupil can teach the tutor a few things, but when we discuss participation agreements we shall see how much the Minister needs to teach me about them and how skilfully and briefly he can do it.<br><br>
I am reluctant to rise, because of my impact on the Committee. I have retained the interest of most of my colleagues so far and I hope that I can retain the interest of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo). He told us that the amendments in the names of himself and the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) were paving amendments for privatisation—or at least that was the theory in principle.<br><br>
I was interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Southgate and I have had a chance to think about them since our previous sitting. The whole gist of his argument clearly comes from the Peter-house school of history and political thought, which is notoriously the last bastion of Right-wing historical and political thought. He has obviously been influenced by the likes of Maurice Cowling. 1 have not read my Maurice Cowling for several years but I remember disagreeing with most of what he wrote. Dean Edward Norman is also of that college, as are all the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> people. Edward Norman has the distinction of being on the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> for a whole 12 months without managing to get one word in the paper, which is a record. The hon. Member for Southgate could do better than that.<br><br>
The remarks of the hon. Member for Southgate were interesting because of their curious, unthinking ideology that everything in the private sector was good and that everything in the public sector was inevitably bad. He did not produce any evidence in relation to the pipelines to justify that observation. It seems to be a curious automatic reaction—almost mechanistic. The hon. Gentleman does not argue the case. There is not much historical evidence to prove that everything in the private sector works and that everything in the public sector does not. The assumption that the hon. Member for Southgate was making was that because the pipelines were in the public sector they were probably inefficiently managed and that if they were transferred to the private sector they would almost inevitably become successful and profitable.<br><br>
We shall examine shortly what the pipeline system does, how it has been managed and how it should be managed. I shall not dwell too much on how it should be managed because I recall the observation that you made on Tuesday, Mr. Knox, about not covering the same ground in different sets of amendments. I have tabled a new clause which deals with the future development of the pipeline system. I shall therefore limit my remarks today to the past and the present.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Southgate made no case, based on any historical evidence, to justify the transfer of the system from the public to the private
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
sector except that in an ideological and moral absolutist way he believes that everything in the private sector is good and that everything in the public sector is bad. That is the Cambridge, Peterhouse school of thought. It is a rather poor form of historical analysis. It does not appear to be based much on information. I was brought up as an historian. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman read history at Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo </span><span class='membercontribution'><i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I studied history too. But I was brought up in the Namier school of history. The great influence on my historical writing—the little that I have done and that which I am trying to do when I am not interrupted by pipeline Bills—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could return to the Bill, interesting though his discourse about his education and that of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was drawing upon that because the philosophy behind the hon. Gentleman's remarks, the amendment that he moved and the way in which he moved it was based on the attitude which pervades the college where he was educated. Historians brought up in the Namier school of history believe in trying to know as much as possible about a system and then seeing what conclusions and perhaps lessons can be drawn from it. But one starts by knowing as much as possible about the event, hapening or whatever. The Namier school of history is obviously in complete contrast to that of Cambridge, Peterhouse which makes a series of statements and does not relate them much either to evidence or information.<br><br>
There was little evidence or information in the hon. Gentleman's speech. He admitted that he had been caught slightly by surprise. Yet the amendment was in his name and had been tabled for a little while. He admitted that he had had difficulty in finding anything about it.<br><br>
The other distinction between the Merthyr Cyfartha comprehensive and Peterhouse, Cambridge is that we were brought up in a rather old fashioned way to try to do our homework. I have tried to do my homework on the pipeline system. It is imperfect and—this is an area where I agree with the hon. Gentleman—the purpose of the amendments is to learn much more about it. I hope that the Minister will be as informative as possible and will not shelter behind any arguments that state secrets are involved in the system, certainly not in relation to the questions posed by the hon. Member and those that I shall pose.<br><br>
Let us turn to what we can find out about the pipeline system. The House has notoriously neglected this development. One has to search hard in <i>Hansard</i> to find a meaningful discussion of the system in recent years; although I have eventually discovered how to work out its finances. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that unfortunately even BNOC's annual report is sketchy in its assessment of the performance of the pipelines storage system.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
May I try to educate the hon. Member for Southgate on the system. I drew attention to the work of reference that I used last week. Mr. A. L. Adams used to be in charge of the system at BNOC and has produced an interesting description of it. I think that he has now retired. His description is based on 1980, so an update is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend stress the point that this work by Mr. Adams is of immense interest and importance, but that it was written in 1980 and all members of the Committee would be grateful if the Minister could provide us with details from that date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps you can advise me, Mr. Knox, whether it is in order for the Opposition to ask the Minister to put on the table the detailed accounts and an update of the information that he has on the pipelines system? Is it in order for the Opposition to put photostat copies of Mr. Adams' work on the table, as it would help the Committee in its discussion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that no documents are formally tabled and that there is nothing to stop any member of the Committee handing documents to whomsoever he wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Knox, for that advice. I understand that it would not be out of order if Mr Adams' work were photocopied and laid on the Table in the Committee Room for the benefit of hon. Members. I shall try to do that by next Tuesday.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Southgate said that he thought that the system might have hundreds of miles of pipeline. There are more than 1,000 miles of oil pipeline stretching through the country.<br><br>
I have often thought that presentations should be made to Standing Comimttees. I want to draw the Committee's attention to the map of the system, as I shall refer to parts of it. It shows a basic rectangle stretching from Stanlow across to Leeds, near Immingham, and then coming south to Aldermaston and then across to Bristol. There is a link between Stanlow, Liverpool and Bristol. It is a rectangle with important spurs, and there are interesting spurs into East Anglia.<br><br>
When I studied the system I was sad to find how it discriminated against Scotland and Wales. There is not one pipeline into the Principality. There used to be a storage system at Milford Haven and Port Talbot, but they have both been closed down, as has so much else in the Principality. There is nothing connecting the North sea and Scotland with the pipeline system. Our lack of vigilance has let down the Scots and the Welsh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon. Gentleman is going into details, can he tell us how much of the pipeline is operated under contract to private companies, and what percentage of the total is private pipelines?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer some of the hon. Gentleman's questions, but my information—perhaps, even, my homework—on that subject is somewhat deficient. Like the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, I hope that we can use this debate to find the answers to those basic questions. However, I shall have a crack at answering part of what the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) asked. It is a bit unfair on the Opposition to have to produce all this information, but I am game to try.<br><br>
I shall start with what I know. I know that there is more than 1,000 miles of pipeline, and it stretches in a rectangular fashion, covering parts of England and East Anglia, and then comes down to the south coast. In addition to that length of pipeline, the system—as Mr. Adams described it—has about 30 major storage sites, which I understand are old-fashioned storage tanks, and there are also a number of salt cavities, where it is possible to store about 2 million tonnes of petrol and petrol product reserves. Perhaps the Minister will confirm those figures.<br><br>
I do not know whether I can give the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North all the information that he seeks, but if not, we can work on it and try to find out by next Tuesday. I know from Mr. Adams' lecture on the pipeline installation system that the cost of replacing it—this is something that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said that we did not know—would be about £500 million. Again, I hope that the Minister will confirm that. I am always chary about quoting figures because I am not very numerate.<br><br>
It is interesting to know why the pipeline system was built and why it is where it is. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate mused on that subject, but said little. Its origin lies in strategy—strategic reserves—and national security. Mr Adams said that the system began in the nick of time before the second world war, when Whitehall planners and policy makers became increasingly worried and frightened about the prospect of a war with no strategic reserve of petroleum and oil products, particularly for fighter aircraft such as the Spitfire. It was a very close shave. In 1936, they began to build up the reserve, in a Munich-style, appeasement attitude, but it was not until quite late in the day that people recognised the need for a strategic reserve system.<br><br>
In 1936, before the system was built, the military planners found that they had only 8,000 tons of fuel and fuel spirit—equivalent to what they thought was 10 days' war consumption. This is very relevant to what the hon. Member for Southgate asked about on Tuesday. In fact, it turned out to be only one day's supply of fuel and petrol products to oil the military machine.<br><br>
Quite late in the day, the Whitehall planners decided that they needed a strategic storage system. In 1936, they began to build up a reserve. They calculated that they needed a reserve facility of 90,000 tons. The Air Ministry decided in August
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
1936 that it needed at least 290,000 tons of strategic reserves and it started building storage tanks at aviation distribution depots—AFDDs. There were no sittings motions in those days—everyone got on with the job, as the Opposition are trying to do now.<br><br>
The Whitehall planners then realised that storage tanks would not be much use in war time because they could be knocked out by aircraft. Therefore, they built the most remarkable pipeline system, which I have briefly described to the Committee. It was a buried or semi-buried system, which connected the storage tanks and provided a means of distribution for the petrol.<br><br>
As a matter of need and policy, the fuel system had to be outside major urban areas in order to protect it. It was not to serve obvious points of commercial development. It was built to a deliberate strategic plan in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first line went from Avonmouth, Bristol through Aldermaston to Walton-on-Thames, as far away from the risk of immediate attack as possible. It needed to serve the major concentration of airfields in the south east, but it was nevertheless away from the south east.<br><br>
As we were importing oil, the planners then realised that they could not have a system from only one port and they started the next major system in Stanlow, Cheshire. I have lived next door to the system in Eastham, which has had an oil dock for some time. I played for a good cricket team there. That link went to the Humber. It provided an alternative source of supply and was again away from the risk of immediate air attack.<br><br>
The system was built up in a remarkable way. It went south from Stanlow through Misterton and Sawtry. Two major east-west links were then built. Stanlow to Misterton served the East Anglia fields with oil from the Liverpool Cheshire ports. The system was then linked to the south east coast to Ramble and Fawley down to the Isle of Wight.<br><br>
Some people who have read their history books may know about the system. It was before my time, though I do not know how old the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North was when this was happening. A major link was planned to Cherbourg, the famous Pluto—the pipeline under the ocean scheme —to link Cherbourg to fuel submarines. That was one of the failures of planning, and was never utilised as the original planner thought about it.<br><br>
In taking the Committee around the pipeline system, I aim to answer the hon. Gentleman's points. Whatever its purpose may have been, it still has a strategic national security function as opposed to just a commercial one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has just admitted that he has been taking the Committee around this problem, but he has also been taking us around the amendment, so I hope that he will get nearer to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment removes this system, so we should know what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a reason for going on at any further length about the history of it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Its purpose is historical. One does not understand the system unless one understands why it was built and knows where it is. That should be perfectly reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is perfectly reasonable, but the hon. Gentleman must not go on at excessive length about it or he will be guilty of repetition, which I know he would not wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that I had been repetitive. I was progressing along the system rather than being repetitive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a point for my hon. Friend which could satisfy the Chair and be of help to the Committee. Before 1936, security was safely or questionably—depending on one's view—in the hands of the private sector. The task of providing fuel for the Royal Air Force, which underlies this matter, rested with the private sector. The state decided that that was not good enough, and that national security required public involvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend summarises it beautifully. The system was built by the state for state reasons. Although I do not want to offend you further, Mr. Knox, it is important to know what happened to the system after its war-time use, as that is the basis on which it functions now.<br><br>
After the war, the system was put on a care and maintenance basis and became fairly disused. It was filled with water and carried virtually no fuel through. With the post war euphoria—or relief—that this was the war to end all wars, it was thought that there was no further need for it.<br><br>
However, with the cold war, after the building of the Berlin wall and the concern of many people that there could be another war, the system was revived. The hon. Member for Southgate did not refer to the start of the American presence in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
With the development of United States Air Force bases in the 1950s, the system was rejuvenated and revived, to serve not only the United Kingdom defence establishment, but the needs of the United States, who came on an agreement to establish air force bases.<br><br>
In the 1950s, in place of the system that was closed down on a care and maintenance basis, we had a system that had been rejuvenated for a new strategic function, serving not only our own Air Force bases but the new American Air Force bases—particularly in East Anglia.<br><br>
The system was revived, a new line built from Stanlow to Rawcliffe linking to the Humber at Immingham, allowing it to be served from that port. What is more important is that as the system was redeveloped and modernised, pressure pumping was installed to produce a two-way flow.<br><br>
The system was revived for an additional strategic purpose and at the same time made more flexible.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
I come to an aspect discussed by the hon. Member for Southgate and it is one that we must explore on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
the amendments. Discussions took place about using the pipeline system for commercial purposes, to minimise the cost and finance the strategic use. Previous commercial use had been modest. I believe that Regent Oil made a modest commercial arrangement with Avonmouth, which is one of the reasons for the interesting link from. Stanlow to Bristol and Avonmouth. However, the great commercial expansion occurred when Fawley and the Isle of Grain major refineries came on stream in the 1950s.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This question may be premature, and if it is, I am sure that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) will be coming to the matter in due course.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of the revival of the pipeline for strategic reasons following the arrival of United States bases in this country. How does he see the future of the pipeline developing if his party's policy of removing United States nuclear bases from this country is implemented?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to deal with that question at length, but I feel that you might start to give me withering looks, Mr. Knox. However, I shall answer briefly. We plan to remove United States nuclear bases, but not all their bases are nuclear. There is a non-nuclear American Air Force presence in this country, and Labour party defence policy would not affect the need to supply the petrol requirements of those bases.<br><br>
I fear that if I go much further, you will look askance at me, Mr. Knox. Vibes are coming from the Chair, but that is my short answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace).<br><br>
The great commercial development of the pipeline occurred with the development of Conoco's refining interest in the United Kingdom and the leasing in 1967 of a site near Sheffield and Immingham linking these important comercial and strategic parts of the pipeline system from Rawcliffe to Immingham and the Humber.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The pipeline may be one of the few economic assets of south Yorkshire that has not been devastated by the present Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to draw that fact to the Committee's attention. The Government might have closed the pipeline, or tried to privatise it, and I shall come to that shortly.<br><br>
The rejuvenation of the pipelines in the 1960s, partly for strategic reasons, to serve the American Air Force bases—particularly in East Anglia—and partly as a result of the new two-way capacity, encouraged those running the pipeline system to look for commercial uses for it.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Southgate and for Bedfordshire, North asked a perfectly reasonable question that I cannot wholly answer. The hon. Member for Southgate asked how much use was made of the system and he quoted from BNOC's annual report. I hope that the Minister will give us such information, which we desperately need.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
I have gleaned from Mr. Adams' account, which described the system in 1980-81, that almost all of it is in use, to some degree, for either military or comercial purposes. It is obviously in use, but the hon. Member for Southgate properly asked how much it was used. The Minister would not reveal any state secrets if he told us.<br><br>
In the 1960s and 1970s, and especially in the five-year plan that was coming to an end when Mr. Adams wrote, here was a major refurbishment of the system. I do not know when the five-year plan started—I hope that the Minister will tell us—and I do not know when it was concluded. New clause 2 suggests a new five-year plan. I shall not dwell on it now, because I can do so when we discuss the new clause.<br><br>
If the amendment of the hon. Member for Southgate were accepted the pipelines system would be removed from the agency's responsibilities. I am not sure where it would go if it were not given to the agency and if BNOC were abolished. I presume that it would revert to the Department of Energy. The pipelines system has been virtually relaid because of the five-year plan of the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br><br>
The assets transferred under the clause to the agency include not only the pipelines and storage system with more than 30 storage centres, but major rebuilt and renovated control stations. There is one at Aldermaston, one at Saffron Walden and another at Rawcliffe, near Goole. The three major centres are modernised and, I presume, computerised, and they control this remarkable pipelines system. The Bill would transfer responsibility for the system to the agency.<br><br>
Mr. Adams concluded his lecture by saying that we have created—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is still going on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been warned about sedentary interruptions. If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene I shall be happy to give way.<br><br>
Mr. Adams described the completed system in 1980-81 as " very flexible ", with
<br><blockquote><p>"a high degree of versatility in its ability to distribute both commercial and strategic supplies."</p></blockquote>
I do not know Mr. Adams' political views; I am only quoting his report. We are discussing assets of considerable commercial and strategic importance. They deserve the attention that we shall give them as we debate the amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North also asked how the system was operated and pointed out that it was operated through agents. The system belongs to the state, although I thought that the hon. Gentleman implied that it belonged to someone else. No doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but the system belongs to the Government. It is. a Crown asset. The operating agents are a number of oil companies. They manage and operate the system from the division which is now with BNOC and which will be transferred to the agency. 'But, for good reasons, these are national assets—state assets.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is developing an interesting argument. But surely he remembers that in 1939, when the state did not have assets, it requisitioned them under the defence regulations. If the state had no interest in the system, would not it be open to it to requisition pipelines?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that the state can requisition anything in time of war. But no commercial pipeline system existed then; the private sector had not served the national strategic interest. The state built the system, and it has been maintaned for strategic reasons. We must now decide whether those reasons are still applicable. The hon. Member for Southgate seemed to be asking whether the system was still of any strategic need—the hon. Gentleman shakes his head; perhaps I misread him. However, he did ask about the function of a strategic as opposed to a commercial system. I shall try to tell the Committee what I have found out, but I should also like the Minister to reply to such an important question.<br><br>
I hope to refute everything that the hon. Member for Southgate has said. The present system is a public asset which fulfils both a commercial and a strategic role. It is flexible, modernised and capable of expansion. That strikes us as a good combination and an example of public enterprise which, while it aims to be a commercial success, also remains part and parcel of our national strategic safeguards. Even the most fervent privatiser would accept that the state has a responsibility to maintain the nation's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
strategic requirements, especially if it can offset the costs through commercial success. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chair man</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are you calling me to order, Mr. Knox?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was calling to order some hon. Members who were engaged in a rather noisy conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your protection, Mr. Knox, although I can always raise my voice a little.<br><br>
The Minister promised to be my tutor on participation agreements, but some members of the Committee obviously do not wish to be tutored in other subjects. Those poor pupils also show a curious disregard for national security. The hon. Member for Southgate seemed to suggest that we should privatise anything that moves. I think that this lot would privatise their grandmothers if they thought that there was any short-term advantage in doing so. Certainly they have seriously thought of privatising the pipeline system, and I now hope to explain as cogently as possible why they did not.</span></p>
