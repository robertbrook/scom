WARNING NOTICES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>8.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 916, in page 170, line 35, leave out 'subsection (5)' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'the proposed action on the person to whom the warning notice is given'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 156, in page 171, line 7, leave out 'on which it relied' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'relating to the matters covered by the warning notice'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to clause 338 and part XXIV, which deals with the specifications of the warning notices. It sets out the mechanisms for dealing with third parties, time limits for making representations and so on.<br><br>
Under the clause, the authority must allow the person to whom a warning notice is given to have access to the evidence. However, the way in which the clause is written allows the Financial Services Authority to say that it will disclose only the selected papers on which it relied. That is not good enough. The recipient should have access to all the evidence that is relevant to the case. That is the intention behind amendment No. 156.<br><br>
On amendment No. 916, the warning notice should make it clear to the recipient exactly what the proposed action will be; it should not refer simply to the effect of subsection (5).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Kidney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the hon. Gentleman's intention, but is he aware that deleting subsection (5) would mean that people who were the subject of action would receive no notice of their right to have access to the papers on which the case against them was built? Is the hon. Gentleman aware of that unintended consequence of the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are looking to replace subsection (5) with a reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed action on the person to whom the warning notice is given."</p></blockquote>
Our amendment contains a more detailed description than subsection (5). I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's description of the consequences of the amendments.<br><br>
This is an important part of the Bill. The warning notices are an important part of the enforcement procedure, and the amendments will make the provision slightly fairer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Part XXIV is important. Security lawyers have made substantial representations to the Treasury and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1216</span>
Conservative party about it. It deals with the proper separation of the judge, prosecutor and jury. There are some subtle but important points that the Government would be wise to consider if they are to get this primary legislation right. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) has already spoken to our amendments, and I shall return to other issues in the stand part debate.<br><br>
I shall summarise the territories covered by the clause. First, people who are being prosecuted should have provided to them all the evidence that is held against them so that they can defend themselves. Secondly, there should be clear separation between the parties within the FSA, not just between the prosecutor and judge. The person who carried out the research into the allegations should be separate from the person who decides what to disclose to the tribunal. Finally, when the FSA issues a decision notice, there should not be any phase of enforcement until the proper period of review has passed.<br><br>
Our two amendments would ensure that the person prosecuted has the full evidence disclosed to him and, secondly, that the proposed penalty is made clear to the person being prosecuted. Although we are nearing the end of our debates on the Bill in Committee, we feel strongly that the Government should take on board certain matters, even if they do not accept our amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentlemans for their explanation of the amendments. There is little between us, but I should like to respond to the points that have been raised. It is not right to replace the requirement under subsection (1)(c) to set out the arrangements for access to evidence with a requirement to set out the proposed action, because various provisions in other parts of the Bill already do that. For example, clause 178(2) and (3) deal with warning notices when a public censure or financial penalty is proposed. Similarly, clause 100(2) covers financial penalties for market abuse and clause 335(2) refers to the power to require an authorised person to pay restitution under clause 334.<br><br>
However, it is right to require the FSA to give a formal indication of a person's right of access under subsection (5) to evidence that might inform his decision whether to make representations and, if so, what those representations may cover. I understand the Opposition's arguments that some wider right of access to evidence should be granted, although the test that they propose of—
<br><blockquote><p>"evidence relating to matters covered by the warning notice"</p></blockquote>
seems rather too broad.<br><br>
We must bear it in mind that the FSA is a supervisor as well as an investigating authority, and may hold a large amount of evidence in relation to an authorised person that could be said to relate to a matter that is covered by a notice without being especially germane to it. It might be rather bureaucratic and unhelpful if the FSA were required to arrange access to all the information that it might hold that might be said in a loose sense to relate to a matter covered by a warning notice. However, as I said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0301">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1217</span>
when we discussed clause 140, we considered the case that the Law Society made for broadening the right of access, and in broad terms we are persuaded that a case can be made for aligning the requirement more closely to the rules on disclosure that apply in criminal cases.<br><br>
Further work needs to be done in refining those ideas, but we have in mind a provision that would require the FSA to provide access to evidence that it has considered and on which it does not propose to rely, but which it believes could materially undermine its case. That would prevent the FSA from relying on particular expert witness statements while withholding other expert witness statements that were less favourable to its case. Such a provision should meet Opposition Members' substantive anxieties. However, several further issues may arise, including the best way to deal with public interest immunity and legal privilege. We must carefully consider the drafting to avoid unwanted knock-on effects in other areas.<br><br>
We are also inclined to include a comparable right of access following the issuing of a decision notice. Just as people require access to evidence in order to consider whether to make representations, they may also need access to evidence in order to consider whether to refer the matter to a tribunal, especially if they have not opted to exercise their right at the first stage. In addition, because we believe that third parties implicated in a warning notice should have some rights to see the relevant evidence, we shall introduce amendments to broaden the right of access under the clause and to reproduce it under the next clause.<br><br>
I have tried to give a reasonably full response to the amendments. This debate, like the Law Society's input, has been very useful and will be reflected in our proposals. I hope that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Bedfordshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to what the Economic Secretary said. It would obviously be relevant in a clause stand part debate and to subsequent clauses.<br><br>
There seems to have been a misunderstanding and a belief that our suggestion is that subsection (5) should be removed. That would not be the effect of the amendment; rather, we suggest that "subsection (5)" should be removed and substituted with the words—
<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed action on the person to whom the warning notice is given".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would merely make the clause specify that a warning notice must describe the effect of the proposed action on the person to whom the warning notice is given. It is a simple suggestion that, in an area of technicality, the FSA should explain in straightforward language why it is issuing the warning.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary gave a lot of useful answers in relation to subsection (5). I should like to tease those out, but I think that it would be more appropriate to do so in a clause stand part debate. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding about the effect of the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1218</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for making that last point, because the Government have misconstrued the purpose of the two amendments. We are encouraged, however, to find that the Economic Secretary is considering broadening rights of access and perhaps making them parallel to those available in criminal cases. She made some relevant points about conflicting expert witnesses and the FSA's discretion to use some and not others. It is only right, therefore, that such supporting evidence should be made available if it is not used. I accept her point about knock-on effects in other areas. On the basis that she agrees with our anxieties and that the matter is being investigated, I am content not to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary confirm that the Government also agree with the point made in amendment No. 916? I am happy with her reply to amendment No. 156, but I am not sure whether the Government agree that, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell) said, it is sensible for the proposed action to be explained to the person to whom the warning is given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is right about that. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire referred to a misunderstanding about deleting the phrase "subsection (5)". I appreciate that only the phrase "subsection (5)" would be deleted, not the subsection itself. I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the amendment would not do that. Under the amendment, the requirement on the FSA to inform the recipients of their rights of access to the evidence would be removed. As I have said, it would not be right to replace the requirement under subsection (1)(c) to set out the arrangements for access with a requirement to set out the proposed action, because that will happen under other provisions in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendments made:</i> No. 958, in page 170, line 39, leave out from "party" to end of line 40.</p>
<p>No. 959, in clause 339, page 171, line 22, leave out from "party" to end of line 23.—[<i>Miss Melanie Johnson.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i></p>
<p>That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like a little further clarification, although the Economic Secretary largely dealt with the matter in her previous answer. The point about subsection (5) is that the authority must allow the person to whom a warning notice is given access to the evidence on which it relied in deciding its proposed action. That is fine, but our concern, which I should like assuaged, is whether an indication will be given that conflicting views may be presented to the authority at that stage.<br><br>
We are dealing with that matter in a topsy-turvy way. The Economic Secretary read a long piece of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0302">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1219</span>
helpful material during her previous answer. I understood her to say that what is described in the courts as unused material is evidence that is available to prosecutors on which they do not intend to rely, which may undermine their case or may seem to be neutral but which might be of interest to the defence. The point is whether that evidence will be revealed at the warning notice stage.<br><br>
It would be helpful if any significant unused material were disclosed at the warning notice stage because it would enable the authorised person to make representations more effectively. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, that would be especially helpful if the material included expert or market opinions that suggested that a supposed contravention was not a contravention or that it was a less serious contravention, or that there had been a misunderstanding. In a highly sensitive market, that is important because misunderstandings could be nipped in the bud. Everyone, including the Government and, I hope, the FSA, will be aware that even starting investigations, and certainly the suggestion that there may be offences, can do disproportionate damage to an authorised person. That does not mean that there must not be investigations or prosecutions, it means that such matters should be handled with care and discretion. How much material in the hands of the FSA will be disclosed at the warning notice stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for the issues that he raised. We are still working on the subject, and we undertake to bear those issues in mind when we table further amendments. However, given the details of that work, I do not think that it is possible to answer him at the moment.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 338, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

DECISION NOTICES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 918, in page 171, line 10, leave out "A decision" and insert "An enforcement".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 919, in page 172, line 7, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) issue a notice for payment or otherwise enforce a decision notice whilst the decision is open to review'.</p></blockquote>
No. 920, in page 172, line 16, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'or withdrawn'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is about decision notices. We are slightly at a loss, because we hoped that amendment No. 917 would be on the selection list for the sitting. It would have changed the clause's title from "Decision notices" to "Enforcement notices", a change that refers to whether there should formally be an enforcement committee vis-a-vis the first instance tribunal. We obviously covered that subject at length
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1220</span>
in the Burns Committee. Amendment No. 918 would change the reference from "A decision notice" to "An enforcement notice", which would have gelled with the previous amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 919, which refers to page 172, would add a new paragraph (c) to subsection (6). Our thinking was that the FSA should not try to enforce a decision notice—an enforcement notice, as we would prefer it to be called—while the decision was still open to review. That term is defined in subsection (7). The only provision in the Bill that postpones the effect of a decision notice is clause 108(5), which does so when there is reference to the tribunal. However, the Government have now twice agreed that a suspension should occur immediately, even before a case is referred to the tribunal. I hope that they will amend other clauses, such as clause 108, on the back of that.<br><br>
We have discussed at length whether the procedures should go ahead at full speed before a final decision is made as the result of a review. Consequent on that is amendment No. 920, which adds "or withdrawn" at the end of clause 339. The thrust of the clause, and the terms that go with it, is that someone will be found guilty after going through the procedures, and that an appeal may be turned down. Of course, an appeal might be withdrawn instead. We are trying to add to the definition in the clause to give a better balance, because the term "decision notice" is rather final. However, as we know from discussing other clauses, that is by no means the end of the road in relation to the final decision to be imposed on the person to whom it applies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, we have already covered some of those matters, which relate to clause 108. The process of the FSA giving notices should make absolutely clear that people in the marketplace are not deemed to be guilty before they have had a chance to prove their innocence. The Bill's tribunal arrangements are an improvement on present arrangements, and are designed to ensure that justice is done. From the language used and who can say what to whom during the period in question, it should be clear that matters are at a preliminary stage until the appeal period has expired, regardless of whether someone has appealed. The matter is subtle and tortuous, but clause 339's reference to clause 108 is not worded quite correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On amendment No. 918, I do not see any value in changing the name of a decision notice. The term "decision notice" accurately describes the notice's function to inform the other party that, having considered any representations made in response to a prior warning notice, the FSA has decided that the specified action is appropriate. That does not in any way lessen the right of the other party to have the matter referred to the tribunal and does not constrain the tribunal's consideration of the matter. The tribunal is clearly able to examine all the merits of cases referred to it as a full first-instance tribunal, as the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
Changing the name would not add anything. Indeed, it may be argued that the term "enforcement notice" is misleading as decisions covered by such a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0303">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1221</span>
procedure will not necessarily be enforcement decisions. Some will be decisions not to grant as wide a permission as has been sought and some will be decisions not to approve a certain appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am bothered by the word "decision". Presumably, once a warning notice has been issued to someone and representations have been made by that person, a decision must be taken about whether to proceed. Therefore, any reply to that is a decision notice. However, the Bill suggests that a decision notice is only given when action having the nature of a prosecution is going to proceed. If one decides to do nothing, what is that called?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it will still be called defence B. I am not sure what the right hon. and learned Gentleman's difficulty is. I have explained the difficulty with amendment No. 918. Indeed, the term "enforcement notice" has exactly the same difficulty attached to it as his argument against our provision.<br><br>
On amendment No. 919, I repeat our undertaking to revisit clause 108(5), as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned. We shall also revisit other relevant clauses. We shall ensure that urgent intervention under parts IV and XII may take immediate or early effect. Apart from that, no decision should take effect until the matter has been fully disposed of by the tribunal or higher appeal courts. The latter element clearly includes the need to rule out the issuing of payment notices or any other action to enforce a decision that has not taken effect. On Report we shall introduce a complete set of consistent amendments to this effect.<br><br>
Amendment No. 920 relates to appeals from the tribunal to the Court of Appeal or Court of Session. The amendment is unnecessary and in any case I do not think that it would work. I understand that an appeal to the Court of Appeal does not have to be withdrawn; instead a form requesting the court to dismiss the appeal by consent must be signed. That continues under the civil court procedure rules. With that explanation and the undertakings that I have given, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 339(1), which relates to a decision notice, certainly gives the impression that the decision has been made to prosecute. However, as I understood the Minister's answer to my question, if the decision is not to prosecute, but instead to say, "Thank you for your explanation. You're good boys: you can carry on as before" it would still be described as a decision notice. I presume that people will be told, "I see that you have had a decision notice in your case." At least that is what one hopes. If it were called an enforcement notice, the question would be whether an enforcement notice had been issued. If that happened, it would be known immediately, as with a planning case, that a decision to enforce an alleged wrongdoing had been made. However, if there is merely a decision, it would not be known whether it was a decision to enforce an alleged wrongdoing, or a decision to take no further action. That seems rather misleading.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has not taken up those points, perhaps she will answer this question. The hon. Lady says that she cannot understand the difficulty. The term "decision notice" in our view implies a finding of guilt or innocence. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, the notice would simply indicate whether the FSA had decided to take action against the recipient. After all the wrangles that we have had since the Bill was issued in appalling draft form in July 1998, I had hoped that at least we had reached the stage where the FSA acts only as prosecutor, with only the tribunal acting judicially. None the less, the term "decision notice" may cause problems for the recipient, especially if non-United Kingdom regulators need to be informed about it. It is this point especially to which I want the Minister to respond. The term "enforcement notice" is much better as it makes clear that it is only a matter of the FSA deciding whether to enforce, and does not in itself imply guilt. My right hon. and learned Friend asked what one would call decision notices that do not affect a decision: perhaps "indecision notice" might be suitable; it would be more in keeping with the lack of decision on many other clauses during months of debate—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I see that Labour Members are waking up at last, which is very good news this Thursday morning. Will the Minister say how the provision might affect companies with non-UK regulators, who may see it in a different light as it could appear to them to imply guilt?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can answer the points made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire.<br><br>
The decision notice is given only when the FSA proposes to proceed, not if it decides to do nothing. "Decision notice" indicates a decision to proceed to the next stage. At present the Bill does not require a decision notice if a decision is made not to proceed. We shall address this gap in our amendments on Report. But whether a notice is called a decision notice or an enforcement notice is irrelevant to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the meaning of clause 339(1)(c), which begins—
<br><blockquote><p>"give the Authority's reasons for the decision … not to take, the action".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that that was clear. The phrase "not to take the action" is as transparently clear as the phrase "to take the action". The decision will be whether to proceed to the next stage, so there is no requirement for a decision notice not to proceed. No reference is made to taking, or not taking, the action to which the amendment relates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what the clause states. Subsection (1)(c) states that a decision notice must—
<br><blockquote><p>"give the Authority's reasons for the decision to take, or not to take, the action".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been some change to prior amendments. Amendment No. 963, for example, modifies the original amendment No. 921. It is not clear what is meant by the authority's
<br><blockquote><p>"exercising its functions under sections 338 and 339."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 963 would clarify the procedures to be followed when the FSA issues a warning notice or decision notice.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1224</span>
Amendment No. 922 would require the FSA to consult on the proposed procedure in relation to enforcement. Although it may have done so through consultation paper 17, consultation should be a statutory requirement, as is the procedure to consult on rules and guidelines. Our new subsection (2A) mirrors the words in clause 127(3), which applies to proposed guidance and the consultation procedures applicable to the proposed rules.<br><br>
Amendment No. 964 would make it clear that the procedure applies when the FSA proposes to give a warning or decision notice.<br><br>
Amendment No. 924 is self-explanatory. It would omit "changes" and insert "proposes to change".<br><br>
Amendment No. 925 would require consultation
<br><blockquote><p>"on the changes in the same manner as referred to in subsection (2A)".</p></blockquote>
These are technical amendments and I shall refer briefly to a wider issue in the stand part debate on clause 340.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have every sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's amendments. We accept amendments Nos. 963 and 964, which improve the drafting, and I am grateful to him.<br><br>
We are happy to accept the principle of amendments Nos. 922, 924 and 925. We agree that there should be an obligation on the FSA to consult. It has consulted on its enforcement procedures and we envisage that it will consult on any future changes. We have already undertaken to align the consultation requirements elsewhere in the Bill and there should be alignment with the consultation requirements applying to policy statements on financial penalties under parts VII and XIII. We propose to introduce the necessary changes to the clause at the same time, so I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would not press those amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her comments. We have had a great success early in the day.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1225</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After the triumph with our amendments and with the Government's intention to accept some of our ideas, I hope that we shall achieve equal success with the group of amendments before us. Subsection (7) as drafted seems to allow the authority not to follow its stated procedures. An earlier subsection of the clause makes the authority split the investigative function from the issuing of a notice. That important separation of powers, which was extensively debated in the Joint Committee, is wrong in terms of natural justice. The people who investigate an alleged breach of rules should not also be responsible for the issuing of a warning notice. Rightly, therefore, the Treasury agreed to require the authority to split those functions in its internal arrangements. Some observers thought that they should be formally split to an even greater degree between different organisations. Nevertheless, it was resolved that the separation of powers should be given statutory effect, which is well and good, and meets with our approval.<br><br>
However, that is undermined by subsection (7), which states that if the authority does not follow its procedures—including, of course, the procedure that I have just described—the validity of a warning notice or decision notice will not be affected. If the authority issued a warning notice or decision notice and the person on the receiving end successfully showed that the authority had not followed its procedure in splitting up the giving of a warning notice from the investigative procedures, nothing could then be done. The authority would incur no penalty for having breached its own rules in that way, and the warning notice would be just as valid as if it had followed its procedures. That is clearly wrong. The correct intention embodied in the earlier part of the clause is undermined by subsection (7). That is not good enough, and I should like the Minister to comment on it.<br><br>
The other two amendments seek to achieve the same end by way of a softer procedure. They would give the authority a let out if it did not strictly follow its procedures, but merely diverged from them, and provide that the warning notice or decision notice would not be affected by such a minor divergence as long as the recipient of the notice was not materially prejudiced by it.<br><br>
If the Minister is not willing to accept amendment No. 157, she will have no excuse for not accepting the other two amendments. However, I advance amendment No. 157 as our preferred option, and we shall decide to what degree we intend to press the amendments in the light of her response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should say from the outset that I understand exactly the thinking behind the Opposition amendments, and I am sympathetic with the spirit that lies behind them. I hope that I can persuade Conservative Members that our amendments are aimed at broadly the same objective.<br><br>
That objective is not to excuse the FSA from the need to take care in following its published procedures. It is important that those procedures are transparent and fair and that people can rely on their being followed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1226</span>
However, we concluded that a provision along the lines of subsection (7) was needed to ensure that the tribunal procedures, which are designed to test out the merits of the decision, cannot be hijacked by lengthy arguments about the minutiae of the procedures adopted by the FSA. For example, the FSA might choose to include in its procedure statement some detailed proposals relating to the time scale within which representations are considered, or the precise way in which a notice should be formulated.<br><br>
Without subsection (7), there is a risk that any minor error or departure from the standard procedure would result in the whole procedure being null, so that in effect no FSA decision had been made. That might give rise to arguments that the tribunal had no power to do anything, and that the FSA had to start the process again from scratch.<br><br>
Such arguments might be raised not at the appropriate time but months or years later, for example when the FSA sought to take further action against a firm that had ignored an earlier FSA decision and contended that the earlier decision had been taken in breach of proper procedures and was therefore null and void.<br><br>
We would not want a minor clerical error in the drafting of a notice to be the grounds for re-opening a decision, especially at some future date. Resources would be wasted if the FSA were required to start the procedure again. There would also be a danger that vulnerable consumers could be left at risk in the interim. Instead, as we sought to make clear during our discussion of part XIII of the Bill, the tribunal should follow its own proceedings, with unfettered discretion to consider the merits of the decision.<br><br>
9.45 am<br><br>
The tribunal's function is to consider the whole matter. It is right that its consideration should overtake the FSA's consideration, including any earlier procedural errors made by the FSA. That will respect the proper distinction between the administrative stage of the decision-making process, which is for the FSA to manage in a fair but flexible way, and the determinative judicial stage of the process which is for the independent tribunal. That does not mean that the procedures to be set out in the FSA's policy statement can lightly be ignored. On the contrary, the tribunal will be able to take into account the extent to which any procedural errors may have materially disadvantaged the other party, as amendment No. 961 makes clear.<br><br>
As a result of the amendments that we have made to schedule 11 at paragraph (13)(2), the tribunal will have the power to award costs against the FSA if it considers that the FSA has acted unreasonably in arriving at a decision. That is the right approach. Simply omitting subsection (7) would leave too much uncertainty. However, we want to make it clear that the tribunal has a role in ensuring that any procedural failures or irregularities do not prejudice the other party. In that sense, the intention of our amendments is quite close to that of amendment No. 927. The tribunal's fair procedures should rectify the failure by giving a person a fresh chance to have a fair hearing.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0306">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1227</span>
The tribunal will also be able to take into account the procedural failure if it considers that that is still necessary. Our amendments would allow the tribunal, in doing so, to balance the need to ensure that the FSA follows the proper procedures necessary to protect consumers and markets. On that basis, I hope that Opposition Members will agree to accept our amendments and withdraw their own.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on being the bearer of messages of sweetness and light. It may be the season of the year. I did not table the amendments, but it is comforting that our amendment No. 157—that number suggests that it was tabled some time ago—has encouraged the Government to table these amendments.<br><br>
Having listened to the Minister and read the Government amendments, I acknowledge that those amendments remove the sting in subsection (7) that had worried us. It is gratifying to note that if errors occur in relation to subsection (7), they will not be visited on the proposed defendant—that term relates to criminal law: in this context, it would be the authorised person against whom a decision notice was being given and enforcement procedures being taken. The results of those errors will not be visited on the authorised person if the failure to follow the proper procedures has materially disadvantaged that person. We sought to achieve that in proposing to remove subsection (7). While we wish to reflect further on the matter between now and Report, we welcome the Government amendments as a step forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend is an old softy this morning [HON. MEMBERS: "Abstain."] I shall not; I was about to end the bonhomie and cross-party collusion, but on reflection I shall defer to my right hon. and learned Friend's legal knowledge. The Government amendments are constructive, and we should leave it there.<br><br>
The Minister's reference to minutiae is somewhat asymmetrical. If we are to pursue people for what they consider to be small breaches of the rules, procedural rules would be applied to them although the authority will apparently be exempt from them. I do not approve of that arrangement, and I had hoped that if the Minister did not agree to amendment No. 157, she would at least agree to amendments Nos. 926 and 927. However, I am rather seduced by my right hon. and learned Friend's review of the situation, and we shall not press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'() But subsection (7) does not prevent the Tribunal from taking into account any such failure in considering a matter referred to it.'.—[<i>Miss Melanie Johnson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1228</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we move on, I want to discuss subsection (2) of the clause, which makes it clear that the person who gives a warning notice should be
<br><blockquote><p>"not directly involved in establishing the evidence on which that decision is based."</p></blockquote>
In view of the Government's amendments to clause 338, should we ensure that the person who decides whether information that the FSA possesses could undermine a case and should be disclosed to the defence is not involved in establishing that evidence? That is a subtle point, but the Government might consider adding that requirement to the clause so that full propriety may be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this brief clause stand part debate, the Government should explain how the requirements that are contained in clause 340(2) will operate. That subsection states that the person who is involved in establishing the evidence on which a decision is taken—in other words, the investigator who is employed by the FSA—will not be the person who decides whether to issue a warning notice or takes a decision that. results in a decision notice. How will the FSA operate in those circumstances? Is there a procedure, under current legislation, that separates the two functions? The two classic positions in the past 10 or 15 years are well reflected in the activities of the Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office, which work in different ways. With regard to the police and the CPS, there is a separate and independent body that makes the decisions. Plainly, the FSA and the Government have chosen not to take that route. A separate body would involve excessive bureaucracy and formalisation, which I would not encourage. However, it is important that the decision takers should be substantially apart from the investigators. It is part of human nature that once an investigator gets his or her teeth into a subject, it is difficult to be objective about the evidential and public interest requirements that are necessary for prosecution or, in this case, for disciplinary or enforcement action.<br><br>
The Serious Fraud Office contends with that problem on a much smaller scale and, I suspect, with more high-quality personnel who work on individual cases. A prosecution decision within the SFO is taken at assistant director level, which is only one level below the director herself. High-level supervision is required. I am not suggesting that high-calibre people will be not be carrying out the work in the FSA; indeed, we expect such people to be involved. None the less, it will be necessary to have someone who is significantly more senior—one rung is not enough—who can stand back and look at the bigger picture before starting what is a prosecution process. Will the Minister sketch out what arrangements are in place and what are contemplated?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me say first in response to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the function is not separate under existing legislation, so the Bill will be an improvement. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) had related concerns. In criminal cases, the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 places the responsibility for disclosure on the prosecutor. It does not specify detailed internal arrangements. It would not be right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0307">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1229</span>
to go further, although clause 340 requires the FSA to consult on the detail of its internal arrangement. Last year's consultation paper 17, "Financial services regulation: Enforcing the new regime", sets out the details for the proposed enforcement committee arrangements. It states that there will be an enforcement committee chaired by a person appointed for the purpose by the board who will be assisted by people with appropriate legal and other expertise. I hope that that meets the Opposition's concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is an improvement that the Bill requires that to happen, but the Minister has not said whether that is the case now. I hope that it is and that procedures are in place to ensure that a significantly higher level of decision making is in place, so that such decisions are made at a higher level rather than by the person doing the day-to-day investigation of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The functions are not currently separated. The enforcement committee arrangements provide much of what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has been arguing for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We realise that the process which emerged from the Joint Committee is a considerable improvement, in that it addresses the territory of judge, prosecutor and jury not being one. On the detailed issue of disclosing evidence to the defence, is it the Government's intention that their amendments to clause 338 will be interpreted along the lines I described? It strikes me that it would be inappropriate for the person who discovers the evidence to make the decision about what should or should not be disclosed.</span></p>
<p>10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are considering the precise detail of the further provisions about rights of access to evidence. I undertake to look at that point again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her response.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>', or is reckless as to whether it may induce,'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Part XXV deals with miscellaneous offences, so we must be vigilant to ensure that no new offences are created that are at variance with the basic principles of our law or of natural justice.<br><br>
I alighted on the word "recklessly" in subsection(1)(c). We all understand the need to deal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1230</span>
with fraud and dishonesty, but reckless behaviour goes beyond that. I am advised that Scottish law does not acknowledge recklessness as part of the mens rea or wicked intention sufficient to establish fraud. If the intention is to punish fraud and dishonesty, it should not proceed beyond what is established under Scottish law. If reckless behaviour is to be punished, why is the authority immune from legal action if it recklessly issues information or statements that may be intended to stop people entering into agreements? For example, the authority may put out a statement about a firm to warn customers or the market generally about trading with that firm. If the authority does so recklessly, will it be immune from legal action by those who suffer loss? If it is immune, it is wrong to place others on the receiving end of the criminal law if they make reckless statements of the same nature. There are two points: first, the Scottish point and, secondly, the authority's relationship to the clause and whether it is intended to go beyond fraudulent and dishonest behaviour and punish that which is reckless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is an important part of the armoury designed to deal with wrongdoers and help to maintain investors' confidence that the financial markets are clean and fair places to do business. It carries forward the existing offences of misleading statements and practices contained in sections 47 and 133 of the Financial Services Act 1986 and section 35 of the Banking Act 1987 by providing for two criminal offences in the area of misleading practices and statements.<br><br>
Subsections (1) and (2) set out the first offence. Broadly speaking, they make it am offence for any person knowingly or recklessly to make false or misleading statements, if they are made to induce someone to enter into an investment agreement, or if the person is reckless about whether it will induce someone to enter into an agreement. Subsections (3) and (4) make it an offence for a person to act in a way that creates a false or misleading impression about the market in an investment, if that is done to create that impression and thereby to induce someone to enter into an investment agreement.<br><br>
A person who puts out false information about a company in which he holds shares in order to boost the share price would be caught by the first offence. When the share price rises the fraudster sells out, a practice described in American parlance as "pump and dump" schemes. An example of the second offence is the classic boiler house operation where fraudsters buy and sell shares to each other, thus misleading investors into believing that there is keen market interest in the shares. Investors are thereby induced to buy shares that later turn out to have little or no marketability or value.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 320 and 321 are intended to cut back the scope of the first offence so that it does not include persons who recklessly make misleading statements with the purpose of inducing people to enter into an investment agreement. I cannot accept that. In many cases, such recklessness may occur in the context of an outright fraud. A fraudster may not know, and certainly will not care, whether the statements he is making to his victim are true or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0308">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1231</span>
false: he is interested solely in concluding his fraudulent transaction. It is hard to see why such a person should be treated any differently from the fraudster who is sure that the statement he is making is misleading.<br><br>
It is true that reckless statements may be made out of sheer incompetence, but that does not make their effects any less damaging. We are not talking here about an offhand or chance comment: the offence can arise only if the person concerned is criminally reckless. For example, putting out a prospectus that is accidentally wrong is very different from putting out a prospectus that has not been checked at all.<br><br>
I also cannot accept amendment No. 322, for it would mean that people who knowingly made false statements or dishonestly concealed information would not be guilty of an offence, if they were reckless about whether they induced people to enter agreements. That cannot be right. Consider, for example, the person who maliciously publishes false information about a competitor with the intent of damaging his business. He may not care whether third parties rely on his statement to enter into investment agreements, but that may well be the effect. Such conduct could lead to so people losing significant amounts of money, so it is hard to see why it should be outside the scope of this offence.<br><br>
I turn now to a specific point made by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) about the FSA's immunity against charges of recklessness. The comparison is not appropriate, as the Bill does not make the FSA immune from criminal prosecution. As for the FSA's immunity from damages, we have rehearsed those arguments many times in respect of various parts of the Bill, and I do not propose to go over them again. On the point about Scottish law, the provision is already in existing statutes—in sections 47 and 133 of the Financial Services Act 1986 and in section 35 of the Banking Act 1987—and is already part of Scottish law. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Lady, who said that reckless behaviour could be no less damaging in its effect. We seem to be judging an action by its effect rather than by its intention. That was why I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that Scots law does not acknowledge recklessness as part of the men's rea—or wicked intention—sufficiently to establish fraud. The Scots have regard, as I said, to intention, not effect, so I am not convinced that the Minister's comments are relevant. It may be, and often is, the case that recklessness is part of fraud, but the person should be prosecuted for the fraud and it is important not to rely entirely on the recklessness component. Again, the Minister's comments did not address my point.<br><br>
The Minister said that the FSA would be subject to the criminal law—I am glad, at least, for that. Earlier in the Bill we debated the vulnerability or immunity of the authority and a distinction was made between reckless actions and actions that are not reckless That distinction already exists in the Bill and it would be valid to carry it forward to these provisions.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1232</span>
I should be grateful if the Minister would say more about the Scottish case. It is not good enough to consider only the effect of an action because the criminal law in Scotland explicitly rules that out with respect to alleged fraudulent behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two responses for the right hon. Gentleman. First, fraud is a different matter from a statutory offence and if an element of recklessness is part of the offence, it can be dealt with in relation to a statutory offence that is already part of Scottish law. Secondly, financial services law already applies in Scotland and will continue to do so. I undertake to ensure that nothing has been missed in the right hon. Gentleman's comments, but I believe that I have addressed the issues that he raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Lady's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a couple of brief comments. First, I have raised the concerns of the newspaper industry before. It claims that it is unclear whether "making a statement" could embrace mere publications of statements—in advertising or editorials, for example. If so, an offence could be committed by the publication of an advertisement or in a promotion or editorial deemed to be misleading. The industry argues that there should be a more specific offence in order to protect a publisher acting legitimately in the course of business.<br><br>
10.15 am<br><br>
Clause 341(5) refers to false or misleading statements and states that a forecast must be made in the UK or directed to someone in the UK and that an agreement must be made in the UK. The industry would prefer the Minister to ensure that the territorial scope of the provision is more narrowly drawn.<br><br>
My second point can be dealt with appropriately in this part of the Bill. Just two days ago, the Minister announced that the stock exchange was to lose its monopoly over the regulatory news services, which publicise company announcements. That probably comes as no great surprise given that the stock exchange is no longer the competent authority for listing, as we discussed some weeks ago.<br><br>
Will the Minister comment on the issue of misleading information and misleading statements that are put out by companies that are not up to the mark or by people who try to manipulate markets for their own ends? How does she expect the system to work given that competing news services, such as Reuters or Bloomberg, will come into the market? She also said that a news service might be available on the internet.<br><br>
There is the key issue of timing. Price-sensitive information could have an effect on share prices literally the second that it is made public. The accuracy of statements is essential because they can lead to immediate shifts in share prices. Will the Minister give details of how information will be regulated?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0309">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1233</span>
Presumably, that will be done by the FSA. Information will be disseminated at different speeds, depending on the agency involved. Will the FSA make information from companies available to all the agencies simultaneously? If so, how will that happen?<br><br>
We welcome competition in this area and hope that it will speed up the dissemination of information. At the same time, however, it needs to be equally available to everybody who operates in the market—there needs to be a level playing field. The quality of information is paramount. The scope for misleading information to creep into company announcements should be no greater than it was when the stock exchange had a monopoly on the news service. Perhaps the Minister can allay our fears on those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only agree with the hon. Gentleman's point about the importance of the accuracy of the information. We could not possibly disagree about that. A statement is made if it is published. It is then in the public domain and the damage is done.<br><br>
On newspapers, the legislation has been in place since 1986. Someone would be guilty in the example that the hon. Gentleman gave only if he was criminally reckless. That is different from accidental behaviour, and that difference answers some of the concerns that he raised.<br><br>
On news services, we are working with the FSA to examine in more detail how information that is required under the directive should be disseminated to the markets.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
OFFENCES BY BODIES CORPORATE ETC</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 928, in page 174, line 26, leave out 'attributable to' and insert 'caused by'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 931, in page 174, line 42, leave out 'attributable to' and insert 'caused by'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause deals with offences by bodies corporate and partnerships. Subsection (1) allows the officers of an offending body corporate to be penalised for something that the body corporate does. However, the expression "attributable to" is too wide in this case. It might, for example, include negligence—merely giving somebody an opportunity to commit an offence. The officer would clearly not have agreed to or connived in the offence, otherwise he would be caught by subsection (1)(a). Therefore, if he is to be held guilty because of mere negligence, his negligence ought to have caused the offence. Amendment No. 931 deals with the equivalent provision in clause 343(1).</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1234</span>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause will ensure that those in senior positions—those who can influence the actions of a business—take full responsibility for the actions of that business. Let us consider a hypothetical case of a firm that is engaged in a regulated activity without authorisation or exemption as a result of the activities of certain junior employees. The FSA will be able to prosecute the firm under clause 21 and seek a fine or possibly the winding-up of the firm if that is seen to be just and equitable in the eyes of the court.<br><br>
Without the clause, the FSA would be able to take only limited action against the officer of the firm concerned. That person would not have been engaged in a regulated activity, but he might have consented to the actions of his employees or their misconduct may be attributable to his neglect in failing to supervise them properly. The FSA could, in those circumstances, ban him or her from employment in a regulated activity. However, given that in the example that I am citing, the main business of the firm is not a regulated activity, such action may not make much of a difference. The clause will fill a gap by providing that such persons are also guilty of an offence. Clearly, in that context there needs to be a causal element in the sense that the offence must be attributable to neglect on the part of the officer.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 928 and 931 would restrict the offence involving neglect to cases in which the neglect actually caused the body corporate to commit an offence. For example, an officer whose neglect of duty had allowed the offence to occur may, nevertheless, try to argue that the offence was not strictly caused by his neglect, but by the acts of his employees. That is not the case under existing legislation or under section 733 of the Companies Act 1985, which uses the same "attributable to" formulation in respect of offences under that Act.<br><br>
It would be unfortunate and confusing if a different formulation were adopted from that which currently applies to existing financial services and Companies Act offences. On the basis of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation. On the basis that the provision is consistent with other formulations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 929, in page 174, line 33, leave out 'in' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'constituted under the laws of'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 930, in page 174, line 38, leave out 'in' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'constituted under the laws or'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are important; they would correct what we believe is a mistake. The Bill will hold a partner in a partnership guilty in the same way as a director of a company is held guilty. I have no problem with that, but the two provisions seem to apply to where the partnership is rather than to the law under which it is constituted,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0310">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1235</span>
hence the reason behind the two amendments. The difference between an English partnership and a Scottish partnership, for example, is that an English partnership is not a body corporate and, therefore, anything done by any one of the partners is, under law, done by each of them.<br><br>
Conversely, a Scottish partnership is a body corporate and the wording used under subsection (1) in relation to officers of a company is used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendments. I accept that there may be some confusion about whether what is being referred to under subsections (3) and (4) is the nationality of the partnership—whether it is constituted under English, Scottish or Northern Irish law—or to the territory in which the offence may have been committed, The hon. Gentleman's amendment would mean that the Bill would not cover the eventuality of a partnership constituted under the laws of a foreign state committing an offence in the United Kingdom, which it clearly should do. Given that there is a problem, we intend to re-examine the clause's drafting and will table amendments at a later stage. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are happy with that undertaking and will be pleased if the Minister will address the problem on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

EFTA FIRMS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want clarification about European Free Trade Association firms, although I suspect that the answers will be similar in principle to those relating to European Union or European economic area firms. To what extent can the authority discipline EFTA firms—although it applies to others as well—that are instituted and have passported rights into our markets? I was troubled earlier in the Bill—I apologise, because I had to leave the Room, did not hear the answer and am taking the opportunity to raise the subject again—that we felt unduly inhibited in enforcing on those firms passported into the country what will certainly apply to ordinary UK firms. Will the Minister satisfy us that the FSA will be as effective at disciplining passported firms as at disciplining those authorised directly under our procedures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a subsidiary of a firm from a country subject to a third country decision is already authorised in a European Union member state, then its entitlement to exercise passport rights to establish a branch or provide services in another member state is not affected by the third country decision. That is not the case for subsidiaries of third country firms authorised in EEA states which are not also EU member states—Norway, Iceland and Leichtenstein—referred to in the Bill as EFTA firms. It is a little more complicated than the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire thought. The clause gives the Treasury the power to make a determination that particular EFTA firms do not qualify for automatic authorisation under schedule 3 following a third country decision relating to the country of their parent.<br><br>
10.30 am<br><br>
The procedures will require the Treasury to give written notice to a firm of any determination or the withdrawal of the determination made in respect of that firm. The Treasury must also publish notice of any determination or withdrawal in a manner that the Treasury thinks is most likely to come to the attention of those affected by it. That publication must be made on or as soon as is practical after the date of the determination or the withdrawal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see that there is a special provision for Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and as Liechtenstein has a certain reputation, it is desirable that there should be an effective system. However, I understand from the Minister that there is more power in relation to EFTA than to other passported firms. Perhaps we can return to the matter later.</span></p>

GAINING CONTRACTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my ignorance as a relatively new Member, I lighted upon the clause and was surprised by it. I should therefore appreciate some further details from the Minister.<br><br>
I did some research and came across the Gaming Act 1845, in particular section 18, from which I shall quote. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"And be it enacted, That all Contracts or Agreements, whether by Parole or in Writing, by way of gaming or wagering, shall be null and void; and that no Suit shall be brought or maintained in any Court of Law or Equity for recovering any Sum of Money or valuable Thing alleged to be won upon any Wager, or which shall have been deposited in the Hands of any Person to abide the Event of which any Wager shall have been made: provided always, that this Enactment shall not be deemed to apply to any Subscription or Contribution, or Agreement to subscribe or contribute, for or toward any Plate, Prize or Sum of Money to be awarded to the Winner or Winners of any lawful Game, Sport, Pastime, or Exercise."</p></blockquote>
Legislation was beautifully written in those days.<br><br>
I looked, too, at section 1 of the Gaming Act 1892; I shall not read it out, but hon. Members may like to know that the entire Act takes up one page. It is a masterpiece of brevity compared to this 367-clause Bill, which it seems that we have been debating for many years. There are examples to be learned from procedures cast more than a century ago. My question to the Minister is what is that proposal doing in the Bill—it does not appear in the Financial Services Act 1986? The explanatory notes briefly mention
<br><blockquote><p>"derivative contracts such as 'put options"'</p></blockquote>
in the same context as gaming contracts. People involved in the financial services industry might take exception to the idea that any legitimate financial business, along the lines of any of the things that we have been discussing in Committee, constitutes lawful
<br><blockquote><p>"Gaming, Sport, Pastime or Exercise."</p></blockquote>
Although it might seem that way to unsuspecting members of the public in the outside world, dealing in the stock market or other similar activity is a more legitimate enterprise than reference to the Gaming Acts 1845 and 1892 would appear to suggest. I should be grateful if the Minister would enlighten us on why that is at all relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's interest in this matter. Why certain types of contract are gaming contracts and whether they are enforceable has been the subject of much discussion in the City in the past 30 years. The first such contracts that I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1238</span>
encountered related to shipping insurance and were known as tonner contracts. I believe that there are other insurance contracts known as Chinese retros, but whether a Chinese retro is a tonner contract is a question that I shall not expect the Minister to answer.<br><br>
I assume that the clause is included in the Bill so that the statutory position relating to the unenforceability of gaming contracts does not confuse the Financial Services Authority's ability to regulate what it regards as proper trading in the City. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was right, and that the Government were right to include in the explanatory notes reference to derivatives because, in so far as I understand derivatives, I believe that, on the whole, unless people are merely speculating, they enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge their position, or at least to bring some stability to their trading position.<br><br>
However, it would be helpful to have a more detailed explanation from the Minister on the thinking underlying the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As right hon. and hon. Members will have realised from reading the Bill, the clause relates to gaming contracts, which are provided for under legislation dating back to 1845. Such contracts are generally not enforceable in law, as the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire emphasised, but some regulated activities involve entering into or performing contracts that are very similar to gaming contracts—for example, the derivatives contracts that must be settled in cash—and there is a risk that such contracts could fall within the scope of the gaming laws and therefore be unenforceable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to answer the points that have been raised.<br><br>
It is important that that does not happen. Financial markets require certainty that contracts will be enforceable. Therefore, the clause makes explicit provision for such contracts to be enforceable in law, regardless of the provisions of gaming legislation—however exciting that is—or the common law in Scotland. The clause is based on the existing provision contained in clause 63 of the Financial Services Act 1986, but I am afraid that, as drafted, the protection provided by this clause may not be as wide as that provided under that Act. It may be too narrow because subsection (2)(b) expressly applies only to regulated activities and would therefore not apply to a contract entered into in the course of any activity that benefits from an exclusion from the scope of regulated activities under the Bill.<br><br>
Under the Financial Services Act 1986, contracts entered into in the course of an activity that benefits from an exclusion in part III or part IV of schedule 1 of that Act also benefit from the provisions of section 63. That means, for example, that a user of the derivatives market, who does not require authorisation because he benefits from the provisions in schedule 1 of the Financial Services Act, relating to dealing on own account, can enter into contracts, knowing that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0312">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1239</span>
he will be able to enforce them. We are currently considering how best to deal with that issue, and we will make proposals in due course. Our policy intention is clear: we want to reproduce in the Bill the same protection for the enforceability of the contracts in question that is provided by existing legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. It is slightly alarming that if my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire and I had not made our points, the clause would have been agreed to without comment. The Minister now admits, however, that it has problems and that the Government will have to make changes. That is a strange way of proceeding. The Minister might at least have given notice that amendments have to be made and given some explanation. In her haste to speed through the remaining clauses of the Bill, she would have left the Committee unaware that the defects exist. At least it is now on record that the clause must be amended, together with scores of other clauses.<br><br>
I am grateful for the Minister's explanation, and I partly understood her points. Why could derivative contracts—which are being singled out—constitute gaming, and on what terms? Is it because many such contracts have to be settled in cash, which was a qualification given by the Minister? Derivative products can be safe. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire said, many derivative products are used to hedge positions and to protect them against losses. Such protection may apply to many new products, which may or may not be the subject of CAT—charges, easy access and fair terms—standard marks, which the Government are happy to produce. It operates on the basis that new and less well-off investors who are exposing themselves to equity risk can in many cases use derivatives as part of a product to limit the downside to zero. In effect, a derivative product may amount to a financial insurance policy. It could be argued that derivatives are at the other end of the spectrum from that which is occupied by gaming, gambling and other speculative activities. I appreciate the Minister's points, but they cast aspersions on a fast increasing and necessary part of the market that involves protection from risk of the most vulnerable and least experienced investors. I wanted to make that point when I attempted to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Tyrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am flabbergasted that the Government have decided that the clause is defective. When I read it, I thought that it looked perfectly all right, and I cannot understand why there is so much confusion about it. I thought that the distinction between a contract to which the Gaming Acts apply and a derivative was well understood and effectively policed by the tax system. If one makes a gain from a derivative, the Revenue will say that it may be subject to capital gains tax, just as they would deal with a loss. If one makes out a contract that is described as a bet, one is subject to betting duties. Entire industries work out how to draft contracts to ensure that the contract holders end up paying betting duty rather than capital gains tax. Spread betters operate in the markets all the time. I cannot
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1240</span>
understand why any more distinctions are necessary in addition to those which are already deeply embedded in the tax system. I am therefore at a loss to comprehend the problem to which the Minister referred, and to understand why she has said that yet another clause will have to be rewritten and reconsidered on Report. Why does she feel the need to make that change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The thought that occurred to me was what unregulated activities are excluded given that the Bill is designed to cover all relevant financial activities. Could the exclusions be part of the mortgage lending business? One reason why building societies are able to offer fixed-rate loans is that they are major users of derivatives. Will the mortgage industry fall under regulation? I realise that that is probably not the relevant territory, because lending in general is covered. However, what unregulated activities do the Government want to protect from the possibility of contracts being deemed void under the Gaming Acts by tabling amendments at a later stage?</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is complex. Clause 351(2)(a) refers to contracts
<br><blockquote><p>"entered into by either or each party by way of business".</p></blockquote>
However, the word "business" is not defined. What does business mean in this context? Subsection (2)(b) applies to any contract
<br><blockquote><p>"the making or performance of which by either party constitutes a regulated activity falling within paragraph 2 of Schedule 2."</p></blockquote>
Here, again, we reach undefined territory. Paragraph 1 to schedule 2 deals with investments. What does an investment mean? Paragraph 2 to schedule 2 raises the matter of an investment that is a contract of insurance which includes the carrying out of the contract. That also calls out for definition. Will the Minister quickly explain what is meant by business investments and investments that are contracts of insurance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that we intend to do more work on the clause. Its purpose is to ensure that appropriate contracts are enforceable. I cannot disagree on the potential value of derivative instruments. That is why we are ensuring that they are enforceable. I see that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire is tempting me into defining the word "business", but if I did that, we would be here to the far side of Christmas and perhaps even into the new millennium. I shall resist that temptation, although I am on duty over the millennium and I am happy to he here if hon. Members wish it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister have a go at answering my question? What is in the clause that cannot be dealt with by the tax law? The long-standing definitions of and distinctions between derivatives and gaming are well understood in the market I cannot understand why the Minister has opened herself up to saying that this is a lousy clause which will be rewritten. The issue was clear and I do not understand what the Minister does not like about her own clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my colleagues for coming in on the back of my innocent straying into the matter, which seems to have opened a can of worms.

The more the Minister adjusted her position on the clause, the more alarm bells rang. It strikes me that we may find that many of the clauses that we have been steaming through in a spirit of co-operation are defective as well, but the Minister was not inclined to tip us off at this stage. On the basis that this has turned out to be a complete and utter shambles, I urge my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have so much respect for my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) that I am reluctant to issue any word of caution about his question. I know that he is a Treasury animal, but I now know that his overwhelming interest is in taxation. I suspect that when the clause is being considered carefully, as the Minister has promised to do, what my hon. Friend said will be given great weight. I would, however, observe—and hope that it will be accepted—the issue goes wider than taxation. The real issue is the enforceability of contracts.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'or is a Saturday or Sunday'.</p></blockquote>
This is an extremely down-to-earth amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is common sense. It relates to subsection (3) on page 181, which provides that if something has to be done within a given period,
<br><blockquote><p>"no account is to be taken of any day which is a public holiday",</p></blockquote>
but there is no reference to Saturdays or Sundays. They might occasionally be public holidays, but they are normally just plain old Saturdays and Sundays. I should have thought that the words "public holiday" would include Saturdays and Sundays, although
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1242</span>
perhaps some subtle definition, otherwise hidden, automatically includes them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The specified periods have been determined on the basis that they will include weekends. Some legislation specifies that weekends should not be included, but that is generally when the periods in question are considerably shorter than those provided for in the Bill. The new civil procedure rules developed by Lord Woolf regulate procedure in civil courts. For example, rule 28.84 provides that, when something is required to be done within a certain period, weekends and bank holidays do not count, but only if that period is of five clear days or less. Weekends and bank holidays count if the period is longer. Given the periods that we are considering, the inclusion of weekends is clearly reasonable and in line with the practice of the courts. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the Minister has explained the situation, I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CARRYING ON ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 933, in page 181, leave out lines 15 to 18.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 965, in page 181, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) by engaging in the regulated activity the relevant UK firm is exercising an EEA right'.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments cover similar territory and are, to some extent, optional. The essential point is that the clause extends what is normally regarded as the conduct of business in the United Kingdom. Someone with an office registered in the United Kingdom, but who does business in Europe, will be deemed to be doing business in the United Kingdom and will, therefore, be bound elsewhere in Europe by two potentially conflicting sets of regulations. The lack of a definition of what constitutes the conduct of business in the United Kingdom is a technical deficiency. The definition might appear elsewhere, but I have not been able to find it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 933 would delete the second paragraph of clause 353 and is a probing amendment inviting something better. The clause provides an extended definition of when regulated activities that might not otherwise be treated as being conducted in the United Kingdom will be so treated. The first case seems too wide and we would like it to be discussed and narrowed. The Government are obviously trying to follow the concept under the single market directives that it is for the home member state to give authorisation for relevant activities, regardless of where those activities occur in the European Economic Area.<br><br>
Although such measures are required only for those activities listed in the single market directives, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0314">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1243</span>
clause applies to any regulated activity. Without justification, the authorisation requirement will be extended to branches established in other EEA states, regardless of whether those branches are under the day-to-day management of a United Kingdom branch, as set out in subsection (3), which applies to non-EEA branches. The Government surely did not intend merely to protect the reputation of the United Kingdom market; if they had, they would have provided such protection for branches in non-EEA states.<br><br>
The first case should be divided in two. Subsection (2) should apply only to situations in which the United Kingdom firm is exercising an EEA right by engaging in the relevant activity. In all other cases, the relevant deeming provisions should apply only when subsection (3)(c) applies. Is it intended that the FSA should regulate those deemed United Kingdom activities, whether under subsections (2) or (3)? The Committee will recollect that when we discussed the matter under clause 108, the Government said that they would deal with it under clause 353—so we are all ears. If the FSA is not intended to regulate those non-UK branches in the normal case, what will happen with regard to the foreign business carve-up that we have discussed in the past? Will the provision apply when the business is done with a counter party or client in the United Kingdom? It would apply at present, but if the proposed foreign business carve-up, which we trust will be retained, is to apply to activities not carried on from a UK office, it will mean that the activities from the deemed UK branch will not be included in the carve-up. That would mean a significant extension to regulation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 965 would give a reduced version of the provision. It would specify that the activity in question was carried on as an EEA right.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that amendment No. 965 was intended by the hon. Gentleman to supersede amendment No. 933, but obviously I am wrong about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in part an answer to amendment No. 933, but we should like to know what the Government might be proposing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification.<br><br>
I should like first to say a few words about our approach to the Bill's territorial scope generally. We have often touched on it during the Committee's sittings, often in highly technical contexts. I shall be brief, but I hope it will help to place my remarks on the amendment in context.<br><br>
We are, as Committee members will know, committed to the principle of home-state regulation in Europe. We see home-state regulation as an important way of overcoming barriers to trade and avoiding duplication of regulation. We are committed to supporting appropriate developments in that direction in the international arena. Perhaps it goes without saying that we are fully committed to implementing our treaty and directive obligations.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1244</span>
Against the background that I have set out, we are of course mindful that consumers could be vulnerable to incoming overseas financial services providers. The Opposition—who, I appreciate, also support the principle of home-state regulation—have previously expressed similar concerns about the predicament of United Kingdom consumers. We all appreciate the need for regulation in the home state to be effective.<br><br>
We have been trying to achieve balance in the Bill between a more fully home-state regulatory approach and protection for consumers under the current system. Our approach is demonstrated in clause 19, which concerns financial promotion by unauthorised persons. There we have proposed that promotions issued from overseas into the United Kingdom and directed at United Kingdom persons will be caught by the provision, unless they fall within a specific exemption. That is to protect the interests of United Kingdom consumers. However, at the same time we propose that promotions issued by United Kingdom persons overseas should also be caught, in line with the general principle of home-state regulation. That should help to equip the FSA to participate fully in exercises requiring international regulatory co-operation.<br><br>
I undertook, when we were debating part IX, to return, at the point we have now reached, to the subject of our approach to the territorial scope of the FSA's rules. The relevant principles come to the fore in this context and a balance must be struck. As ever, we are mindful of the need for not only a light touch but the safeguarding of consumers' interests<br><br>
Amendment No. 965 would amend subsection (2) of the clause, which, when read with clause 17, has the effect that a firm will require authorisation if its registered office—or, if it does not have a registered office, its head office—is in the UK and it carries on regulated activities in another EEA state.<br><br>
Subsection (2) was inserted into clause 353 in order properly to implement our European obligations under, for example, the investment services directive. The ISD provides that investment firms within the meaning of the directive must be authorised in their home member state. The directive defines the term "home member state" to mean, in the case of natural persons such as individuals, the place where the head office is located or, in the case of legal persons such as companies, the location of the registered office—or, if there is no registered office, the location of the head office. Indeed, if a UK firm is providing passported investment services into other member states, or has used the passport to establish a branch, it will need to be authorised here before it can do so.<br><br>
Passporting firms will also need to have the relevant permission to carry on the proposed investment services in the UK before they can carry on the same services in other member states. Our reason for inserting subsection (2) was to ensure that firms that fall within the ISD are properly authorised as the directive requires. However, having looked at the clause again, I think that there may be a case for further reconsidering its provisions, and I thank the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs for raising that point.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0315">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1245</span>
The investment services directive applies only to so-called "investment firms". Those are, in directive-speak, firms that carry on what are termed "core investment services"—although if an investment firm carries on both core and certain specified non-core investment services, it may be able to obtain a passport to carry on its non-core business in other member states as well.<br><br>
As drafted, subsection (2) could potentially apply the authorisation requirements to non-ISD firms—that is, firms that are incorporated or have their head office here, but do not carry on core investment services in the circumstances that are contemplated by the directive. It could also apply the authorisation requirements to firms that fall outside the requirements of, for example, the second banking co-ordination directive or the relevant insurance directives.<br><br>
Three kinds of firm could fall outside the scope of the directive, but be caught by subsection (2). Those are: UK-incorporated firms which, through European offices, engage solely in commodity derivatives business; give only investment advice; or engage solely in custody activities.<br><br>
As a general principle, and in the light of experience such as the BCCI case, the international regulatory community—not only the EU, but the Basel committee—has recognised the intrinsic difficulties involved if an entity is legally constituted in one place but has its head office, or is run, in another place. A set-up such as that can make it difficult properly to supervise the firm, especially if the firm's mind and management is not really within what should be the home state jurisdiction.<br><br>
However, I appreciate that subsection (2) potentially goes beyond the directives' requirements and, as I said, I should like to reconsider whether it might be appropriate to limit its effect. I should particularly like to reconsider the position of firms that are not currently within the scope of the directives—as amendment No. 965 suggests—and whether any further changes to the clause might be required in the light of any changes made as a result of that further consideration of the amendment.<br><br>
In considering the issues further, we will of course be mindful of the UK's competitive position. We do not wish to apply unnecessary layers of regulation or to incentivise firms to establish themselves offshore. Balanced against that, however, it is essential to ensure that the appropriate standards of protection and supervision are in place.<br><br>
If we conclude, after further reflection, that there is a case for restricting the application of subsection (2) in some way, we would still need to ensure that, in appropriate cases, UK-incorporated or headquartered firms were nevertheless subject to the authorisation requirements—for example, if the day-to-day management of the regulated activities was run from the UK.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1246</span>
I hope that my comments have reassured Conservative Members, and that they feel able to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
I should like to say a few words about the FSA's ability to make rules in relation to overseas activities that are carried on by authorised persons. That issue relates closely to the amendment that we have just discussed, and Opposition Members have raised the question of the territorial application of the FSA's rules in relation to parts II and IX of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said when we discussed part IX, the FSA's ability to make rules relating to authorised persons' overseas business is an important issue that arises in a variety of contexts throughout the Bill. I am grateful to him for agreeing that the issue should be discussed on reaching this juncture. That has helped us to avoid having the same, or similar, discussions several times.<br><br>
I fully appreciate that, in practice, applying overly burdensome regulation to UK firms' overseas business could have a potentially detrimental effect on their ability to compete in overseas markets, but that is not what we or the industry want. That would not be in the interests of the Government, the industry, the consumer or the FSA. In general, we do not regard duplicative, or extra-territorial, regulation as the way to maintain or build on the undoubted success of the financial services industry in this country. Of course, having said that, there are circumstances in which it may be necessary to apply regulation extra-territorially, and where the net result may be an element of regulatory duplication. In some cases, the European directives effectively require that. However, I expect the FSA to apply a suitably light touch to the business regulation of overseas branches of authorised firms, as do many self-regulating organisations under the Financial Services Act 1986.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that detailed response, which has put on record some important points. She seemed to say that, with regard to this clause and part IX clauses, further amendments may be made on Report. As I said, amendment No. 933 is essentially a probing amendment, so we are happy to withdraw it in anticipation that the matter will be sorted out.<br><br>
I have some ancillary comments to make. The Minister referred to clause 19. I was upset to note that, since we debated it, France, Italy and Germany have cited clause 19 in an EU directive. They propose country-of-destiny regulation for all retail or consumer matters, but that the question of country of origin should relate only to business-to-business transactions. Such a directive would be a complete disaster for consumers and the development of internet business. This is not the time to discuss the EU directive, but I remind the Minister that we are not happy about the unlimited way in which clause 19 claims extra-territorial e-commerce powers. Although we understand that the Treasury intends to deal with such matters through exemptions, the provision will incite the sort of response that we have seen from Europe.<br><br>
The biggest issue is bank regulation, where BCCI was a classic case study. In practice, one must pin the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0316">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1247</span>
regulatory duty on the appropriate central bank, but how will that be defined if the head office is in a territory—particularly an EU-wide territory—where nothing much happens, and the business is located somewhere else? The proposed solution is one approach, but it is not satisfactory.<br><br>
The Minister responded to our biggest worry that United Kingdom firms that are regulated here and operate in France, Germany, Italy and Spain might be subject to UK regulations, especially on the retail marketing side, that conflict with the regulations of the states in which they operate. It would be unreasonable to expect them to have to meet higher regulatory standards in Germany or France than organisations based in those countries.<br><br>
The Minister responded by saying that the FSA will either exclude the application of, for example, marketing rules or give a blanket exemption. The intention is to deal with the matter via FSA regulation and not in the Bill. I should appreciate confirmation that I have understood that correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that. The hon. Gentleman has set out, as have I, the many difficulties in this area. We are committed to home-state regulation, but we are in a difficult environment and a balance must be struck. We are striving to strike the right balance.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>

CONTROLLER</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 183, line 44, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(8) An agreement or arrangement is not within subsection (4)(g) if the agreement or arrangement is for either H or the other person to acquire, hold or dispose of shares or other interests as agent or nominee on behalf of the other without it or the other person being able to exercise or control the exercise of voting powers in his own discretion.'.</p></blockquote>
As the Committee will be aware from the number of the amendment, it was tabled in July. It covers a tricky area and its purpose is to tease from the Treasury some solutions, which do not seem to be forthcoming in Government amendments. I am sure that the Minister will have something to say on the subject.<br><br>
The amendment was tabled because subsection (4)(g) is too wide and could cause problems with associates. It would exclude certain arrangements from subsection (4)(g). Subsection (4) defines an associate and subsection (2) defines a controller, but when quantifying the holding of other rights of the person referred to in subsection (2) the definition seems to include all of the person's associates. Under subsection (4)(g), if the putative controller has an agreement with respect to the acquisition or holding of shares of another person, that other person is treated as an associate and all his shares are attributable to that first
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1248</span>
person. The purpose is clearly to cover collusive agreements or the splitting up of holdings so as to remain below the 10 per cent. threshold.<br><br>
The word "custodian" is included because there is an agreement with him concerning the holding of shares, as is a buyer's broker because the first party buying would have an agreement with him to acquire shares on the first party's behalf. The agreement with the custodian or buying broker relates to the same shares of the first individual and it would be wrong to aggregate the holdings of the custodian or the buying broker because of the way in which the definition is interpreted. The Government may be aware that a leading City law firm advised a leading merchant bank some years ago that that would be the effect of provisions such as those that are contained in subsection (4)(g).<br><br>
The Treasury Solicitor is aware of the relevant issues. The wording follows the requirements of the single market directives, but the provisions go much further than is required. They appear in the regulations that implement the insurance directive, the banking directive and the investment services directive. The problem emerged in relation to the insurance directive and the banking directive, and it was raised with the Treasury before the implementation of the investment services directive. The Treasury should therefore be well aware of the problem. New subsection (8) will correct the obvious mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to carve out from the definition of "associate" persons with whom potential controllers have agreements or arrangements concerning share transactions where those agreements or arrangements involve one party acting as the agent or nominee of the other.<br><br>
I understand the rationale for that if a person does not have any discretion about how to vote the shares that he holds, it would appear, on the face of it, that he could not, exercise any control and that he should not be burdened by the requirements of this regime. However, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary explained during the debate on part XI, there is a good practical reason for including those persons in the definition. The FSA may not have any idea about who controls those voting rights, or that votes are being determined by anyone other than the person whose name appears on the register of shareholders. Person X could, for example, not hold any shares in a particular authorised firm in his own name but he could a number of agreements or arrangements with various different persons involving the voting of shares that those persons hold on his behalf which, when aggregated, mean that X can exert significant control over the authorised firm in question. Unless those persons are included as associates, there would be no requirement for X to notify. That would be a most unfortunate loophole.<br><br>
The requirement for the person in whose name those voting rights are to notify the FSA gives it an important regulatory handle. I should point out that the self-regulating organisations rules do not have any carve out for agents or nominees. The definition of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1249</span>
"associate" that they use is equivalent to that which is used in the Bill.<br><br>
The Bill's definition is, in fact, based on what is required by the single market directives, and the amendment would be incompatible with those requirements. In terms of what types of shares and shareholders are covered, the directives are very comprehensive. When defining a qualifying holding, the directives specify that the voting rights referred to in article 7 of the major shareholdings directive should be taken into consideration. That article forms the basis of the definition of "associate" that is used in this context.<br><br>
I will not trouble Committee members with the whole list of voting rights that are provided for in article 7, but I should point out that it includes voting rights that are held by another person, Y, in Y's name but on behalf of X. That covers the case of an agent or nominee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical area. The clause goes further than is required by the single market directives. The Minister's position is not entirely clear. Does the potential risk of creating loopholes mean that the Government are unwilling to consider any form of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1250</span>
carve out for agents and nominees, or was she implicitly saying that the Government have not finished considering the territory? We shall press the amendment to a vote unless we are satisfied that the Government will deal adequately with what I regard as the clause's unnecessary and incorrect provisions.</span></p>
