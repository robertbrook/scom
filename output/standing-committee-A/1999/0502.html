	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Local Government Bill [	<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock except for Thursday 4th May when the Committee shall not meet.</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Michie, and I look forward to serving under your chairmanship. I have not done so before, so I shall not make any predictions. I see that my colleague Mr. O'Brien is to assist you in some of our sittings. Of course, he was in the Chair during some of the proceedings of the Committee that considered the previous Local Government Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committees considering Local Government Bills have a reputation as places where a lot of work is done by many experts. Indeed, there is a high level of expertise on this Committee, and such capability always gives Ministers room for thought. Every Labour Member present has served on a local authority of some nature. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales has done so, but he also has to serve on the Committee considering the Learning and Skills Bill and he will, therefore, sometimes have to leave or rejoin our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Liberal Democrat Committee members have served on local councils and three of the five Conservative Committee members have been members of local government. Four of the Conservative Members have strong London connections. That worries me somewhat; I want to talk about the real world, but I never believe that the real world goes on in London. I am, however, as interested in what goes on in Devon and Cornwall as I am in what occurs in Northumberland. I share the prejudice that one has to be careful about London because it is a special case, so I am concerned that three of the five Conservative Committee members have served on London authorities and that another has served in London health organisations, community health councils and so on. The Wandsworth factor has best inhabited the Tory Benches, as three Opposition Members have close affinities with Wandsworth. One of the Opposition Members has been rescued; he has come to God's own country in the north and is a neighbour of mine. I am pleased that he has seen the light and that he has been rehabilitated to places with which you and I, Mrs. Michie, would be much more familiar than we are with London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Committee members have extensive involvement in local government. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) may not have served on a local authority, but he has served
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
over local authorities; indeed, he gave several servings to local authorities, which brought him great notoriety. Whatever we may think of some of those, he has become the vice-president of the Local Government Association, so his reputation must stand high in this area. I hope that the rest of his party recognise that. On some issues it may be true to say that he stands alone, but on local government he is gaining more support throughout his party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion sets the times and dates for our discussions. I know that right hon. and hon. Members will be—as ever—civilised and constructive. I know, also, that they will recognise that we have a responsibility to ensure that the thousands of councillors and also the people they seek to serve are well served by the framework that we establish. The framework must get the balance between central and local determination right and must show that we treat activities at the local level with the seriousness and respect that they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose that we meet twice daily on Tuesdays and Thursdays under normal circumstances. However, I am not suggesting that we meet this afternoon. These matters have been decided through the usual channels. I understand the wish not to meet this afternoon or on Thursday, because there are other things going on. I would be happy to meet on Thursday, but I can understand why people have decided not to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, a number of members appointed to the Standing Committee raised a number of important points across the range of the Bill's purposes. We now have the opportunity to consider and discuss the whole of the Bill in a more detailed and systematic way and thus put the provisions into context. The legislation builds on and complements the Local Government Act 1999. We have consistently said that we intend a substantial programme of local government reform and that it will take more than one Act of Parliament to deliver that programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts II and III of the Bill have already been the subject of public consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee of Members of both Houses and have already been improved and clarified in the light of recommendations made. I regret that there are some widespread misconceptions about the intentions and the effects of some of the provisions in the Bill. I hope that in Committee we will be able to explain the true intention of the Government in the Bill and also will be able to explain to the wider world what the provisions are really about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government is convinced of the value of scrutiny procedures, which are set out in part II of the Bill. This House is learning to carry out the role of scrutiny more effectively, having introduced the Select Committee system fairly late in the history of our Parliament. None the less, it is changing the way in which the Executive relates to the legislature and the way in which the legislature holds the Executive to account. As the role of local government changes, so the role of scrutiny changes. The fact that the current system does not provide for scrutiny is recognised as a gap in the current legislature. The Committee will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
able to look in detail at how we ensure detailed and constructive scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion is intended to enable good progress with plenty of time for discussion of the detail. We are always keen to find ways to improve legislation because we want to ensure the best for local communities and councils. We in the House have a responsibility to do that so that local government can see that we are dealing constructively with its concerns and not simply trying to score party-political points. In that spirit, I move the sittings motion, which I believe will give us ample time and opportunity properly to scrutinise the Bill and to ensure that scrutiny becomes a more regular feature of local government proceedings. We recognise that local government is waiting for certain aspects of the Bill to be implemented so that it can get on with them, and expects us to be responsible in dealing with such matters. I know that the Committee will want to proceed in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by echoing the Minister's remarks about how pleasant it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie and that of your colleague, Mr. O'Brien. I welcome you both to the Chair for what I hope will be a happy, good natured and constructive Committee. The sittings motion has traditionally become an opportunity for the Opposition to set out their stall and to engage in a preliminary bombardment of the legislation—an opportunity that I shall not waste. I hope that it will be helpful to the Ministers, and to those who whisper in their ears from time to time, if I set out some of the issues that we want to debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, want to refer to the make-up of the Committee and begin by echoing what the Minister said about the expertise deployed on both sides. In particular, I echo her remarks about hon. Members' experience in local government. Of course, there is such a thing as bad, as well as good, experience, which I am sure we shall debate in due course. I am especially impressed, if not awed, by the firepower on our Back Benches, which I am sure will be deployed to good advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, without wishing to sound churlish, I note that the Labour Benches seem to be missing what one might term the parliamentary awkward squad. It seems that in the process of selecting from those who contributed to the Second Reading debate those who are privileged to serve on the Committee, there have been a few fallers. They include the hon. Members for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)—who has enormous experience in local government that is unequalled by that of other Committee members—for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell), for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Dr. Jones), for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith), for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) and for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher), all of whom made good contributions to the Second Reading debate but mysteriously failed to make it on to the Committee. By contrast, several Committee members were unable to contribute to the Second Reading debate, I am sure for very good reasons—perhaps they were washing their hair that day. There is no formal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
rule on the matter, but it is traditional for those who contributed on Second Reading to have the first option of serving on the Committee. It is not for me to speculate on why so many distinguished Labour Members failed to be appointed to the Committee, but it might just have something to do with the fact that almost all of those whom I have named voiced criticisms of the Bill on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it might fall to us on the Conservative Benches to articulate the concerns not only of organisations such as the Local Government Association, Charter 88 and of the newspaper editors—I could go on and on and probably will—but of many Labour councillors and Labour Back Benchers in the House: people who feel let down and excluded by the Government and betrayed by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to improve the Bill. We have tabled a large number of amendments and will be tabling more. I want to touch on a number of issues, but I hope that on balance we can disagree without being disagreeable, as someone cleverer than me once said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of housekeeping issues to raise, to which the Minister may not be able to respond today. She was honest enough to admit on Second Reading that the Bill was unfinished and I had a bit of innocent fun at her expense. I see that some Government amendments have crept on to the amendment paper. Will they be on the same scale as those tabled in another place, where there were more than 400 Government amendments? It was difficult for the Opposition to keep up with the Bill as it changed shape. Subject to one or two other major issues, will we see masses of Government amendments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for draft regulations and guidance, some draft regulations have been produced. Will others become available during the Committee stage and, if so, when? Draft guidance was issued several months ago. The Minister said that a redraft would be issued after Easter. It would help to know the timing of that so that all Committee members can base their speeches on relevant information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We anticipate major U-turns by the Government on at least two matters. It would be better if those happened sooner rather than later. You might be aware, Mrs. Michie, that a great chunk of the Utilities Bill was torn out at a late stage. Although that is not germane to our debate, it would be good not to spend weeks and months grinding through the detail of the Bill only for the Government to pull out major parts of it at the last minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me remind the Committee of our aims. There are local elections on Thursday. The average turnout in places like my constituency will not be much more than 30 per cent. or 35 per cent. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Garston—sadly, not a member of the Committee—made an excellent speech. She talked about the average turnout in local elections in Liverpool which, alarmingly, is below 25 per cent. In a recent by-election, the figure fell to 6 per cent. No one can take comfort from that. The central aim of any self-respecting Bill on local government must be to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
increase voter participation and interest in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party learnt its lessons from government. It believes that more responsibilities and powers should be returned to local government, not only because that is a good in itself, but because it will help to make local government more relevant to the people who do not bother voting. They need to think that local government is important enough for them to go to the polls because it directly affects their council tax, how revenue is raised and spent locally and other major decisions that should be made with little central Government interference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is how we can involve and attract more high-quality candidates to stand in local government elections. When the leader of the Conservative party asked me to do this job, I borrowed a biography of Joseph Chamberlain, who made an enormous success of his business career. One might admire him because, in 1874, he sold his business for £600,000, so he was not without a bob or two. Instead of going into national politics, he wanted to continue in local government. He was four times mayor of Birmingham. What attracted him, and others like him, to local government? It was because local government was expanding, exciting and relevant. Unless, through the Bill or other measures, we can again achieve such excitement and interest—with respect to the luminaries of local government who now find themselves on the Government Benches—we shall not necessarily attract the likes of Joseph Chamberlain as candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may agree on the aims of the Bill, but we have said before and shall no doubt say again that although the Government talk about modernising local government, they offer only a straitjacket for local democracy. We broadly welcome the proposals to set and enforce standards, although we shall have quite a lot to say about the details. We support the abolition of surcharging; it has always been a blunt instrument, which has rarely achieved what was intended. However, we want some form of financial penalty to be introduced and we have tabled at least one amendment to that effect. We will return to that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Whitty rightly said that the structure of local government was central to the Bill, but their Lordships have ripped it out. Not for the first time, they are much more in tune with popular opinion, as much in this matter as in others, than the Government. We say that it is a simple matter of local choice. Excellent recommendations may be made that particular councils should use the cabinet or executive system, which is the option that most councils will have to adopt, but the advantages of that system should be self-evident; it should at least be chosen on its merits, not imposed on local councils by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, this is a centralising, interfering and nannying Government, particularly when it comes to local government. It is no wonder that Sir Jeremy Beecham, the Labour head of the LGA, spoke about the strange death of local democracy. It was clear on

Second Reading that Labour Back Benchers had many reservations about the proposals on structures. It will be interesting to discover whether they will voice some of those concerns in Committee. Many other bodies oppose the proposals, including the Newspaper Publishers Association, Charter 88 and the Labour Campaign for Open Local Government. It will be interesting to hear the Minister deflect those criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stripped of rhetoric and verbiage, it will be difficult for Ministers to justify imposing that limited menu of structures on local councils. It is wrong that people should not be allowed the fourth option, which is sometimes called the status quo, because the committee system has moved on a lot since I was a councillor. We should be able to consider other options. Why cannot such matters be left to a vigorous and active local democracy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee stage unfolds and pressures are placed on Ministers not only by Labour Back-Bench members of the Committee one lives in hope—but by other Back Benchers and by bodies such as the LGA, I wonder whether there will be a change of policy and, if so, how it will be dressed up. The Minister was pretty clear on Second Reading. There seemed to be little room for manoeuvre, but the policy may change as we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Government going to do about the amendments passed in the other place? I assume that the Minister still takes the view that she expressed on Second Reading. As yet, I have seen no amendments to deal with that matter but, if the Minister wants to tell us in her reply to the debate, it would be interesting to hear precisely what the Government's intentions are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Directly-elected mayors are a fascinating issue on which I hope that we have some interesting debates. In some circumstances, directly-elected mayors can be useful and appropriate. Whether London is the best place to pilot the idea will become more apparent as the week wears on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said before, we broadly welcome the new power to be given to local councils, as do the LGA and other local government bodies. It is a litmus test of the Government's intentions towards local government. They have backed away from a general power of competence. Indeed, their general approach is rather hesitant and nervous, which has not been lost on expert commentators in the local government press. The truth is that the Government do not trust local government. Many Labour-controlled councils are part of the problem and not part of the solution. Much of the attitude of No. 10 towards local government reform is driven by a fear and distrust of Labour-controlled councils. That is why the new power is hedged around with restrictions, where wide-ranging powers of regulation are given to the Secretary of State. Crucially, there will be no revenue-raising capability or extra funding to back up the new power. It is loosely drafted and we will have something to say on that in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is important to all the debates that we will have. This new power—and the clauses in part I that deal with it—lies across a developing and serious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
fault line within Government over the role of local government. At present, two armed camps within the Government are arguing over the future of local government. On the one hand, the "Front Line First" brigade argues that local government is part of the problem and not part of the solution. It argues that the Government should find ways—whether on policing, health or a range of other matters—to bypass local government and send funding direct to the coal face so to speak. A number of bodies within the Government, not least No. 10 apparently, take that position. That has created a howl of protest from the LGA among others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the argument can be called the joined-up government brigade. It believes that for democracy to work one needs not only joined-up central Government—that holy grail, which moves ever further away the nearer the Government try to get to it—but also joined-up local government. The delivery of services is looked at in a holistic way. Local government is seen as the engine, the leader of community planning, in its own area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not hear much of that battle in Committee, but it will have a major effect on the way in which our debate develops. It will come to a head in the comprehensive spending review in July, but it is already raging throughout Whitehall. Perhaps the Minister will tell us which side of the argument she is on. Otherwise, we can examine her remarks for telltale signs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the vexed issue of section 28, we have already said that we regret the Government's determination to force repeal through as part of the Bill. We have always suspected that the Government have done so to draw attention away from the massive changes that the Bill will make to local democracy. We do not wish to spend a great deal of time and energy on the issue. It was a superficial political ploy and it has severely backfired on the Government. As I said on Second Reading, they have fallen back on the final line of defence: the lawyers, who are saying one of two things. They are no longer saying that the legislation is dreadful and should be repealed. They are saying that it no longer applies to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statement from the Secretary of State has mysteriously appeared on the front page of the Bill: he is unable to say that the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the European convention on human rights. The mystery has yet to be explained. [	<i>Interruption.]</i> I heard a "Hear, hear!" The statement might be right. I am not one of the growing band of human rights lawyers who seem to be developing their practices on the back of some of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading and during subsequent questioning, the Minister was pressed on the matter by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay). That hon. Gentleman has also failed to make it to the starting line; I wonder why. I used to be a Whip, so perhaps the answer is self-explanatory. The hon. Gentleman asked, as I did, what the possible basis could be for that characteristically opaque statement.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
He pressed the matter again in a subsequent written question. The Minister again answered:
	<br><blockquote><p>The Government do not normally publish their legal advice.</p></blockquote>
The longish answer continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>The Bill on introduction to the Lords was, in our opinion, compatible with the ECHR. However, clause 91 of the … Bill amends, and thereby reaffirms, the provisions of section 2A. By extension, this amendment casts doubt on whether the Bill is now compatible with the ECHR.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 April 2000; Vol. 348, c.318–319.]</p></blockquote>
That was said to be the basis for the statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of law as much as of common sense, the Opposition do not understand the statement. The provision now concerns only the deterring of bullying. One would have thought that there was common ground on that subject. If not today then in the near future, will one of the Ministers say why they now claim that there is a problem when one did not exist before? What is the basis of and evidence for the problem? Will they please consider publishing the opinion that they surely obtained on the subject? Opposition Members are extremely puzzled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government please abandon the ill-advised attempt to repeal that legislation? I ask that not least because it is one of the big issues in the Bill, about which there is much spinning to suggest that they will not carry it through. I would not like hon. Members to spend much time debating that issue or others that the Government do not intend to pursue. Is there truth in a report on 25 April in 	<i>The Independent</i> or in similar media reports that the Government intend to shelve the proposal until after the next election? Is there truth in the spinning that No. 10 is heartily sick of the issue and would like it to be dropped?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be the last to know if that part of Bill is not to be pursued. However, there is little excuse for the matter not being dealt with in good time. It arises almost at the end of the Bill, which is relatively long and contains many far more important issues than the one that I have been describing. We look forward to debating the Bill, as I am sure that the Ministers do. As it changes shape—perhaps for reasons beyond the Committee's control—we will continue to try to make it a better Bill under your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie, and that of your colleague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mrs. Michie, and Mr. O'Brien to the Chair. I am sure that you will keep us in order during the proceedings in the next few weeks. I reiterate the observation on the expertise of members of the Committee. That expertise comes not only from hon. Members' experience of serving on local authorities but from their knowledge of the Bill's forerunners—the machinations, the consultation papers and the previous attempts at the reform of local government upon which much of the Bill is based. Indeed, since the middle of the previous century, when local government became what we know it to be today, central Government have messed around with the concept. In that sense, we are faced with little that is new. Some Committee members will remember, or will have read about, Richard Crossman's proposals for wholesale changes during the late 1960s and Peter Walker's Bill,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
during the Heath Government, which got rid of urban and rural district councils, not to mention Margaret Thatcher's abolition of the Greater London Council and metropolitan councils and the stripping away of many powers that councils had enjoyed until then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The origins of the Bill start not with the election of a Labour Government in 1997, but can be traced back to the time following the rise of the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) to Prime Minister and his appointment of the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) as Secretary of State for the Environment late in 1990, when yet another comprehensive review of local government in England was undertaken by the Department of the Environment. The first two arms of that review led to the replacement of the community charge or "poll tax" with the council tax and the creation of the Local Government Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third arm of the review concentrated on the decision-making process in local government. It received less attention at the time, but seems to have had a lasting influence on ideas for reinvigorating local government. The Department of the Environment consultation paper of July 1991, "The Internal Management of Local Authorities in England", made several suggestions designed to promote more effective, speedy and business-like decision making, to enhance the scrutiny of decisions—the first time that that word found its way into local government reforms—to increase the interest taken by the public in local government and to provide scope for councillors to devote more time to their constituency or ward role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the first time that cabinets were mentioned was in that consultation paper. It referred to directly-elected cabinets, a council manager and directly-elected mayors At that time, it seems that elected mayors and other forms of decision making in local government, which were strongly supported by the right hon. Member for Henley, stood a good chance of being implemented. Then, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) succeeded the right hon. Member for Henley as Secretary of State for the Environment and established another departmental working group to consider current practice and suggestions for improving internal management arrangements and to investigate possible experimental models. The working party reported in July 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the changes proposed in the consultation paper and the working party report required legislation, but time was never made available for it and the working party's proposals were not implemented. In October 1996, the then local government Minister, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, said that of all the responses received to the July 1991 consultation paper, not a single county council, district council, London borough or metropolitan borough was in favour of elected mayors. Nevertheless, the idea continued to surface time and again as people considered local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
In July 1996, the House of Lords Select Committee on Relations between Central and Local Government, chaired by Lord Hunt of Tanworth, called on the Conservative Government to find, as a matter of urgency, parliamentary time to legislate to enable local authorities to experiment with internal management. That is the background—ideas framed under a Conservative Government being implemented by a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the official Opposition, we want to improve the Bill. We want openness and true accountability. We want powers and not merely duties and responsibilities to be passed down the line to local government. Resources should be available to back up those duties and responsibilities and enable local authorities to use their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to test the need for some of the reforms introduced by the Bill and to ask questions about the dangers of concentrating powers in the hands of fewer people as part of an executive cabinet or in the hands of one person in the form of an elected mayor. We are also concerned about the danger of the reforms making local government less open. In some of the experimental management systems that have been introduced, the press, the public and Opposition councillors have sometimes found that they have been even less included in decisions than they were under the previous system. There is a danger that the reforms will make local government become less interesting to potential candidates and to the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe in what the Government say that they want to do and we support some of their proposals wholeheartedly. However, the important question is whether the case has been put for the necessity of the reforms and whether they are right for achieving the Government's stated aims. During the coming weeks, the Liberal Democrats will table a number of amendments to deal with various aspects of the Bill. We hope to push the Minister, in the nicest possible way, to come clean on what she believes the Bill will achieve and on whether we will be able to test some of the presumptions that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats are keen to point out that the origins of the Bill are not in modernisation for a new millennium from a new Government. They are old and worn-out ideas that come from a previous Administration and which have been dressed up as a new approach for local government in the 21st century. We shall try during the coming weeks to improve some of those dusty old ideas and to help local government to achieve the renaissance that everyone wants. People want communities to come together and get involved in decisions that affect their lives. We also want a vibrant local democracy that can meet community needs and which will ensure less centralised control over what should be local decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I feel that I am unique in this Committee, as I appear to be the only hon. Member present who has never served on a local authority. The accolades handed out by the Minister suggest that there are two qualifications for membership of the Committee. The first is that one must dislike London thoroughly. I entirely share the Minister's view in that respect; I do not represent London and I cannot understand why anyone voluntarily lives in it. Why anyone should want to be mayor of London entirely defeats me. I cannot understand, however, why the Minister described London as not being the real world. People who have to walk up and down the escalators at King's Cross because they are not working or to queue for 40 yards to reach a ticket machine on the London underground will not agree with her. If she were to tell such people that they were not living in the real world, she might receive one or two explanations of how the definition of the real world might impinge upon Londoners, as opposed to the right hon. Lady, who represents North-West Durham. Even so, I rather share her general view on London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a member of a local authority and, on the whole, I share the Minister's views about London. I have a third qualification, which may also be unique: I am bored rigid by section 28 and the debate about it. I cannot get excited about this blasted thing, either way. I hope that there will be long notice of when we come to it, and that I can bring into the Room such reading matter as you will permit me to indulge in, Mrs. Michie, so that I shall not find the time entirely wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served on a Committee with the Minister when she managed the previous Local Government Bill. It was such an exciting and stimulating experience that I could not refrain from serving on this Committee. Indeed, I rejected the importunings and supplications of the Whips to serve on other Bills so that I might reserve myself for this one, knowing that I would again have the pleasure of listening to the right hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that perhaps one or two Labour Members who spoke on Second Reading might be on the Committee, but I can understand why they are not. The right hon. Lady roundly told them that they were representative of a failed system. The whole system had completely failed, and they had obviously been catastrophic failures in their own right. They were so deeply discouraged that they did not want to come here and hear such comments day in, day out, week after week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Labour Members sitting behind the right hon. Lady will not be too discouraged by the constant diet of being told what a waste of time the old system was and how necessary it is to have root-and-branch reform. The Government Whip, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), is a man of subtlety who uses gentle means of persuasion, but even with his diplomacy and tact, he might find it difficult to retain some of his colleagues in the Committee if they are subject to psychological stress relating to their dismal role in events up to this defining moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
I am delighted—I am not sure of the etiquette for this—to see some old faces and friends on the Minister's support squad. I look forward to her rendering of their notes. Even without knowing who sent them, I think that I will be able to detect the author from the prose style. It is pleasant to sit in Committee and spot one's former official by the nature of the notes that are transmitted. One or two officials have, through various events in their lives that are not related to the Government, become more substantial figures since they served on the previous Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a pleasant surprise. The explanatory notes, which are usually more opaque than the Bill, are verging on useful. Reading the Bill gets one practically nowhere, but reading the explanatory notes usually sends one backwards. It is like reading a translation of the Old Testament in a foreign language. However, these explanatory notes almost give useful information on what is in the Bill. I am most grateful to the person who is responsible for setting that dangerous precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue is that of structures. The Government say that the old system does not work. That depends on the criteria used to judge it, such as turnout or innovative capacity. A range of criteria can be used. We must be cautious before we accept that a substitute will improve matters. I have serious doubts that the turnout in local authority elections will be influenced more than marginally by anything that we do in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Government are to prescribe structures, it is important that they should have a reason for doing so. It is easy to dismiss the status quo. I agree that in many respects the system does not deliver well. That is why, as the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) said, the previous Government introduced an ideas paper. They asked local government to reflect on what it might like to do. It was so shattered by the concept of the Government asking it what it thought, rather than telling it what to do, that it never made any suggestions. Local government was struck rigid by the sheer trauma of being asked for its opinion. Its response was that it did not want to do anything. If we are to challenge local government's unwillingness to shift, the Government must demonstrate what will be gained and where.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to insist on a referendum if a local electorate does not stimulate one. He could invite the local electorate to oblige the local authority to adopt a different solution. If that is the case, the Government must have—by definition—some notion of when that power would be used. I hope that during the course of the debate, the Minister will give us the names of at least half a dozen local authorities that she thinks would benefit from having a directly elected mayor. That would be interesting. As the hon. Member for Torbay has said, many local authorities have anticipated the Bill by adopting a cabinet system: Liverpool, which the hon. Member for Torbay's party controls, has already adopted a cabinet system, as has Leeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question is what those authorities are doing about their management structures. Are they ensuring that there are effective management structures below
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
the level of political decision making? The Minister will need to explain why a council that has beacon status is not efficient enough to maintain the system which led to its receiving that status. Why does a beacon council, which by definition is excellent, have to change? Is that council not good enough? Has it not made the best of existing structures? Despite being given those accolades by the Government, it still has to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue we have to discuss is how scrutiny will work. There are two aspects to scrutiny. The first involves making it intrinsically interesting and creative enough so that elected members perceive scrutiny as a fulfilling role. That is not going to be easy. Local government members are likely to see their job as being to support their people. In Liverpool, there are difficulties because members of the scrutiny committees have not yet adopted the mentality that they are there to check on their own colleagues. Equally, local government officials have a dilemma in that they are being asked to service both an executive and a scrutiny function. Officials are genuinely concerned about how they are to respond to serving those two functions simultaneously. We need some explanation of how the system will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to our debate. I am grateful that the Thursday sittings have been brought forward in the afternoon, which reflects the different hours Parliament has been working. I wish they could have been brought forward even further because, when you are travelling by car, if you are not out of London by 3 pm on a Thursday, you are stuck till 7 pm. [	<i>Laughter.]</i> I would have been willing to start at 7.30 on Thursday morning and have both sittings before lunch. My constituency is so large that, if I travel there by train, I end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The car is the only practical means I have for travelling around my constituency, which is the second or third largest constituency in the country—[	<i>Interruption.]</i> That is the wrong station. Which station should I use? If I want to go to Settle, there is no point in leaving my car in Leeds or Northallerton or somewhere like that. The change to the Committee's hours is practical and a move in the right direction. I am grateful for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the debate. The Minister has a choice to make, as she knows. She has a majority behind her and she can roll the Bill through. She and the Whip both know that she could decline to engage in a debate. However, the Minister has said that she wants a debate. Given that we are relatively few on this side, she can choose between being a steamroller or a juggernaut, and engaging in a debate. We have no desire to keep the Committee going for longer than is necessary for the proper purposes of the debate, but we do want to hear from the Minister why she believes that the measures are necessary and how she thinks they will work. We want the sort of explanation from her that the people who will have to manage the system in the end are looking to us to obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mrs. Michie, I look forward to the coming weeks under your stewardship and that of Mr. O'Brien. I

have no doubt that the Committee will be genial, though taxing from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my Whip is muttering under his breath, "If only she wouldn't engage in debate." I think I have a reputation for engaging in debate while remaining determined to ensure the Government gets its business through. As I said in my opening remarks, we want to ensure that people clearly understand the Government's aims and objectives. They are the result of our determination to open up local government, to make it more relevant and accountable and to make it an active, democratic tier of government. As I said in our debates on the Local Government Act 1999, we are constantly refining and redefining the relationship between central Government and local government to ensure sure that it is effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not respond to what the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) admitted were churlish remarks about the Committee's membership. For instance, I wondered why the right hon. Member for Henley was not a member of the Committee, given his splendid speech on the Bill in the Queen's Speech debate. Whips on both sides have to consider what other activities hon. Members are engaged in, and therefore who can be members of the Committee, but I am absolutely confident that all Labour Members will be effective in what they say about local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne spoke about the management of the Bill, particularly about the tabling of amendments. The Bill is one of several that were published in draft and considered by a Joint Select Committee. Significant amendments were made in the other place, which reflect some of the changes suggested by the Joint Committee. That Committee played a full part; I and many others appeared before it, and the Government wanted to take full account of its deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the amendments made in the other place were designed to bring parts II and III into line with the recommendations of the Joint Committee, which considered the draft Bill during the summer. The Government considered the Committee's recommendations in the autumn and we accepted a significant number of them. We therefore tabled amendments to give effect to those recommendations. We have also tabled amendments that better reflect the policy set out in the White Paper, "Local Leadership, Local Choice".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendments tabled at later stages in the other place were largely in response to issues raised by members of the Conservative party. One of them, pushed also by the Liberal Democrats, introduced a duty instead of a power, so I was a little concerned to hear that I may be asked to change that back from a duty to a power—again by Liberal Democrat Members. Perhaps they will get together to work that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave due notice on Second Reading that amendments will need to be made. We obviously want to ensure that the Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights. It is rather strange that the hon. Member for Eastbourne did not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
understand what I have said on several occasions, which is that clause 91 reaffirms section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986. It does not simply talk about bullying; it adds something. Reaffirming section 2A meant that were unable to say that the Bill as drafted was compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998. The previous Government did not take account of it or take it seriously in their legislation. As we have said, we shall comment on compatibility with the 1998 Act in each of our Bills, and we have taken legal advice in making such comments. The Bill reaffirms section 2A, which we believe is at least challengeable under the European convention on human rights, so we are not convinced that the Bill as it stands is compatible with the European convention. I hope that the hon. Gentleman now understands that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to restore the basis on which councils must change to a more efficient, transparent and accountable system that is able to meet the challenges of modern governance. We hope to table amendments that make clear our response to the Lords' amendments which, as I said on Second Reading, were completely contradictory. Even if we accepted some of the amendments, they would still be contradictory and we cannot leave the Bill as it is. We want to table amendments to sort that problem out as soon as possible; indeed, we hope to do so this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the majority of the amendments that we intend to table will make technical, consequential or minor drafting changes. They will ensure that the legislation works effectively—it is our responsibility to produce effective legislation—and set the scene for genuine change in the way in which councils serve their local communities. We will ensure that sufficient time is provided for consideration of the Bill and of the amendments. We have already produced drafts of some of the key regulations and guidance that we intend to make under the Bill to clarify the Government's intentions for the legislation. We will continue to update and expand those documents as the Bill proceeds through Parliament. Hon. Members know that during the passage of the previous Local Government Bill, I sought to ensure that they received information as soon as it was available. I shall do the same now. An inordinate amount of work is going into the Bill. The redrafting of the initial guidance has taken into consideration responses made to the initial draft. We will publish another draft before the Committee considers the relevant clauses and I shall ensure that Committee members receive the information as soon as it is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne is right to say that we want to ensure that local people perceive the relevance of local government and identify with the way in which it works and therefore feel that it is worth coming out to vote. We have seen an improvement in the status and value that people attach to local government go side by side with our reforms in how people can vote. A number of interesting experiments are being conducted this week to encourage people to use their right to vote more widely. We are not saying that people should vote more often; we are simply saying that voting early
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
might be a good idea. I hope that we will at least see some movement in the areas where the pilots are being conducted. Such schemes are merely a part of our commitment to ensuring that local government is restored to a more rightful place in our democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne also mentioned standards. He needs to go back to the history books a little if he wants to repeat the suggestion that "we" have always thought that surcharge was the wrong way of doing things. I hate to remind him that the Conservatives introduced the surcharge when in government and continued to pursue it. I do not know who the "we" were. He might simply have been trying to deny any knowledge and understanding of anything that happened before 1 May 1997. However, some of us have longer memories and some of my hon. Friends will be looking forward to telling the hon. Gentleman of some of their memories of the way in which the previous Government dealt with them. We want to get rid of surcharge, but we want a robust system of upholding standards in local government. That is in the interests of democracy as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised other issues concerning structures. I reject the assertion that we are offering a straitjacket. We will be able to debate the question more as the Committee proceeds. I have already said a fair amount about the amendments that we will table.

I would hate 	<i>Hansard</i> to record that I dislike London—far from it. In response to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, I note that I am concerned only that London does not dominate people's perceptions of local government in the rest of the country. It does so far too often because the media are based in London and it is seen as the example of everything else that goes on in the rest of the country. It does not serve as an example and should not be seen as representing the way in which things work elsewhere. The right hon. Gentleman has part of Harrogate in his constituency, as well as the beauties of North Yorkshire. There are one or two escalators in Harrogate. I do not think that there is a single escalator in North-West Durham—escalators are not the main concern of folk there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am concerned that Conservative Committee members' main local government experience comes from London. I hope that they will understand that London is not the same as the rest of the country in terms of local government. We will be looking to inject experience and knowledge of places further afield, although some of the lessons for what we are doing might have come from our experiences in London. Indeed, the borough in which we are meeting has some interesting lessons that we might all learn regarding local Government. We clearly have lots of interesting things to talk about and deal with, hope fully in good humour. We will be able to proceed through further modernisation of local government so that it means

something to the people for whom it should mean something—the local electors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Local Government Bill [	<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock except for Thursday 4th May when the Committee shall not meet.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that a financial resolution is connected with the Bill. Copies are available in Committee. I should also like to remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those reached during an afternoon sitting. I now call the Minister to move the order of consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 8, new Clauses relating to Part I, new Schedules so
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
relating, Clauses 9 to 22, Schedule 1, Clauses 23 to 38, Schedule 2, Clauses 39 to 44, new Clauses relating to Part II, new Schedules so relating, Clauses 88 to 90, Clauses 45 to 52, Clause 75, Clause 53, Schedule 3, Clauses 54 to 74, Clauses 76 and 77, new Clauses relating to Part III, new Schedules so relating, Clauses 84 and 85, Clauses 78 to 83, new Clauses relating to Part IV, new Schedules so relating, Clauses 86 and 87, Clauses 91 to 94, Schedules 4 and 5, Clauses 95 and 96, remaining new Clauses, remaining new Schedules.</p></blockquote>
The order provides a simple and straightforward way to proceed through the Bill's provisions and proposals for new provisions. It associates schedules with the clauses that give them effect. It provides for the provisions in part V that relate to parts II and III to be considered in relation to those parts of the Bill. In particular, the order enables the Committee to consider the provisions in part III logically.

I hope that that is agreeable and finds favour with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
