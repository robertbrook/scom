COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL: ACCESS TO INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take new clause 1—<i>Comptroller and Auditor General-right of access to information</i>—
<br><blockquote><p><ol><li>'This section applies for the purposes of the examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the accounts of government departments and other bodies under or by virtue of—</li>
<ol>
<li>this Act, or</li>
<li>the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921, or</li>
<li>any other enactment, or</li>
<li>any arrangement between such department or body and some other body which provides for the accounts of that body to be subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</li></ol>
<li>The Comptroller and Auditor General—</li>
<ol>
<li>shall have a right of access at all reasonable times to all accounting records and other documents relating to—</li>
<ol>
<li>such accounts, or</li>
<li>separately, any money originating in the Consolidated Fund or Exchequer grant, and</li>
<li>any payments funded by money that would otherwise be payable into the Consolidated Fund.</li></ol>
<li>shall be entitled to require from any person holding or accountable for any such document any assistance, information or explanation which he reasonably requires.</li></ol>
<li>Without prejudice to any other rights vested in the Comptroller and Auditor General, the rights conferred by subsections (2) and (3) are also exercisable against, a receiving body to the same extent as similar rights are exercisable against the receiving body by a paying body.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding subsection (3), the rights conferred by subsection (2) are not exercisable against any paying body or receiving body the accounts of which are subject to audit under section 2 of the Audit Commission Act 1998 other than a body specified in section 98(1) of the National Health Service Act 1977.</li>
<li>The following provisions shall cease to have effect—</li>
<ol>
<li>section 28 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 (access to departments' documents);</li>
<li>section 9(2) of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921 (application of section 28 of 1866 Act).</li></ol>
<li>"Paying body" means any body which pays to a receiving body money originating in the Consolidated Fund or Exchequer grant.</li>
<li>"Receiving body" means any body which receives from a paying body money originating in the Consolidated Fund or Exchequer grant.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Davis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Haltemprice and Howden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My primary emphasis shall be on new clause 1.I apologise to the Minister because I shall speak at length; I hope that she will accept that the Public Accounts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
Committee regards the issue as substantive and requiring proper treatment.<br><br>
Before I start on the technical matters—they are technical and, by the same measure, extremely important—I should say that those of us privileged to be MPs come here for various purposes, all of which fit within a couple of guidelines. We are here to exercise power, often on behalf of the powerless, and to exercise our authority and strength on behalf of the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. In doing that as parliamentarians, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the people working for him producing National Audit Office reports act as our eyes and ears. The new clause would ensure that the NAO, acting as Parliament's eyes and ears in terms of access, could achieve the aims first envisaged for it in the original Exchequer and Audit Department Acts 1866, 1921 and 1957, and in the National Audit Act 1983. I should deal with the new clause on that premise.<br><br>
Clause 9 deals with the rights of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The clear intent of the legislation to be amended by the Bill was to give absolute access to all Government expenditure, which was spent exclusively by Departments. Subsequently, there have been considerable changes in the machinery of Government, especially in recent decades. Increasingly, departmental activities, functions and the delivery of departmental programmes are handled by bodies at arm's length from Ministers or are contracted out to private sector suppliers. Many of the new forms of delivery have the goal of more efficient and effective delivery of departmental programmes. The Public Accounts Committee shares that goal.<br><br>
The changes have, however, resulted in serious gaps in the accountability to Parliament of Government spending. Far from meeting the original intention of the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts to ensure parliamentary accountability for all departmental expenditure, the Bill will set in concrete the weaknesses that have developed.<br><br>
Clause 9 is unsatisfactory. The Exchequer and Auditor Acts vested the powers of access directly in the Comptroller and Auditor General and could be, and were, interpreted as providing him with rights to papers outside the Department. The 1866 Act says that, for his audit of Departments:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Comptroller and Auditor General shall have free access, at all convenient times to the books of accounts and other documents relating to the accounts."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can clear up one point before my right hon. Friend continues. I suspect that it will be material to his argument and to his response. Has the Comptroller and Auditor General always been able to employ private sector auditors when that seems to be an appropriate means of enforcing his jurisdiction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. Often, the National Audit Office employs private sector auditors because it is unnecessary to have the NAO's own skills, because extra skills are required or because a distant light touch must be exercised. It is important that the Comptroller and Auditor General can direct audits, a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0433">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
point to which I shall return in detail when I consider regularity.<br><br>
Clause 9 is restrictive—it specifically makes Departments the gateway through which the Comptroller and Auditor General must gain access to the information required. The difference between the old and the new legislation may be subtle, but substituting powers directly invested in the Comptroller and Auditor General with gateways through which he must pass diminishes his independence.<br><br>
The clause is unsatisfactory because it repeals, without supplying an equivalent provision, section 9(2) of the Exchequer and Audit Department Act 1921. Section 9 provides the only statutory basis for the Comptroller and Auditor General's powers of information and documents within many executive, non-departmental public bodies today. The statutes that established those bodies provided for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be appointed auditor, but did not make provision for his access to documents and information. The Comptroller and Auditor General relied on section 9(2), which provided for the access powers enjoyed in relation to departmental appropriation accounts, for powers applying to the other accounts that he audited.<br><br>
The Treasury and other Departments must have accepted the Comptroller and Auditor General having such access to documents and information as they made no special provision in audit clauses of the Acts establishing the bodies. Through the repeal of section 9(2) of the 1921 Act, the powers and role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in several important executive and non-departmental public bodies will be thrown into doubt. They include many of the 19 bodies that the Government have established, including the new Legal Services Commission, the regional development agencies and the General Teaching Council. I have previously complimented them on having made him the auditor of the bodies.<br><br>
The most important weakness is that clause 9 does not take into account the need to update the legislation to provide the Comptroller and Auditor General with the access needed to provide Parliament with similar levels of independent assurance over departmental expenditure as could be provided in 1866.<br><br>
Despite the Government's claim that the measure is modernising, the Bill confines the Comptroller and Auditor General's powers of access to information within the walls of Departments as if Government machinery had stayed the same since 1921. The need to bring Government accounting into the 21st century is recognised, but nothing is done to update the rights of Parliament from those of the 19th century. It locks in place a reduction in the assurance that Parliament receives over departmental expenditure because of recent changes in the ways in which Government deliver public services.<br><br>
I should like, first, to explain the changes and their impact on Parliament's scrutiny of the Executive; secondly; to turn to the arguments used against the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
Committee's proposed improvements; thirdly, to consider the arguments against addressing them in the Bill; and, finally, to explain the new clause in detail.<br><br>
The main new bodies that conduct functions on behalf of Government fall into two main categories: first, there are private sector companies delivering contracted-out activities, such as the computer centre that processes £4 billion of civil service pay a year. Departments are committed to pay more than £70 billion over 25 years to private finance initiative contractors. Secondly, there are bodies in the independent and voluntary sectors that provide public services, often delivered at a local level, which are largely or wholly funded by Departments or funding bodies. They include housing associations that help to deliver social housing programmes that are worth more than £1 billion a year on behalf of the Housing Corporation.<br><br>
Parliament has the right to expect the same standards of probity and regularity in the use of public funds wherever they are spent. Payment of public funds to service deliverers may be irregular or represent poor value for money if the services have not been delivered satisfactorily. Through existing powers of access to Departments, the Comptroller and Auditor General can examine the checks that Departments have made on the financial management or performance of service deliverers to which they have delegated responsibility. Such assessments may not provide adequate evidence for the Comptroller and Auditor General to reach an independent view.<br><br>
It is worth giving examples of the circumstances in which the Comptroller and Auditor General needs independent access. The Department of Health pays about £140 million a year to provide milk for young children. Most of that sum reimburses retailers for milk that is supplied in exchange for tokens that are issued to parents in receipt of family credit or income support. The Department contracts out the processing of claims by retailers to the private sector, which is reasonable enough. The National Audit Office needs to examine systems and records that are held by the contractor to confirm that payments are being made only to those eligible under the scheme and at legal rates. In other countries, such schemes are characteristically afflicted by fraud. That is not a small consideration.<br><br>
Another example is the Prison Service contractors who run three prisons that are designed, constructed, managed and financed under the private finance initiative. Payments made by the Prison Service to the contractors depend in part on the number of prison cells that are made available. The Comptroller and Auditor General needs to be able to verify independently that the prison cells exist and that procedures operated by the Prison Service to monitor cell availability are sufficiently robust to support contractors' claims. The access of the National Audit Office to public sector prisons is automatic, but to private sector prisons it is by negotiation, which I shall cover in detail in a moment. Relying on departmental assessments, checks and controls means accepting a Department's assurances that its performance is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0434">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
satisfactory. That does not meet the requirement of independent audit.<br><br>
I find it difficult to understand how the Government can accept that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have to negotiate his way into such organisations. When he has no statutory right of access to such bodies, he is dependent on the body and its sponsoring Department for access, which he has to negotiate on an individual basis. That is administratively burdensome. It diminishes his independence and impedes scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee on behalf of the House.<br><br>
I want to share with the Committee the most notable examples of the frustration that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee faced as a result of the problems caused by depending on administrative arrangements that were granted at the behest of Departments and the Treasury. It took five years of negotiation before they obtained access to the Housing Corporation and other executive non-departmental public bodies. The Comptroller and Auditor General was unable to provide the Public Accounts Committee with an assurance that Camelot had correctly handed over national proceeds of the lottery for four years because the company and its auditors refused to provide the evidence. The behaviour of the Office of the National Lottery has recently been criticised by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Perhaps the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) will remind the Committee of those exciting events, almost all of which happened without the co-operation of the bodies concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my right hon. Friend will let us know—this may be gross ignorance on my part—what happens if the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot obtain access to a particular body, such as Camelot, for a prolonged period. Will the PAC, as Parliament's representative, have power to compel the company or agency in question to appear before it? Can it interrogate the private sector auditors of such a body?</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Public Accounts Committee has the right to summon people and papers. As they say in American police movies, there is the easy way and the hard way, and such procedure is the hard way. The PAC has sometimes exercised those powers, but the problem referred to was resolved by a Bill relating to Oflot that was passing through the House at the time. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport was sympathetic to our arguments and understood only too well the problems that we faced, so we were able to obtain access.<br><br>
It is not always the case, however, that convenient legislation is passing through the House, and the Minister concerned may not always have the same interests as the House of Commons, although he did in respect of Oflot. The PAC can act in the way described by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and adopt the brutal and tough means of using the House's powers to summon people and papers. During the past few years, we have perhaps
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
used those powers more than previously, but they are not the proper way of arranging a system for the whole of the Government. We have to exercise the powers in respect of one of the 50 reports that the PAC produces every year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman made an interesting point. He said that the Bill that became the National Lottery Act 1998 happened to be passing through the House at the time and was a convenient means of dealing with the matter, on which agreement could be obtained. Does he think it a happy coincidence that the Bill before us is passing through the House? Could we not use this opportunity, which has fortuitously come before us, to make the changes that we want?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and he would be surprised if I did not. The problem is, however, almost the converse of the point that he made. If the opportunity provided by the Bill is not taken, we will have no chance in the foreseeable future to introduce such legislation unless my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset was right this morning to speak about another Bill on resource accounting. This opportunity is not merely fortuitous, it is the only one, and we would be remiss not to take it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that accepting the amendments suggested—which would meet one of the complaints that Ministers have made—would in no way delay the implementation of resource accounting? They would help the PAC and Parliament but would not have the slightest impact on the rate at which the new system is introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right. I shall return to the matter of consultation later, but we should bear in mind that the Public Accounts Committee could have been properly consulted and the Bill could have passed through a special stage in one or two meetings. Its passage would not have been delayed and its quality could have been greatly improved.<br><br>
Before I was distracted by interventions, I was giving the Committee examples of problems encountered by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the PAC. It took several years of negotiation for the Government to provide the Comptroller and Auditor General with access to training and enterprise companies. Having obtained access, the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported four times on weaknesses in the financial control of such bodies, which are serious and important organisations.<br><br>
Those weaknesses have been shown up only by the Comptroller and Auditor General's involvement. The Government have refused the Comptroller and Auditor General access to private train operators, despite the fact that the PAC considers such access necessary independently to verify on Parliament's behalf that Government regulation of the rail industry is being implemented efficiently. The regulators are all officially overseen by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0435">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
fail to provide the Comptroller and Auditor General with powers to visit farmers and traders to check their claims under the common agricultural policy, despite the fact that the accuracy and validity of grant claims made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food can be confirmed only by site visits. However, staff of the European Court of Auditors, which is not exactly at the zenith of the profession, can make visits to farms in the United Kingdom as they have power of access to the final recipients of European Community funds. I have no doubt that the Committee will find it anomalous that European institutions should have greater powers of scrutiny over public funds in the UK than our Parliament in Westminster.<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee has also been frustrated over its scrutiny of public funds for the royal palaces. In December 1992, following the fire at Windsor castle on 20 November, the Committee asked the National Audit Office to report on expenditure on the maintenance of the occupied royal palaces. Since 1991–92, that expenditure has been covered by grant in aid to the royal household, but that arrangement did not provide access for the CAG, and it was not until 1998 that full access was granted to him. I am a latecomer to this discussion, but I have to say that the direct effect of access being granted has been a considerable improvement in the efficiency of operation of parts of the royal household.<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee can ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine only those registered social landlords or housing associations that volunteer access. Housing associations are highly unlikely to extend an invitation to him. Hon. Members might be interested to learn that a Member of Parliament brought irregularities in a housing association's actions to the attention of the CAG, but that it took six months for access to be arranged for him to inspect the housing association in question. That case is now under criminal investigation, so I shall not identify it more closely, but the Committee intends to issue a report in due course. The arrangements for the CAG's access to housing associations are clearly nonsense. He is unable to verify independently whether significant problems exist elsewhere in the sector. When it was under local government control, that sector had a serious fraud problem, with the misuse of public funds. The indications are that we should still be careful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pausing to consider my right hon. Friend's last remark. Would he agree that it is extraordinary, in light of this morning's exchanges, that when those houses were under local government control they would have been subject to audit by the Audit Commission, but that upon transfer to the ultimate control of the Housing Corporation a disanalogy mysteriously arises and the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have the same access?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, my hon. Friend is right. A secondary argument can be marshalled, to which I shall return, which is that the previous Audit Commission's involvement and now the proposed Comptroller and Auditor General's involvement are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
not necessary because of the operation of private sector auditors. I shall illustrate in a few moments why that arrangement constitutes weak control of a major sector of public expenditure—£1 billion a year—not to mention the massive asset base that was already mostly provided by the taxpayer.<br><br>
I was about to say that the lack of statutory access rights impedes the Comptroller and Auditor General's ability to follow up serious problems raised by whistleblowers or to respond to Members of Parliament who have concerns about the use of public funds in their constituencies. The Government have signified the importance that they attach to openness; they have promoted legislation to protect whistleblowers from unfairness—legislation that I fully support. That legislation names the Comptroller and Auditor General as a person to whom whistleblowers may disclose information and remain protected; yet he does not have the power to examine allegations made against private sector contractors who are accused of misappropriating public funds.<br><br>
That is another case of fragmented rather than joined-up government.<br><br>
A relatively high proportion of whistleblowers and Members contacting the Comptroller and Auditor General do so in connection with contractors' abuse of public funds. Contractors' lack of a statutory right of access limits the extent to which the Comptroller and Auditor General can follow up whistleblowers' allegations and hon. Members' concerns.<br><br>
For example, a Member of Parliament wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General asking him to investigate an allegation that LINK, a north Derbyshire tertiary college contractor, had misused public money. The Comptroller and Auditor General had a statutory right of access to information held by the college and the Further Education Funding Council inspectorate, but not to that held by the contractor. The college's contract with LINK had not adequately provided for the Comptroller and Auditor General's access.<br><br>
Similarly, when allegations of impropriety were made against Hundhill, a contractor of the then Overseas Development Administration, it became evident that the Comptroller and Auditor General had no rights of access to the contractor, and that any request for access could be refused.<br><br>
Such cases clearly demonstrate that negotiating access as an alternative to the independently guaranteed statutory rights leads to the justification of Parliament and it being denied the required assurance on public funds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What access does the Comptroller and Auditor General have to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Health, both of which are involved in selling off huge amounts of property? That is especially true of private finance initiatives in the national health service, in which old properties are passed for disposal to a central body in the Department of Health. On transport, there has been compulsory purchase of land as a result of potential road widenings, which has

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
then been sold off. There is little right of access to the management and accounting of those assets. Does that fall within the matters described by my right hon. Friend?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends on circumstances and who is selling. If a Department is selling, the sale and its management would normally fall within the Comptroller and Auditor General's rights. However, if an agency is conducting the sale, the matter depends on whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has been allocated rights. Once the matter passes to the private sector, he has no rights and must negotiate them, if he has them at all. As I shall explain, that does not always deliver a result.<br><br>
Current non-statutory arrangements mean that resources that could be better employed elsewhere are used up in the negotiation of such rights. There are also dangers that important contracts and grants will slip through the net. Without a general statutory right of access, there is no guarantee that the Comptroller and Auditory General can obtain access when he needs it.<br><br>
For example, the private contractor running the national lottery since 1993 refused access to documents and information needed to check that public funds raised for the lottery were being properly handled and passed on to central Government. The contractor also refused to allow its auditors to pass information to the Comptroller and Auditor General who, as a result, was unable to express an opinion on whether sums recorded in the national distribution fund were correct. As I have said, an opportunity to remedy that arose and was taken as a result of the National Lottery Act 1998, but such opportunities are rare.<br><br>
Another telling example involves the contractor processing civil service pay. The Comptroller and Auditor General needs access to the site and records of the contractor in order to audit £4 billion-worth of transactions relating to 150 accounts. Without a general statutory right of access, the Comptroller and Auditor General had to draw up an agreement with the privatised company to ensure that he retained the powers of access that he needed. However, subsequent changes to how privatised operations are undertaken led the new owners to suggest that the Comptroller and Auditor General could not have access to information from their internal auditors or to the computer systems to enable him to assess the adequacy of controls of pay processing.<br><br>
Furthermore, no access has been provided for the Comptroller and Auditor General to the contractor responsible for the defence fixed radio telecommunications private finance initiative project, although the Department considered it necessary to secure access for its own staff.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
If we rely on Departments' administrative arrangements to secure access for the Comptroller and Auditor General, Departments themselves will decide what the Public Accounts Committee may easily scrutinise. Inevitably, access will be incomplete, either through oversight or, occasionally, by deliberate decision. How can such administrative procedures, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
preference to legislation, represent proper accountability to Parliament? Statutory access for the Comptroller and Auditor General to bodies undertaking activities on behalf of Departments brings administrative savings in negotiating access, certainty in avoiding accidental omissions, and assurance that Departments do not dictate the extent of scrutiny. What disadvantages can be so overwhelming that they offset all those benefits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend confirm my understanding of the implication of his remark? If, to take a hypothetical case, the entire activity of Departments were in future to be conducted by agencies or private sector bodies, the Comptroller and Auditor General might no longer be able statutorily to inspect any aspect of Government spending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That proposal is so theoretical that it passes even the possibility of the current Government's lurch to the right. The theoretical argument is correct, but I do not think that we shall be into that game for the foreseeable future. However, we are not dealing with small numbers. The numbers involved are large, although such circumstances do not apply at the moment.<br><br>
I turn now to the arguments that I have heard against providing the Comptroller and Auditor General with statutory powers. The first is that it would lead to duplication of work between auditors, because local public spending bodies, private contractors and other bodies in the independent and voluntary sectors that help to deliver departmental programmes are audited by private firms.<br><br>
The Comptroller and Auditor General would not repeat the audit work that such firms do to provide a true and fair view of the accounts. Private firms that audit such bodies do not audit to the standards of public audit. Unless contracted to do so, they do not examine whether funds provided to the body have been used properly or effectively. Their responsibility is to the bodies themselves, not to Parliament.<br><br>
Moreover, such auditors do not always appreciate the special nature of the audit required of public money. For example, in several recent reports, the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn to the Public Accounts Committee's attention failures in the handling of public money and the conduct of public business in the further education sectors. The most striking example was that of Halton college, where some £6.4 million claimed from the Further Education Funding Council could not be justified from college records. That position had developed over several years, despite the fact that the college's auditors had been required to certify their funding claims. That finding prompted the Further Education Funding Council to review the quality of work undertaken by private firms that audit colleges, and identified anxieties about the standard of audit in 11 out of 26 cases.<br><br>
In the case of Gwent tertiary college, with which the right hon. Member for Swansea, West is very familiar, the college was taken to the brink of collapse by incurring a deficit of £6.8 million and by significant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0437">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
weakness in controls of claims for European funding. The college auditors had repeatedly certified that all grants and income had been used for the purposes for which they were received, but they had not conducted a detailed testing of expenditure using primary records to support their audit opinion. Private sector auditors are weak, especially in relation to regularity and the use of money for the purpose for which it was given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I have understood correctly the implication of my right hon. Friend's statement. Is he saying that, in the case of a private sector body carrying out a particular aspect of its work on behalf of the Government, if the money were used in a way that was proper from the point of view of the shareholders, but improper from the point of view of public expenditure, and if there were no contractual commitment on the part of the company to use it for a particular purpose that forced the auditors so to certify, auditors of private sector companies might give a clean audit opinion when, in fact, there had been a gross abuse of public funds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is entirely right. I am deviating from my carefully prepared text, but the position could be worse than that referred to by my hon. Friend. As I said, effectively the employers are the auditors and they are the bodies concerned. They are not in essence reporting to someone outside the organisation in the way that they would with shareholders, for example. I wonder sometimes what mindset that creates for private sector auditors. The fact that we found 11 out of 26 cases in which the audit was weak implies that the operators were not receiving the standard of audit that the private sector operator might have received from those same firms. There are two problems, but the theoretical problem to which my hon. Friend referred is exactly correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not that because the inspection rights of the NAO are different from the audit rights of a private sector auditor? Given the inspection rights and the way in which NAO inspection occurs, auditors can report to the management body of the organisation concerned, then to Parliament and to the Public Accounts Committee. A private sector auditor that focuses only on the private sector accounts, reporting to the House and the shareholders, has no such remit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly right. A private sector auditor would have no such remit and little experience of such practices. The procedure would go down as normal statistical sampling procedure and would not necessarily chime precisely with the sorts of things that the public sector oversight would require. When I responded earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, I said that the direction of the Comptroller and Auditor General is important, because he makes it clear when making that direction precisely what he is seeking. When that is done, the private sector can do as good a job as anyone else, but it must be done and it is not done automatically at present.<br><br>
A second argument that has been advanced against a statutory right is that it would mean that each organisation that entered a relationship with central
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
Government, including, for example, the providers of paper clips and catering and stationery suppliers, would be subject to intervention by the Comptroller and Auditor General. That would be unnecessarily bureaucratic, invasive and inhibit the involvement of the private sector in the delivery of public services, but a statutory power of access should be based on the principle that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have at least as much access—no more than necessary, but as least as much access—as the Government reserve to themselves in paying out funds. That is the test.<br><br>
The Government rightly secure access to bodies to which they have delegated service delivery, so that they can monitor the services for which they remain accountable. They do not reserve such powers for the paper clips, catering and stationery suppliers. They reserve them, for example, for private contractors that are managing prisons, processing civil service pay or delivering the new deal programme, which is absolutely right. The Comptroller and Auditor General has less guaranteed access than the Government in such cases, despite being Parliament's auditor. The new clause would provide for no more access than the Government have reserved to themselves in paying out funds.<br><br>
As I said earlier, the Audit Commission in England and Wales and the Accounts Commission in Scotland have rights of access that extend to contractors. Those rights have not brought local Government to a standstill or prevented innovative partnerships between the public and private sectors at local level. Indeed, from my observations, central Government can sometimes learn from local government and some of those innovative partnerships.<br><br>
In their White Paper, "Modernising Government", the Government recognised that audit can no longer be used as an excuse for not delivering more coordinated and efficient services. They called on public auditors to be critical of opportunities missed by sticking with the old ways and to support innovation and risk taking when it is well thought out.<br><br>
A statutory right of access will ensure that the Committee is well positioned to examine new ways of delivering departmental programmes and provide advice and encouragement to management implementing innovative forms of central Government programme delivery. We have already done that on privatisation, the PFI and information technology, and we will continue to do so. However, our ability to do so depends on access.<br><br>
I should like to examine the arguments that I have heard against addressing such issues through the Bill. First, we have heard that this is not a Bill about audit, yet it repeals 16 of 17 sections covering audit from the 1866 and 1921 Acts, amending key sections covering the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and introducing new audit provisions covering the whole of Government accounts. Seven of the Bill's 26 clauses impact on the Comptroller and Auditor General's role. If the improvement that we wish were not appropriate, the Chairman would not have accepted their tabling. So, they were obviously in order.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0438">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
The second argument is that the Bill is intended only to transpose existing accounting arrangements into a resource space and is not therefore an appropriate vehicle for the improvements that the Committee seeks. The Treasury did not need this Bill to introduce resource accounting; it already had such power under the 1921 Act. Indeed, it has already exercised it in requiring Departments to produce dry-run accounts. Only a limited number of amendments would be required to produce resource estimates; three or four clauses might be enough. There are rather more than three or four clauses before us today. The Government argue about making speed on this Bill, and perhaps they would have found a three or four clause Bill much faster to deal with. The Bill does not confine itself to the introduction of resource accounts and budgeting. It covers new developments such as the whole of Government accounts and Partnerships UK, the real reason for the desired speed.<br><br>
The third argument is that the gaps in parliamentary scrutiny and accountability that we seek to address have no relationship to the Bill. I accept that the changes in the machinery of government and the resulting gaps in accountability have developed over several decades and that many developed under previous Administrations. The Bill adds to the process.<br><br>
Under clauses 15 and 17, we shall discuss the establishment of a new body, which will play the major role in developing the private finance initiative. The Comptroller and Auditor General will not have statutory access to this new body even though he has statutory access to the Treasury taskforce which currently takes on this role.<br><br>
In clauses 10 to 11, we shall address the fact that the Treasury has ignored the Comptroller and Auditor General's views of the powers that he needs to audit the whole of Government accounts. Opportunities for Parliament to consider and legislate on an issue of financial accountability are rare. There have been only two since the current accountability framework was established in 1866. That is two in one and a third centuries. As the PAC Chairman, I cannot look forward to the prospect of another such opportunity—not unless several things apply, none of which I would want to think of.<br><br>
The fourth argument that has been used is that these matters have been raised at a late stage and need longer consideration and further consultation. For three years, and with three Ministers, I have raised the matters in the annual debates on the work of the PAC, which the Financial Secretary attends. My predecessor as Chairman, the current Chairman of the Public Accounts Commission, raised issues repeatedly with Ministers, starting in 1994. National Audit Office officials have raised them with Treasury officials on numerous occasions going back several years.<br><br>
Several months ago, the NAO proposed an identical replacement clause to new clause 1 for what was then a potential Bill. Why did the Treasury not incorporate it in the Bill? Why did the Treasury not even respond to the NAO on this matter?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
The Government did not consult the Committee on the Bill's drafting. The Treasury told the Committee that it would have sight of the Bill before publication, but it did not provide the Bill. We have received a letter of apology blaming parliamentary draftsmen.<br><br>
The powers proposed in the new clause do not take away or duplicate the powers of existing auditors. There is no need for consultation. The Treasury says that we already have the access that the Comptroller and Auditor General needs through administrative arrangements, so it can hardly argue the need for extensive consultation or to consider the regulatory burden. In my view, all the arguments dissolve to the touch.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Rendel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman recall that the Comptroller and Auditor General's staff informed some of us that when they brought those matters to light with Treasury officials they were informed that it was impossible to do anything about them because legislation would be required. The Treasury was aware at the Bill's early stages that it had an opportunity to amend matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I was being hyper-courteous.<br><br>
I would like to explain how the new clause remedies the defects in the clause. Proposed subsection (1) provides for the powers of access in the clause to apply to Departments and other bodies for which the Comptroller and Auditor General is the statutory auditor, such as executive non-departmental public bodies, or when he is the auditor by agreement with a body or Department.<br><br>
Proposed subsection (2)(a)(i) provides
<br><blockquote><p>"a right of access at all reasonable times to all accounting records and other documents",</p></blockquote>
and proposed subsection (2)(b) entitles the Comptroller and Auditor General
<br><blockquote><p>"to require from any person holding or accountable for any such document any assistance, information or explanation which he reasonably requires."</p></blockquote>
That provides for the same powers of access to documents, assistance, information or explanations as the Audit Commission, the Accounts Commission and the Auditor General for Wales have in relation to the bodies that they audit.<br><br>
Proposed subsection (2)(a)(i) provides those powers in relation to departmental accounts. Proposed subsection (2)(a)(ii) adds that the powers are also provided in relation to
<br><blockquote><p>"any money originating in the Consolidated Fund".</p></blockquote>
The intention is to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine grants and payments made by Departments or their funding bodies that originate in the Consolidated Fund.<br><br>
Proposed subsection (2)(a)(iii) provides those powers in relation to money
<br><blockquote><p>"that would otherwise be payable into the Consolidated Fund",</p></blockquote>
to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General can assure Parliament that employers are properly administering the new tax credits with which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
Government plan to replace benefits. The tax credits are netted-off taxation receipts that would otherwise be paid into the Consolidated Fund.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend raised the interesting and important issue of the audit control over the working families tax credit and, for all we know, a string of other tax credit mechanisms. Will he confirm his understanding? If an employer acted as an ersatz benefits agency, and if its auditor certified from its and its shareholders' point of view that the money had been properly used, those auditors would have no responsibility to certify that the money had been given in the way in which the Government intended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding—I have not looked this up in detail, but I will check—is that there are no regulatory requirements on the normal private sector auditors. Perhaps the Minister will discuss that when she responds. Regularity is a major lacuna in anyone's private sector audit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue my right hon. Friend, but I think that the concern is central. Will he confirm whether, under those circumstances, the Public Accounts Committee would have the right to call private employers before it? If it suspected that there might be widespread irregularity, would it do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the theoretical answer is different from the real one. In practice, my Committee can call any people or papers. The fact is, however, that that applies to every employer in the country. I am not sure which unfortunate employer my hon. Friend would have me call, or for how many meetings I should pursue a matter—or precisely how we would pursue it. It should be remembered that the Public Accounts Committee maintains its non-partisan nature by focusing solely on facts and the established information that is provided by the National Audit Office. In the circumstances posed by my hon. Friend, that would not apply—theoretically, yes: in practice, never.<br><br>
Subsections (3), (6) and (7) of new clause 1 provide for the Comptroller and Auditor General to have the same powers of access over money originating in the Consolidated Fund as paying bodies have over receiving bodies. Subsection (6) defines paying bodies as
<br><blockquote><p>"any body which pays to a receiving body money originating in the Consolidated Fund"</p></blockquote>
Subsection (7) defines receiving bodies as
<br><blockquote><p>"any body which receives from a paying body money originating in the Consolidated Fund".</p></blockquote>
That formulation ensures that the Comptroller and Auditor General has access down the spending chain from Departments to national funding bodies, local funding bodies, or to contractors, to the same extent that those bodies have reserved access to the lower tier body. Although those provisions will allow access to the CAG, it will be no more or less access than the Government have.<br><br>
Subsection (4) will ensure that the powers do not extend to local government bodies. It would not be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
constitutionally appropriate for the auditor of Government Departments to have access to local government. The CAG works closely with the Audit Commission, which has responsibility for auditing local government, to ensure that he receives any information that he may need from local authorities in connection with his audit of Departments. That is how the proposals are supposed to work.<br><br>
Serious weaknesses in the Government's accountability to Parliament have resulted from changes in the machinery by which Government choose to deliver their spending programmes. The original intention of the legislation being amended by clause 9 was to provide effective parliamentary scrutiny of all departmental expenditure. Unamended, clause 9 will lock into our legislation the serious weaknesses in accountability that have developed over the years. New clause 1 would correct those weaknesses, properly modernise the scrutiny of Government expenditure and restore Parliament's rights. It would properly reflect the spirit and the intent of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 in a way that the Bill does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wanted a clear understanding of what Ministers intend by clause 9, so, as you would expect, Mr. Hood, I examined the explanatory notes. The notes state:
<br><blockquote><p>"This clause is intended to reproduce, in a modern form, the provisions of section 28 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 which is the current basis for the CAG's rights of access."</p></blockquote>
Section 28 of the 1866 Act states that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Comptroller and Auditor General shall have free access, at all convenient times, to the books of account and other documents relating to the accounts of such departments".</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. David Davis) has described how one construction of those words might suggest that the CAG had wider powers than those contained in clause 9.<br><br>
I next consulted the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary to discover the meaning of the word "modern". It is an important word, and it is used in the explanatory notes. The dictionary defines it as
<br><blockquote><p>"Characteristic of the present and recent times; not old-fashioned or obsolete; in current fashion."</p></blockquote>
That may be an adequate description of the new Labour Government, but it is at odds with the true meaning of the clause. The clause does not update the 1866 Act. That Act was sufficient for the CAG to audit Departments that were then extant, but the clause is not adequate to audit public bodies that now receive parliamentary grants and funds. Therefore, the explanatory notes cannot be accurate because the clause will not update anything according to any sensible understanding of the word.<br><br>
I take on board, for I have heard it many times, the observation of Ministers and Labour Members that the Bill will not create the anomalies by which the CAG cannot have a right of access to the national lottery, for example. Other examples have been cited in Committee at great length, so I shall not repeat them. The Government are not taking the opportunity to include in the Bill such rights of access, which are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
clearly needed. The Bill will not create the problem. That point is well taken, so the Economic Secretary need not remind us of that fact. However, the Bill will not remedy the problem. The concern is whether it will update the CAG's powers and duties for the 21st century.<br><br>
The structures that give rise to the anomalies that have been referred to exist partly because of the way in which activities have been contracted out through agencies and other bodies, but we have no problem with that. The previous Conservative Administration was at the forefront of ensuring that the effective delivery of departmental programmes was carried out through executive agencies and other public bodies. We have no problem with private companies being involved in the delivery of objectives through the private finance initiative, but the fact remains that swathes of public money go through bodies to which the CAG has no statutory right of access.<br><br>
Some of the figures bear repeating. Some £4 billion of pay transactions on behalf of central Government go through private sector contractors to which the CAG has no statutory right of access. Six prisons are run and managed on behalf of the Prison Service. More than £5 billion of public funds is spent providing training opportunities under the new deal initiative.<br><br>
We know from the excellent PAC report in December that the Treasury accepts that the CAG may need access to private sector contractors. We all agree about that. However, the guidance issued to Departments and funding bodies does not guarantee access when the CAG considers it to be necessary. I understand that it is assumed in the guidance that the use of contractors to provide services means that the audit of public spending can be undertaken using purchasers' records. I am told that the guidance gives examples of when Departments and funding bodies may consider the need to make exceptions to the general rule. I have not seen the guidance, which is why I should like the Economic Secretary to furnish us with the details, but I am told that it says that the CAG will be given access when exceptions are made to the general rule. Perhaps she can tell us about those exceptions.<br><br>
In evidence to the PAC last week, the Chief Secretary admitted that long and costly bureaucratic delays could occur because of the amount of civil servants' time involved in receiving and processing a request from the CAG to gain access to the private sector contractor under the PFI. The civil servant will have to ring up the private contractor. We should think about how much time is wasted by civil servants, who should be involved in proper departmental work, ensuring that public service delivery is satisfactorily carried out, but who are instead wasting time negotiating rights of access with the CAG. The evidence of the Chief Secretary to the Committee already amounts to an admission on that.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
If the clause is passed unamended, the PAC might receive a complaint about the use of civil servants' time—time spent not in carrying out their duties, but in haggling about process, procedure and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
administrative access, which is a waste of taxpayers' money. That money need not be wasted. A properly drafted clause which provided proper access rather than a bureaucratic mire would help to prevent wasting time and taxpayers' money.<br><br>
I wish to put more questions on the record. The first relates to the position of wholly owned Government companies, of which there are about 200, spending £200 million of parliamentary grant. I shall not rehearse the arguments over the students loan company, but I have some focused questions for the Economic Secretary, which emanate from the Chief Secretary's evidence to the Select Committee last week. They relate to the rights of audit that the CAG should, but does not, have. Companies law will have to change to provide full rights of access to the CAG.<br><br>
The Bill cannot achieve anything directly in respect of wholly owned Government companies, which is why the Chief Secretary referred to the importance of the Department of Trade and Industry's current review of companies legislation. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is reviewing companies legislation, so what representations has the Treasury made to him about gaining access for wholly owned Government companies? Will he amend companies legislation in the light of representations from the Treasury on rights of access to the CAG? What representations have been made so far? If none, what representations will the Economic Secretary make to the DTI as it carries out its important work of company law review? If she has made contact, what has been the reaction of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to her requests?<br><br>
The Chief Secretary said to the PAC last week that he would examine whether the status of access rights to the CAG for wholly owned Government companies could be changed. In the light of that undertaking, I would like an answer to my questions here and today. Our concerns about the seven-month delay in responding to the PAC's request must be addressed.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden made a powerful point in last week's hearings. If he and his colleagues had been told frankly that the Bill was limited and that it would be too difficult to update legislation in a short Bill, which merely formalised the status quo without providing any fuller rights of access to the CAG, my right hon. Friend said that he would have responded, "Okay, I will go to the Prime Minister to underline the constitutional importance and get him to change his mind." If necessary, he would have explained to Government business managers that the Bill should be longer and fuller.<br><br>
The fact that the Treasury did not respond until seven months after the request was made scuppered any hope that my right hon. Friend and his senior colleagues had of making representations to No. 10. That was a serious hiccup. I do not for a second suggest that that happened by design—but for an accident, it was a big one. Although I do not sit on the PAC, I have great sympathy for the way in which it feels it has been let down in that regard. The powerful point of my right hon. Friend that the issue was so serious and the Bill so seriously flawed that had he had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0441">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 189</span>
time he would have gone to No. 10 to explain the position seems pretty unanswerable, although I would like to hear the Economic Secretary's views on the matter.<br><br>
To turn briefly to the question of whistleblowers, as alluded to in some detail by my right hon. Friend, while we all welcome the legislation in that regard, there is no means by which whistleblowers can complain to the CAG if he is not involved in an audit of the finances of the company in which they work. I have not heard any Government explanation of how we can get round that, but I would like to do so.<br><br>
Does the Economic Secretary think it acceptable for the European Court of Auditors to have the right to examine the finer details of the way in which European Union funds are expended in this country, for instance in farms under the CAP, while the CAG does not have equivalent rights of access? Does she agree that the Bill is sad and defective in that it gives European Union bureaucrats rights of access to farmers in my constituency, for instance which an officer of Parliament, the CAG, does not enjoy?<br><br>
Finally, I would like to ask a couple of questions on risk transfer and risk assessment in the context of PFI and public-private partnership. Clearly, the British taxpayer has a great interest in ensuring that high-risk PFIs never get off the ground. The Bill asks us to entrust the Treasury, and only the Treasury, with the decision on whether a project gets off the ground,—assessing whether it incorporates an acceptable rather than excessive degree of risk. We have said many times in these proceedings that we cannot just leave it to the Executive or the Treasury to get it right. We need a belt and braces approach, which is what the office of the CAG offers—it is a backstop against mistakes that could legitimately be made by the Executive, whether through examining departmental accounts or through the risk assessments carried out under any PFI deal.<br><br>
Does the Economic Secretary think that proper risk assessment would be made if Government officials undertaking the work knew that the CAG could audit the assessment to ensure that it had been carried out satisfactorily? I would have thought that it would have been in the Government's interests to ensure that if a PFI project did not go too well, they could satisfy themselves, and therefore the public, that the risk assessment had been done properly. What could be better for a Department, if a PFI deal went pear-shaped, than to say, "Well, actually, it was not just the Treasury who did the risk assessment; the CAG also ordered it and thought the project posed an acceptable risk"?<br><br>
That could assist Government, rather than being a thorn in their side. It would allow them to defend and justify PFI decisions.<br><br>
The second point, which is related, is again something that should assist the Government. I refer to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that full risk transfer has indeed passed, as far as is humanly possible, to the private
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
sector contractor. What a powerful tool it would be to know that, further down the road, the CAG will be considering a particular deal. He has to satisfy himself that the private sector has taken as much risk as it should. That would be a tool for the Treasury in negotiating with some rather difficult PFI contractors. The Treasury could say, "Parliament must look at the matter further down the road. The CAG will have to look at it. This is not us being difficult; public money is at stake and you will have to take the full risk." That would be a valuable tool for Government in getting the best deal for the British public in PFI deals. I wonder what is the Economic Secretary's reasoning in denying the Treasury that powerful tool.<br><br>
I want to ask the Economic Secretary questions in a spirit of genuine and honest inquiry, following some of the assurances and sensible comments made by the Chief Secretary to my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden and distinguished Opposition Members. My right hon. Friend did not have time to flesh out in his evidence to the Public Accounts Committee last week exactly what he meant; but, by reconsidering the issues and speaking to the Department of Trade and Industry—that is what I infer from his comments about 100 per cent, owned Government companies—I think that we can now expect the Economic Secretary to give us full, frank and helpful answers to our questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to new clause 1 and to have my name associated with it as a member of the Public Accounts Committee. I wonder whether I can start off by making a point wearing my other hat as a Liberal Democrat member of the Committee. I should hate it to be thought that only members of Euro-sceptical parties could possibly be angry at the idea of greater powers being given to members of some European audit body rather than to those who audit Government and other accounts of behalf of Parliament in this country. It is absurd that that situation should be allowed to arise and I hope that the Government, whose views on Europe are, I hope, rather closer to my own than to those of some of the Eurosceptics in the Conservative party, will acknowledge that we are in some danger of that being used against the European ideal. I hope that the Government can scotch that argument quickly by demonstrating their intention to make sure that the powers of our auditors in this country are at least as great as—or greater than—the powers that are given to auditors at European level.<br><br>
I shall now throw off my Liberal Democrat hat and speak as a member of the Public Accounts Committee. We are getting to the heart of the argument, which is an important one. There is a clear argument about the importance of the powers of Parliament and the Comptroller and Auditor General, as compared with the powers of the Treasury and other civil servants. The Government and Labour Members now have to consider the fulcrum of that argument and must decide on which side to come down. There have been times in the past when Members of Parliament have been strong in their support of the powers of Parliament—perhaps going right back to the time of Gladstone,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0442">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
when the post or Comptroller and Auditor General was brought into being. At that time, Members of Parliament generally felt that it was important that the powers of Parliament should be upheld, if necessary against the powers of the Administration. There have been other times when that was perhaps not quite as true, and there have been examples of that in some of the actions taken by the previous Government. I must say to my colleagues on the Opposition Benches that arrangements for auditing some agencies were left not with the Comptroller and Auditor General, but in private hands. In those cases, as we are now seeing, the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General have been reduced, and that is why the new clause has been tabled.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
There have been times in Committee when the Minister has almost seemed to want to accept the general principle that, wherever Government or public money is being spent and whoever it is being spent by, that spending should be within the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit. I hope that the Minister will confirm that, without exception, the general principle should be that the Comptroller and Auditor General has access to and powers of audit over all Government spending, whoever it may be spent by.<br><br>
The Minister has also said that there need to be exceptions to such a rule. Without going into further discussion about it, does she now know of a particular example of where that is true or does she simply wish to leave the possibility of its being true open for a future date? We now have an opportunity to enshrine that general principle in a way that the original clause does not.<br><br>
There are two different aspects to consider: first, whether we can deal with the gaps that have arisen in the past. Obviously, it would be more sensible from the Government's point of view to close them by legislation rather than trying to deal with each gap one at a time, which seems to be what they may do if the gaps are not closed as a general principle. Secondly, we must consider the gaps that may occur in the future. Are the Government saying that they would rather not have a general principle enshrined in law, because they would rather deal with who will audit the agencies as each agency is set up.<br><br>
I suggest to the Minister that it would be far better to enshrine the general principle in the Bill and then, if at some future time—I challenge her to say whether she knows of any exceptions—the Government consider that a new agency that they are in the process of setting up has to be audited in some other way than by the Comptroller and Auditor General, or that access by him needs to be specifically restricted in some way, that would be the time to introduce such legislation and give Parliament a chance to argue the case.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, the Chairman of the PAC, made it clear that the Government have decided to give a general power to the district auditor to examine all local authority spending. As the Minister said, local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
government is very different from central Government. I do not deny that for a moment. However, one principle is true in both cases: the spending of public money is so important that it must be safeguarded by Parliament and by the Government, whether it happens in local government or in national Government. We are discussing the best way in which to bring about that safeguarding. Surely the best way in both cases must be to give full access to those who are charged by Parliament with carrying out the auditing of that public spending. It is for that reason that I believe that the new clause should be introduced into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden for his contributions to the debate. I appreciate the concerns of various members of the Committee and I will endeavour to answer a number of points that have been raised.<br><br>
Clause 9 requires Departments to provide the Comptroller and Auditor General with access to departmental documents and such explanations as he may need for the purpose of conducting his audit of any departmental accounts. I can confirm that the clause is intended to reproduce in a modern form section 28 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 which, together with section 9(2) of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921, forms the existing basis for the Comptroller and Auditor General's right of access to Departments for the purpose of audit. The clause is not meant to change substantively the statutory rights of access of the Comptroller and Auditor General to departmental papers and records. It is simply designed to update the language of earlier legislation by bringing relevant provisions together in a single place, and to put a clearer duty on Departments to respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General's needs.<br><br>
The 1866 Act gives the Comptroller and Auditor General a right of access to departmental records, but it does not say how that right would be enforced. The clause that we are discussing imposes a duty on Departments to provide access and so clarifies how access will be achieved. The Government have not proposed any substantive changes to the Comptroller and Auditor General's rights of access because we are not aware that any significant problems arise in practice from the current access arrangements. Indeed, I shall come on to the many points that the right hon. Gentleman made in that connection.<br><br>
We believe that, generally speaking, the Comptroller and Auditor General has the access that he requires to do his job. Where particular problems arise, we are happy to look at them. Perhaps at the same time as speaking to clause 9, I can speak to new clause 1 which has obviously been the subject of debate this afternoon. New clause 1 significantly enhances the statutory rights of access of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to have said that she is not aware of any problems with the Comptroller and Auditor General's access to Government accounts. Is not the person best positioned to decide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
that the Comptroller and Auditor General? Is she not aware that he himself is very concerned that he does not have the full access that he requires?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. I will come on to explain in what sense I am saying that. I understand the examples that have been given by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, but I shall explain why I hold the view that I have just expressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, the hon. Lady should be aware that I was careful. Unusually, I was working from a text for that speech. The reason was that I agreed pretty much the entire wording with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the NAO.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's points. In effect, new clause 1 would give the Comptroller and Auditor General—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall come back to that. If I dot around too much, it is difficult to ensure that I cover all the points that have been raised. In effect, new clause 1 gives the Comptroller and Auditor General the right to follow public money wherever it goes. Amendment No. 36 would delete the access clause—clause 9—which is contained in the Bill. The Government believe that such sweeping access powers are not necessary for the Comptroller and Auditor General to do his job effectively. We therefore believe that amendment No. 36 and new clause 1 should be rejected.<br><br>
The new clause would give the Comptroller and Auditor General virtually unlimited access to anyone receiving Government money. I appreciate that that is the intention of the clause. It would enable the NAO to follow money through a chain of grants, even if the final recipient is very remote from Government, or to anyone who is allowed to keep money that would otherwise go to Government.<br><br>
Although the Comptroller and Auditor General would not have access to bodies audited by the Audit Commission, under this provision he would have access to bodies audited by the auditors general of the devolved Administrations, and to the devolved Administrations themselves. It cannot be right to impose that additional layer of audit, but that is only part of the argument; it is not the main substance of it.<br><br>
It has been argued that we need new access rights because the way in which public services are now delivered is different from the way in which they were delivered in 1866, in particular because there is a bigger variety of service deliverers now. Obviously, I cannot and do not dispute that, but any reduction in scrutiny resulting from those developments does not arise from the Bill. The Bill does not reduce access powers. It relates to a different issue—the introduction of resource accounting.<br><br>
With regard to the point that was made about access in 1866, things were very different in those days. I am not sure, Mr. Hood, that you have been present for all the book reviews that have graced the Committee's proceedings, but there have been several. I do not propose to review a book at length,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
but I could not resist making a brief contribution. My chosen volume, for obvious reasons, is the finance accounts of the United Kingdom for the year ending 31 March 1866.<br><br>
I notice from page 9 of that wonderful volume that total expenditure amounted to some £66,474,356 13s 3d—we got things down to a fine art in those days. The cost of completing the clock tower and works in New Palace Yard and its approaches in 1866–67 was £21,420 precisely—no shillings and no old pence. Finally—before I test your patience too far, Mr. Hood—the commissions for the suppression of the slave trade for supplies voted for the year 1865–66 were £10,650.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that my predecessor, William Wilberforce, was so successful in acquiring funds from the Treasury. I suspect that the point that the Minister will go on to make is that government has grown since that time, but so has democracy. The rights of Parliament should grow at least in line with government, if not more so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true. The right hon. Gentleman points out, as I was about to do, that things are now very different. The equivalent of £66 million at today's prices is roughly in the order of £5 billion, although one can argue about how the figure is updated. That is compared with today's public expenditure total of some £350 billion. Obviously, things took place in a very different arena in those days.<br><br>
The argument could be used to cut the other way, but—apart from the fact that I wanted to introduce a book that I loved in response to all the book reviews that I have had to listen to—it highlights the fact that we face very different questions from those that were faced in Gladstone's time. We do not know what the response would have been, had the circumstances of 1866 been replicated today, and how matters would have worked out in terms of following money wherever it went.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to keep interrupting the hon. Lady, but she raises a significant point which was considered. The right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon), my predecessor as Chairman of the PAC, told me that the National Audit Act 1983, in which he was involved, was not drawn more widely because it was the last Bill to be enacted before the 1983 election. Therefore, there was not time to deal with such matters, which were just beginning to emerge. The Bill had to be processed as a last-minute arrangement. However, the matter was considered and would have been tackled, had there been time.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's remarks are interesting. I do not want to be too unkind, but such an opportunity arose when the National Audit Office made its initial response—published in January 1995—to the 1994 Green Paper on resource accounting and budgeting. I have searched that document thoroughly to see whether matters of access appear in word or substance, but I did not discover representations on resource accounting and budgeting being made at that time.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is on a par with the Minister's representation of responses to the <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> as consultations on the Bill.<br><br>
Resource accounting was not necessarily considered the vehicle for rectifying the matter. Indeed, the Bill is the vehicle, as it deals with many audit issues. In 1994, 1995 and 1996—I cannot speak for 1997, as I am not sure that there was a PAC debate then—the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne raised the matter of access time and again. The proper route is for the chairman of the PAC—rather than Parliament's officer—to raise such a matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may be right. The issues have long been on the agenda, but have not always been married in the form proposed in the new clause, which will introduce them via resource accounting and budgeting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify her main response? Is the right of access into potentially entirely private-sector operations involved further down the chain following public funds? Is the objection that that may be deemed to challenge existing contracts, or does it relate to double auditing? The two matters are separate. Should the issue be one of double auditing, one may reasonably rely on the common sense of the Comptroller and Auditor General not to audit a matter which has already been audited by appropriate Government auditing or the private sector. Double auditing, therefore, cannot be the problem. However, the right of access is a significant issue. What is the Government's key argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both are relevant. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden spoke about statutory rights of access. We must make a distinction between access and whether it is statutorily underpinned. We are not aware of problems with access overall, and I shall address individual cases in a moment. I am happy to discuss statutory underpinning, but the Bill should not provide a vehicle for that, as it deals with wider matters.<br><br>
We are not saying that, in every case, the National Audit Office can audit Departments satisfactorily on the basis of their records. Audit, as opposed to access, is another distinction to bear in mind: some contributions elided the two.<br><br>
Access to information held by others can be secured by administrative means. For example, Government guidance provides that contracts with suppliers should include provisions that allow NAO access to the books and records of a contractor when it is necessary for the audit of the Department involved. The guidance is contained in document No. 59D, which is entitled "Documentation: Model Conditions of Contract" and was issued by the Treasury's central unit on procurement in 1997. One hon. Member asked about that requirement. The document emphasises that condition 27.3
<br><blockquote><p>"is important in all substantial Government contracts for Services. It requires the Contractor to retain records of the Services and payments, and to assist in giving information for the audit of the Authority by its internal auditors and the National Audit Office."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
The document makes it clear that, where appropriate, provision for NAO access should be included in contracts. It also gives examples of circumstances in which NAO access should be allowed, such as when the contractor processes or handles records relating to the operational activities of the Department, manages publicly owned assets or has some discretion over the disbursement of public money under a scheme laid down by the Department.<br><br>
Some hon. Members are keen for the NAO to have access to the books and records of private finance contractors, in particular. As the NAO has already reported on several PFI schemes, I do not believe that a problem of access has been encountered in practice. Last July, the Treasury issued guidance on the standardisation of PFI contracts that makes it clear that contract clauses should be included in PFI contracts to allow appropriate NAO access. Ultimately, we are dealing with a practical issue. We all want to ensure that the NAO has access.<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee has identified several cases, some of which the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden described, in which it claims to have found gaps and anomalies in statutory rights of access. It mentions training and enterprise councils, registered social landlords, the Chessington Computer Centre, privately run and managed prisons and contractors involved in the new deal initiative. I shall discuss some of those cases, because it is important that hon. Members appreciate the Government's position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Economic Secretary, who is generous in giving way.<br><br>
According to the PAC report in December, guidance has been issued that
<br><blockquote><p>"sets out examples of when departments and funding bodies may consider the need to make exceptions to this general rule",</p></blockquote>
referring to the general rule of access. The Economic Secretary may argue that in practice access can be secured for the Comptroller and Auditor General, which I am sure is true in many cases. However, what are the exceptions in the guidance to which the PAC refers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to answer that question in a moment.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden asked several detailed questions. Registered social landlords—housing associations—appoint their own auditors, about 30 per cent, of which are Companies Act companies, the remainder being mainly Industrial and Provident Societies Act societies, although some trusts are involved. The Department allows NAO access to registered social landlords by agreement. It is not aware of any major dispute over access.<br><br>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) in his intervention, in a number of cases, the Treasury and the Government have not been approached by the National Audit Office to try to resolve problems of access, although obviously it is a route open to the NAO if it experiences difficulties. We have not been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0445">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
approached to address issues over which difficulties have arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is much more easily dealt with because I raised such matters, and specifically the issue of registered social landlords and housing associations, not only in this year's but in last year's PAC debate. I did so tentatively because one of my concerns was that the very housing, association that appeared to resist in negotiation was the one that apparently will end up in the criminal courts. I will not name it here, for obvious reasons. That applies to the LINK and Hundhill cases, which will also end in court, if they have not already done so. I am concerned that the Minister has not picked that up, because it was raised systematically in our most important debate of the year and, in this instance, in detail by me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may not have made myself clear. My point was that the NAO had not raised with Treasury officials, issue by issue, any practical difficulties over access, from whatever matters they arose. I appreciate that the PAC and the right hon. Gentleman have raised the question across the piece, as it were.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that they have done that too. However, the point is that a first port of call for the Comptroller and Auditor General and the NAO if they experienced difficulties with access would be the Treasury which, after all, is the custodian of the manual and guidance for Departments on how things should be done to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General has access for raising issues of difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary said that her officials have told her that they have never heard from the NAO about such difficulties. That goes contrary to the advice that I believe we were given in the PAC by the CAG's staff. If, before Report, if not earlier, it can be shown that what the hon. Lady says she was told by Treasury officials was incorrect, and it can be shown that the CAG's staff have approached the Treasury, will she confirm that she will do something about it by tabling a new clause such as new clause 1 to overcome the difficulty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that I will do something. The question is, what should I do? It is probably unlikely that my response will be the one that the hon. Gentleman invited me to make, but I assure him that I would want to do something about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Economic Secretary realise how extraordinary this chain of argument appears? I have sat as quiet as a lamb, listening, but how extraordinary all this will seem to people in another place. The hon. Lady said that she and her Department are unaware of any problem in circumstances where the Chairman of the PAC has told her in detail that he has raised such problems, and, when asked whether she would change her view if her argument fell because it transpired that the particularity to which she referred—contact with one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 198</span>
set of officials by another—turned out to be fallacious, she said that she would not. Is not that extraordinary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not believe so. It is important that what I am saying be clearly understood. If a difficulty has occurred with the practical issue of gaining access, the National Audit Office has never felt the need to raise that question with the Treasury. The issue has been raised by the Public Accounts Committee and the NAO as a general issue across the piece, but in going through the individual circumstances the Treasury has not normally been involved by the NAO in any of the issues.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee made representations in its 20th report on the question of the NAO having access to Camelot, as the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden mentioned. That is why the National Lottery Act 1998 contains provisions enabling the NAO to inspect Camelot's books for the purpose of scrutinising payments to the national lottery distribution fund. It was the job of the Office of the National Lottery to ensure that Camelot passed on the right sum of money to the national lottery distribution fund, and that it had the appropriate rights of access. Those are specific and unusual circumstances, because there is by no means always a regulator involved in such situations, and the NAO access was not originally required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, there is a problem. As the Minister said, Oflot has considerable access. The CAG frequently reviews the performance of the regulators, and that regulator was found to be failing, yet the right to decide whether the information should be handed on or not rested with that regulator. That point comes up repeatedly. When someone in the private sector is involved in the misuse of public funds, whom must we approach? That contractor. When someone in the public sector might have misused funds, whom must we approach to negotiate? That public sector body—in this case, Oflot.<br><br>
I also want to raise one slight inconsistency in the Minister's approach. She said that if there are difficulties, the first port of call should be the Treasury, but the Bill says that the first port of call should be the Department. That is why, in every case, the NAO has taken up the detailed point with the Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to hear those comments.<br><br>
I shall move on to the subject of the Chessington Computer Centre, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned with regard to access. The general access for the CAG to Chessington is provided for in a free-standing agreement between the two that was triggered by the sale. Although Cabinet Office legal advisers drafted the agreement, the CAG was a signatory and was fully consulted on its content. I believe that the CAG took legal advice at the time. We are not aware of any perceived shortcomings in the access rights agreed, but if there are any, I am sure that the NAO has some responsibility for the matter, because it was heavily involved.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0446">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 199</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the tenses that the Minister used about the Chessington Computer Centre are wrong. Chessington is in my constituency, and the computer centre has moved outside my constituency from its old site, which is now being built on for housing. Therefore, I think that she meant to say that Chessington Computer Centre "was" rather than "is".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it is still making payroll payments, and so far as I know it is still based in Chessington. I cannot help the hon. Gentleman any further on that. That problem is not really the subject of the debate.<br><br>
There are problems in all cases. I am sure that the hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden is right to say that, on his understanding, the NAO has gone to the Departments concerned. However, on an issue-by-issue basis, nothing has been raised with the Treasury.<br><br>
The Treasury guidance on access to contractors states that Departments should consult the Treasury if a problem arises about NAO access. It is interesting to note that we have no record of being consulted on such a problem when it arose. I am aware of no incident in which the CAG has had to qualify his opinion of a Department's accounts because he has been denied access to information held outside the Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has remonstrated about confusing audit and access, but she has just done so by suggesting that the proper response to the absence of access is to qualify the accounts, which is not the same as the absence of audit rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is some truth in what the right hon. Gentleman says, although it was not a deliberate move on my part. I accept that they are separate points. None the less, the CAG has not thought it necessary to qualify accounts as the result of the access issue. Much has been said about such matters, and much more could be said, but I shall not continue at too great a length.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury told the PAC last week that arrangements for NAO access were a bit of a hotch-potch. We should like constructive dialogue on how we can address deficiencies when they genuinely exist. He said that changes could be made by administrative means, including amending the guidance on NAO access to contractors. We are prepared to consider those matters.<br><br>
If the Government were to allow NAO access by administrative means when appropriate, hon. Members may ask why we should not give the NAO unfettered statutory rights of access. [HON. MEMBERS: <i>"Exactly. Why not?"</i>] However, many other matters need to be considered carefully. There is a broad agenda and we must be satisfied that any change is required, that no costly duplication of effort, scrutiny or audit occurs and that no downsides arise for existing arrangements. We need to be satisfied about the affect of any change on service providers and business.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be far more sensible to include in the Bill the general principle that the NAO should have full access when required? If that were to cause duplication, those difficulties should then be overcome. That would at least ensure that we do not have to go through this process every time a new agency is created.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would very much appreciate being able to engage in a constructive dialogue on what the deficiencies are. I understand in principle why right hon. and hon. Members are pressing that point, but although I accept that there are broader issues of scrutiny, access and validation, the present or perceived loss of scrutiny does not arise from the Bill, nor do the Government or I believe that the Bill is the right vehicle to address it. Many wider issues must be dealt with before such matters are addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill is not the right vehicle, can the Economic Secretary tell us precisely what is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the right hon. Gentleman what is the right vehicle. If I could foresee the future in that way, I should do extremely well indeed.<br><br>
Hon. Members have underemphasised the impact of changes in audit on risk taking and innovation. There is a perception—opinions vary on whether it is a reality—that current scrutiny arrangements inhibit some risk taking in Departments. It is argued that the NAO is critical when Departments try to do anything new, which encourages officials to play safe. I know that the NAO has tried to adopt a positive approach to such issues and I welcome what has been said about the need for audit to support well thought through risk taking and innovation. I emphasise the words "well thought through".<br><br>
I am not sure that the perception to which I referred earlier has been dealt with satisfactorily. There are still questions about how much making Departments go through these hoops can inhibit the kind of developments that we would all want to see, provided that they were done in a reasonable manner. We would be very concerned if enhanced scrutiny simply led to embedding very traditional ways of doing things and closed down innovation and modernisation in Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although problems of access may not have penetrated the Treasury, it is accepted that there have been such problems. What is the objection to establishing a statutory right of access, which would solve all those problems, rather than going from Department to Treasury case by case? We have established that the issue is not duplication because that would be dealt with automatically. The impression comes across that there is some veiled agenda reason against establishing the legal principle of the right of access. If that is the case, could we know it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already gone through a number of issues on this. The valuable role that auditing and the NAO play in public life by looking at our public expenditure needs to be balanced against the dangers of closing down innovation and risk taking in an appropriate measure. That is one danger.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
Another area is the question of duplication of effort and whether we need changes in practice. The reason for doing anything statutorily is only to achieve something effective across the piece and we believe that there is no natural obstacle at the moment to doing that.<br><br>
There may have been some practical difficulties but we are concerned to address them. We will try to see what deficiencies there are in the current system and what steps can be taken administratively to rectify them and to ensure, for example, that rights to access are adequately reflected in the scrutiny arrangements. There also needs to be more consultation with other bodies. There are issues about the relationship with the national statistics commission and indeed with the Audit Commission too. There is a breadth of agenda to our current discussion, which means that there are some real issues here. We have had a good debate on them this afternoon but I do not believe that they cannot be dealt with satisfactorily in the Bill as it stands. I will oppose new clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to much of the debate. I particularly wanted to hear what the Minister was going to say. It is far from my intention to diminish the chances of the Government accepting the new clause. We have to distinguish between arguments in the sense of debating arguments, and reasons. I do not intend to go in detail through all the arguments that the Economic Secretary advanced, because, with the exception of one, they are arguments in the pejorative sense of the term. If she reads her remarks in <i>Hansard</i> when she has ceased to be Economic Secretary, she will see what I mean.<br><br>
It is an extraordinary state of affairs when the Minister comes to a Committee is and says that neither she nor her Department is aware of any problems, is then told that she has been alerted to those problems by the PAC, is then told that the National Audit Office has alerted the Department, and resorts to arguing that the Department should have told the Treasury, which implies that not telling the Treasury was bad, but does not imply that there were no problems. She ends by saying that that has never been her argument, because she would not change her mind if it were proved that she was wrong; indeed, she admits that she probably was wrong. That is an extraordinary state of affairs, which can have been brought about only because she was told to make that argument.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
At the end of the tissue of specific arguments, however, there was a genuine reason, which is what we have been searching for. That reason is the anti-risk or risk-averse culture, and I have real sympathy with that point of view. For a long time, NAO investigations into a series of policy moves—for example, privatisations—have been thorough, careful and proper, but they have tended to make people play safe. That is the natural response of Ministers, their Departments and companies involved in transactions—the same is true of the private finance initiative—if they fear that the end of the road will otherwise be exposure. Nobody is demoted or shoved
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
off to the Crown Estates Commissioners because of failure to take an opportunity that might have realised £5 billion for the taxpayer. That never comes to light. If £10 is wasted, however, and it comes to light in a NAO inquiry that is considered by the PAC, a career might end in such inglorious fashion. Risk taking is a real issue, and—I say this only in passing—it would be good if the Economic Secretary were to ditch all of the other rubbish.<br><br>
We must also recognise, however, that if what the Economic Secretary said about practice were anywhere near true, and the NAO has and will continue to have—and is helped by the Treasury to have—unfettered access, the effect on risk taking would be identical to that which would occur if the new clause were in statute. Therefore, we are not debating whether it should be in statute or not, but whether it should be in practice or not. If the Economic Secretary's argument about risk taking is right, it should not be in statute and it should not be in practice. If her argument is wrong—if it is outbalanced by other considerations—it should be in practice. Furthermore, if it should be in practice, it should be in statute. The Economic Secretary has said nothing to deny that logic; not a single word. That is because she is a perfectly intelligent being, and the logic is irrefutable.<br><br>
Is the gain—a real gain—that is to be obtained from excluding the NAO from certain transactions, Departments or agencies in the future, through the minimisation of risk-averse culture, greater or lesser than that to be obtained from ensuring regularity, which the NAO has the ability to demand? I beg the Economic Secretary to pay attention to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden said, and especially what he said in response to the precise questions that I asked in the course of his speech. I was trying to get my right hon. Friend to tell the Committee whether, as future Governments of various characters increasingly use the private sector, there was a serious risk, on a large scale, of irregularity not coming to light, not because of happenstance but for a characteristic, systemic reason. His answer was, I think, that there is such a risk. He referred to the working families tax credit, for example, which involves the administration of billions of pounds. Many other tax credits may follow, which I welcome—that is all right. There may be minor problems with the working families tax credit, but no political party finds the general principle of a tax credit objectionable. However, it involves a huge welter of companies administering vast amounts of public money on behalf of the state. If the auditors of those companies do not have regulatory obligations and if the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have a right of access, there could be not a problem but a major systemic scandal.<br><br>
We all agree that the scope of the private finance initiative and of the public-private partnership should be extended—I should welcome it unreservedly if £50 billion or £100 billion was spent through those mechanisms—but the demands that are placed on the auditors of the relevant companies may mean that they will not have to show regularity, unless, of course, a company member insists that the company should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0448">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
proceed in the proper way. If the Comptroller and Auditor General has not been allowed in, no one may be able to enforce the relevant decisions, and there may be not a problem but a Government-destroying scandal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest. Conservative Members have talked much about the burden that the WFTC in particular will place on small businesses. Is he advocating that the National Audit Office should have unfettered access to every company that operates the WFTC?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary is right to say that we have severe worries about the regulatory impact of the WFTC. In that regard, employers have not been remunerated for becoming agents of the state.<br><br>
On reflection, I do not believe that the Government want to adopt the remarkable argument that dipstick checks by the NAO at the behest of Parliament to establish whether a major scandal is occurring should be resisted. Tens of billions of pounds of taxpayers' money will be administered by private firms, many of which are small. Half the Economic Secretary's argument appeared to suggest the opposite case—that access was available. Perhaps she was inconsistent because she half knows that the risks that I have described are real. If we were in a rational world, we should be having the debate that I am seeking to foster. Is the real advantage of minimising the risk-averse culture greater or less than the real advantage of avoiding potentially enormous scandals? That is the real issue. I am glad that it has come to light, although I do not believe that finding an answer will be easy.<br><br>
There may be good reasons for not involving the NAO in various areas but in the end the risk of money being mis-spent on a huge scale under a Government who are ever more diverse in their methods of delivery is greater than the risk of generating a risk-averse culture among the vehicles of delivery. We favour pushing as far as possible the activity of Government into diverse delivery methods because, typically, the people who are involved in such delivery are less risk-averse than those in Whitehall—they are more efficient, more rapid in their decision making and less likely to follow the niceties of endless bureaucratic mechanisms. Were it not so, in general, such matters would be left to Whitehall.<br><br>
Opposition Members were concerned to involve the Comptroller and Auditor General in this context. If the Economic Secretary's argument has been correctly exposed, the Government want to keep him out of such areas. The matters about which we are most concerned are most likely to suffer from being insufficiently risk-averse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly tempted to respond to all the arguments about statistical checks, but I want to pick up the risk-averse argument. I know that it happens to be an obsession of the permanent secretary to the Treasury, so I think that it is worth making my view on it clear, because I have seen it from both
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
sides—as a Minister in the Cabinet Office and from where I am now.<br><br>
A senior civil servant who is responsible for a project that ends up perhaps losing hundreds of millions of pounds—a not implausible situation in terms of what we see—risks a difficult meeting with the Public Accounts Committee, and possibly a note on his record. In the private sector such a person would be unlikely still to be employed, given some of the errors that we have seen exposed by the National Audit Office. Therefore, the risk-averse issue seems to me to be greatly overstated. The secret of this was given to me by the second permanent secretary to the Cabinet Office when I was there; he is still a permanent secretary. He said, "You know, Minister, democracies are risk averse, because democracies focus on failure", as did the Government Members when they were in Opposition. That is the problem. All that we are seeing here is a narrow version of it used as an excuse by Treasury mandarins because they do not like the exposure that is given to their failures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very unusually, my right hon. Friend is being more uncharitable than I am. He slightly understates a real problem. I agree that the penalties of failure in our system, even where the failure is of a positive kind where a vast amount of public money is shown to have been wasted, are not so obvious. People do not disappear into the gulag—yet—although a prolonged stint in the Crown Estate's office may be compared by some to the gulag. But I accept that the penalties are moderate. Yet within the public sector as a whole and the Whitehall structures, because of the elegant and calm way in which business is conducted, people can often proceed smoothly up the hierarchy to the greatest distinctions, without ever having made a positive decision on behalf of the taxpayer or the state, while others may remain at a lowly level in an indifferent Department on account of having made one trivial error. Therefore, an endemic problem inside Whitehall, which no Minister or civil servant, however hard he tries, can avoid. That is true in every bureaucracy in the world that I have encountered.<br><br>
However, my point is that the matters about which my right hon. Friend is most concerned are precisely those that are outside the Whitehall net, where those observations least apply. If a private sector entity is building a mighty project under the PPP, it is likely to be risk prone; it is likely to contain the kind of people who cut corners. That is why they have been employed to do it. The reason why somebody was asked to mastermind the dome, with a huge bonus if they got there on time, was because everybody thought that, if it was given to a permanent secretary, the dome would be beautifully complete in 2003. Therefore, they gave it to someone who was a risk-taker and who got it up on time; they gave that person a financial incentive to take risks. This is splendid. I hate the dome, I wish it were blown up, but if we are to have the wretched thing, that was absolutely the right way to have conducted the affair. But surely the reverse of that coin is the necessity, in such cases, to insist above all on regular audit.<br><br>
I make this plea to the Economic Secretary: when she goes back and talks further about it, I hope that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0449">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
she will realise that the biggest single threat to the use that she and I want of PPP on a wide scale will be irregularity. The first time that there is a major, whopping scandal which, because of this short-sighted resistance to the new clause, the Comptroller and Auditor General has not had a chance to observe, her Government's project, supported by the Opposition, will fall like ninepins, because Ministers will find themselves under democratic pressure to withdraw from the process and push things back into Whitehall where it is safe and the Comptroller and Auditor General can get his hands on it.<br><br>
Therefore, the argument about being risk averse plays the other way. The biggest danger to allowing and extending risk-prone activity in government is resistance to the new clause. The biggest guarantee that we can move forward on a basis that will give the widest scope to risk-prone activity is to allow this new clause and assure ourselves that it will be "regular" risk-prone activity.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is doing an excellent job of demolishing the Minister's argument, but could not his logic be turned the other way round? If the Government believe that the clause should not be accepted because of risk, surely the NAO's jurisdiction over Departments should be taken away because it is in those very Departments that we want to encourage risk-taking cultures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. If the logic that was not really logic were applied, that would be the consequence. The sad factor is that, beyond the illogical logic, lies the new clause. What would it do? It would give the Departments, which we are told have the risk-averse character—and I agree—the ability to limit the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's interventions, not technically, but actually. The difference between my right hon. Friend's new clause and clause 9 lies exclusively in the difference between having a gatekeeper and not having a gatekeeper.<br><br>
The Minister has followed her illogical logic in one respect. She has made it more difficult for the Comptroller and Auditor General to get in, than my right hon. Friend's new clause would do—even in Whitehall, and that is wholly indefensible. I did not even bother to expose that deficiency because of the serious reasoning about risk-adverse activity, which is really about PPP and other methods of delivery outside Whitehall. I beg the Minister to attend to the points that I have raised because it is not in her interests or those of the Government to pursue that line. I am sure that she will reject the new clause, but I hope that, when it is returned to this House by the other place in this or some similar form, she will have had time to reflect on the matter and she will want to reverse her judgment. One of the things that will do most to promote her policies and those of the Government would be to have an assurance of the sort that the new clause would give and which clause 9 will not provide.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to bring the Minister and the Committee back to the politics of whether we extend the institutional jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is clear from comments that we have heard today and from what we have read in the transcript of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury's appearance before the Public Accounts Committee last week that there is cross-party agreement on the need for the NAO's jurisdiction to be widened. I am sure that Labour Members see the strength of that argument.<br><br>
Indeed, when giving evidence to the PAC, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury admitted that he felt the strength of the argument. We are in the strange situation in which all parties and Ministers seem to understand the issue and have much sympathy with it. That is quite bizarre. In my experience, albeit limited, it is not often that such a consensus is reached about an issue. It is odd therefore that the Government are resisting the new clause. I do not want to make partisan points, because cross-party consensus is something on which we can build and I hope that we can do so in future proceedings. The Government could take a partisan line if they wanted to make politics of a change and did not want to be accused of making a U-turn. I hope that Opposition Members will forgive me, but the Government could say that they are overturning former Conservative legislation.<br><br>
By extending the rights of the National Audit Office, the Government will be doing something that the former Government failed to do. They would gain many political brownie points for that. They would deserve a cheer from all sides. I am sure that Conservative Members would put their hands up and say, "Yes, we were guilty and the Government corrected our mistakes." I repeat that the Government deserve some political credit. Conservative Members might seek to provide excuses—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman generously says no. When the previous Government passed legislation to establish non-departmental public bodies, it may have been an omission or oversight that they failed to give statutory rights of access to the National Audit Office, but I suspect that it was done for ideological reasons that are not shared by the present Government. The previous Government failed to give jurisdiction to the NAO in those matters because they did not want to be seen by their own supporters as widening the public sector in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that the hon. Gentleman is advancing a high-falutin' defence of the previous Government's action that is fallacious. The deep, dark truth is that Conservative Ministers were subject to the same siren voices that are currently misleading the Minister and they made the same mistake as the Minister, failing to do what was right. We have learned from that, but we now need all three parties to learn simultaneously in order to achieve a change that would never be reversed thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right, but some Conservative Ministers were pleased with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0450">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
advice of the mandarins because it tuned in to their own ideological prejudices. The ability of Post Office Counters Ltd. to issue fishing licences is a good example. That major decision of public policy was settled by a meeting between the then President of the Board of Trade and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Many people in the Treasury did not want that extension of the public sector and argued that the administration of fishing licences should be left to private sector retail outlets. Some Conservative Ministers seriously believed that any extension of the public sector was ideologically bad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee would not profit from extended discourse on the issue, but the private sector is preferable and the previous Government did not make the mistake of assuming that the NAO was part of the public sector. They rightly took the view that Parliament was exempt from points about the public sector, but they made another mistake, listening to their mandarins, which is the same mistake as the Minister's. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's heroic defence of the ideological preconceptions of previous Ministers, but I fear that it is entirely false.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a mistake because he fails to realise that I am addressing not him in particular but Opposition Members in general.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point may be that if a sub-contracted prison receives the price for the job, how it is done is not the Government's business. I am sure that that is what the Treasury mandarins are saying, but that fails to address whether the service is being properly provided. Without an acceptable audit, we have only the word of those running the prison that it is discharging the service and that it contains a certain number of prisoners in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for trying to clarify the point, but I hope that he has understood that I am trying to be helpful to the Government, as the Minister acknowledged earlier in our proceedings. For the benefit of Government Members, I am suggesting that they could make political capital out of the matter, should they wish to do so. Opposition Members would not oppose them. I urge Government Members to consider the politics of that and examine the matter. Let us get some benefit instead of suffering attack the whole time.<br><br>
Secondly, we have learned tangentially why the Government have a problem accepting new clause 1 or something similar. They say that the matter is one of timing and consultation. The issues have many complex aspects. When the Chief Secretary to the Treasury gave his evidence to the PAC—from which the Minister appeared to be reading—he spoke about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
insuring against the costly duplication of effort, the importance of scrutiny in audit, guarding against downside effects on existing arrangements and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A substantial part of the Minister's comments was that the Government had only just been told; that the NAO never raised such matters, although its first port of call should have been the Treasury. I have to hand the minutes of the NAO Treasury liaison meeting of 27 May 1999 which may be of interest. They state that the Treasury was still awaiting legal advice following access to Oflot. However, the Treasury considered that, at best, the NAO would be given access to certain information only. Clearly, in at least one meeting before that of 27 May, access was raised as a detailed matter. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pay too much attention to arguments that the Treasury did not hear earlier about the detail of the problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the right hon. Gentleman that I do not want to give the Treasury power or credibility. I shall quote the Comptroller and Auditor General giving evidence to the PAC last week. Speaking about whether the NAO and the Treasury had discussed the issue and the chance for consultation, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We did put to the Treasury some time ago the access clause shown in clause nine as part of our discussions with the Treasury, so that has been available to the Department for a long time.</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman is right: the excuses about consultation that we have heard do not hold water.<br><br>
However, let us put that behind us and examine the current position. Could the Treasury undertake a consultation exercise now to examine issues of concern and extend access rights? It probably could, fast-tracking such a consultation so that it could take place before the Bill completed all its parliamentary stages. It would be in order for the Government to do that speedily.<br><br>
All the issues are known. Most of the bodies to be audited in future by the NAO understand the issues: the NAO does, as does the Treasury, I assume. Therefore, there is no reason why the consultation should be extended and drag on for months. It would, after all, have cross-party support. If the Minister chose—given comments by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, her Treasury colleagues are sympathetic—consultation could be rapid, so that a report to Parliament could be made before the Bill completes its parliamentary passage.<br><br>
It is not as if the Government has not rushed consultation in the past.</span></p>
