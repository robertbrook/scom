<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Government Resources and Accounts Bill</h1></div>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hood. Before we broke for lunch, we had some discussion about the supply process. The Minister was gracious enough to say that she would write to me to clarify some of the decisions that had led to the Bill that is before us. During the break, I looked at debates in various Committees on the subject. Thinking back to our discussion earlier, I became even more confused about what the Government were proposing. The Procedure Committee told the Government that it was concerned that Parliament would not be able to make the complex judgments required to express both the cash and resource implications if it decided to amend a request for resources vote, or a cash vote that came before it. Given that and the fact that the Government did not reply that Parliament would be given the assistance to make those complex calculations, can the Minister assure members of the Committee that she will write to us before Report stage to explain exactly how Members of Parliament, in voting for reductions of a cash vote or a request for resources vote, will be able to understand the implications of that for the corollary vote?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not sound like a point of order for the Chair. If the Minister is disposed to respond and be helpful, I will call her.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hood, for indulging me in wishing to respond partly to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Edward Davey) but also to discussions that took place at the end of the Committee and outside the Committee Room with the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin). I appreciate that it is a difficult subject and that people need to get to grips with it. We all want to do our best to ensure that everyone understands what the Bill entails, but it is important that people read the materials that are in the public domain on all of these matters.<br><br>
The parliamentary memorandum issued on 26 July is important reading. It contains examples of the way in which the resource accounting and the cash basis will be dealt with and includes samples of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food resource accounts done on those bases. It is important to understand that the cash feeds into the resource bases for the accounting. The resource base is ultimately the record that determines everything. It will be put before the House along with the cash, but the cash feeds into the resource and the resource is ultimately the governing account.<br><br>
The items that cause variation, which the hon. Member for West Dorset raised with me outside the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
Room, are the changes that might be seen on any balance sheet that cause variations in the cash flow such as numbers of debtors and creditors at the year end. There is no difference between the way in which this would work with a balance sheet and feed into the resource accounting and what would happen in many private sector companies. With respect, hon. Members might benefit from a more thorough reading of the background papers, which I appreciate are somewhat spread around. It would be helpful if we possessed a relevant sheet of paper, so that people knew where to go to read the various sources in the public domain. We could then all be clear in what we are talking about. I certainly am clear and view it as a relatively simple and straightforward matter. I hope that members of the Committee will find that helpful.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share a huge advantage over the Committee with you, Mr. Hood, because my paltry IQ has been raised by a haircut. Between us, we can try to cut through some of the difficulties. I shall not continue the fascinating discussion that has just taken place; we shall have time to return to it later. Having read some time ago and again during the recess the document to which the Economic Secretary referred, I am certain that my lack of eloquence has resulted in her failing to understand the problem of parliamentary accountability between parallel systems. As I said, we shall return to that later.<br><br>
The Treasury's discretion to lay down standards and definitions in clause 5(2) is a crucial aspect of the Bill. Before lunch, I promised to explain why it did not provide a sensible method, even from the Government's point of view, let alone that of Parliament or the electorate at large. I also said that I would explain the merit of the chain of Opposition amendments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
We must return to what is the purpose of Government accounts in the first place. Clearly, if Parliament and the electorate intended the Government to spend whatever they liked and to decide the extent to which they should inform people about their expenditure and accounting, there would be no need for the Bill or for its predecessors. We would have a one-line Bill, which would say, "The Treasury shall decide" the extent to which it had to account for its expenditure. That is not, of course, a realistic situation.<br><br>
We need Government accounts so that those who are not part of the Government—either in or outside Parliament—can ascertain how much is being spent on what. A set of figures organised generally in a rational spirit—clearly the intent of the <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> —is not, of itself, enough without a degree of transparency. In this context, those reading the accounts, who are often not experts and do not operate within the Government machine, must know exactly what every figure means. With sufficient diligence, they should be able to read back from the figures to the physical and tangible correlates—in other words, the actual outputs. That translation exercise anywhere in the world—it applies to UK Government accounts—depends on the clarity and fixity of definitions. There are no armies of people clever enough to take a set of figures and work back to the outcomes that they represent without a clear and relatively unchanging set of definitions.<br><br>
The first problem with clause 5(2) is that it offers no guarantee that there will be definitions, or that they will be announced or unchanging. In fact, it provides for the reverse of those propositions. It provides for the Treasury to direct, from time to time, that definitions be changed and whether to disclose them. In short, the Treasury shall be in charge of the question of definition.<br><br>
The Treasury, I am sure, thinks of Departments as dangerous enemies seeking to spend public money and of itself as a guardian angel coming to the electorate's rescue, protecting the taxpayer by seeking limits. The Treasury has always thought like that. Ministers and officials in treasuries everywhere think of themselves in such a light. Alas, I must reveal something that Ministers would see if they were not in their current posts. Indeed, they may see it fleetingly within their own beings.<br><br>
To the outside world, the Treasury is not a guardian angel or a protector of the electorate. Indeed, it is not the Treasury's constitutional position to be such things. The Treasury is part of the Government, so it is part of the problem, not its solution. The Treasury is the very body of which the accounts give an account. By extension, those accounts relate to every aspect of government. Parliament and, through its openness, the whole body politic, has an interest in pinning down the meaning of Government accounts. It is therefore no comfort to be told that the Treasury will decide all the definitions,<br><br>
If we are to have clarity and at least relative fixity to guarantee transparency, we must be confident that a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
body other than the Treasury, and independent of it and the Government, will be the guarantor of those definitions. That will assist ordinary people—both within and without Parliament—trying hard to understand the accounts.<br><br>
I may be wrong, but everything that I have said so far ought to be common ground. Certainly, as we shall hear in due course from right hon. and hon. Members and members of the PAC, the PAC made repeated calls in 1994–95, 1996–97 and 1998–99 for an independent body. It is unthinkable that there should not be an independent body defining standards in relation to the private sector. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton pointed out, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew our attention to that matter only yesterday.<br><br>
It is strange that a Bill should be introduced without a provision, which provides for an independent commission such as that advocated in amendment No. 3. It is so strange, that it is bound to be an oversight. The internal evolution of such matters in the Treasury and Government, perhaps dating back to the previous Administration—I am not making a party political point—must have led to the lacuna represented by the sad state of affairs in subsection (1).<br><br>
I therefore entertain a strong hope that, although our amendments may be rejected—they may be technically deficient—their general intent will be shared. Should the Minister give such a reassurance and persuade the Committee that the Government intend to move in that direction, we shall all seek the appropriate means of achieving that aim. However, if the Minister does not do that, she will be taking on not the Opposition or Opposition parties—actual and quasi—or even Opposition parties and the PAC, but Opposition parties, the PAC and almost every informed commentator who has commented on the matter or is likely to do so. There will be prolonged trench warfare over it and eventually the Treasury will give way, not necessarily in this Bill but in due course, because the proposition that we institute a new and entirely admirable principal regime for accounting and then say that the people being accounted for should settle the definitions according to which they are accounted is irrational and unsustainable.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
If I may, I shall make one further point before going onto the precise mechanics suggested in our amendments. There is nothing even in the proposed subsection (2)—although I admit that later proposals might be held to have the same intent—that limits changes of definition within a year. Within the scope of subsection (2), it is possible that the Treasury could direct the use of different definitions for different Departments and different definitions for the same Department in the same year. That is clearly a mistake in drafting. Even on the most extreme analysis, it cannot be the Treasury's intent to give itself such discretion.<br><br>
All that comes to our minds because no Government in recent history have been immune from definitional dexterity of a Macavity variety. The present Treasury has been the most accomplished
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
of all prestidigitation experts. A great deal of attention has been focused on the remarkable dexterity with which the Government have denned expenditure as negative income—a process which, if taken to extremes, could eliminate the entire Budget. There are therefore great reasons for our concern, in current and future imaginable circumstances—I do not imagine that any Government, even, I regret to say, a future Conservative Government, would be immune from such temptation—and for our wish for an independent commission.<br><br>
I should dwell a little on the detail of our amendments, which benefit also from the signatures of our Liberal Democrat colleagues. I will not be dogmatic about our precise articulation of the amendments, which may be susceptible to improvement or even radical change, but at least I hope to make a better job of explaining what I am on about than I seem to have done this morning in relation to cash and resources.<br><br>
Amendment No. 3, which suffers from one deficiency that the PAC amendments pointed out—it refers to "the Comptroller" rather than "the Comptroller and Auditor General", although we took that from the Bill—is simple: it would mandate the Treasury to establish a national accounts commission. We could not see a way of getting such a body established other than by giving the Government—in this case, the Treasury—power to do so, although there is precious little use in having an independent body established by the Treasury unless that body's remit is either self defining or denned by another party—hence the suggestion in our amendment that the Comptroller and Auditor General should determine the commission's duties. That is of some importance. It need not be the Comptroller and Auditor General who does it—in fact, it sits slightly oddly with his normal activities—but some body other than the Treasury ought to determine the exact role of the independent commission.<br><br>
The analogy is clear. If the Accounting Standards Board started falling down on the job, Ministers now present would be among the first to leap to the Dispatch Box and inform the House that they were taking steps to give the board new duties to ensure that it did the proper job for the private sector. We must therefore find an analogy, which is the Comptroller and Auditor General telling the independent commission what it should do about definitions of public accounting.<br><br>
We do not want to specify in overmuch detail the scope of the commission's activities because all these are matters of extreme detail, and most of the important points arise at the interstices of one detail and another. We have simply suggested that the duties should include applying the definitions of standards of national accounting practice to all departmental accounts and to the whole of Government accounts. The Comptroller and Auditor General may wish to impose other duties on the commission, either from time to time or at the start, but the commission should at least have the duty of defining standards, and those standards should apply not just to departmental
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
accounts but to whole of Government accounts. Departmental accounts are meaningless except in the context of the whole of Government accounts, and so the definition needs to be comprehensive.<br><br>
Amendment No. 4 relates to a point that I made earlier and to which we shall undoubtedly wish to return. It concerns liabilities. One of the present failings of the manual and the whole approach to resource accounting is that it does not properly capture the major liabilities of the state. Indeed, the definitions currently chosen would exclude countering the major liabilities of the state. It is a pretty extraordinary state of affairs when those things that the Government are mainly liable to pay in future years, such as pensions to basic state pensioners and other such liabilities, are specifically excluded. Clearly we need to make sure that a NAC has standards that clearly describe the overall liabilities of the state so that Parliament can each year understand and access the long-term implications of policy for the fiscal balance.<br><br>
Amendment No. 5 is consequential on amendment No. 3. It replaces the discretion of the Treasury with the discretion of the national, accounts commission. Amendment No. 6 takes us on a little pace simply by removing the reinforcement of the Treasury's discretion in subsection (3). Just before I move on, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to subsection (3) because it is very interestingly drafted. I can conclude only that it has been drafted without Ministers wholly attending to the words. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury shall exercise the power to issue directions under subsection (2) with a view to ensuring that resource accounts conform to generally accepted accounting practice subject to such adaptations as are necessary in the context of departmental accounts."</p></blockquote>
One must then ask to whom should they appear necessary, the answer is of course the Treasury. As a result, it could fairly be said that subsection (3) adds literally nothing to subsection (2) in which case, as we suggest in amendment No. 6, it should be left out. Even if the basic proposition we are advancing were rejected, there could not be a reason for having in legislation a subsection that can lead to litigation and a lack of clarity because it adds nothing to the preceding subsection.<br><br>
We then move to other amendments tabled by Liberal Democrats to which they will undoubtedly wish to speak. I hope that they will turn out to be part of a belt-and-braces approach, which would become unnecessary if the fully-edged approach in amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 were adopted.<br><br>
I have tried to imagine what the Economic Secretary might say in response. It may be helpful for me to outline the options. First, she may say that my interpretation is wrong and that, having given the matter deep consideration, Ministers have concluded that they do not like the idea of an independent body at all. If that is so, I fear that constructive dialogue on that matter and the Bill will fail, as there can be precious little discussion between a group advancing the proposition that it should be able to to monitor its own activity and another saying that someone else should do so. Indeed, the argument would move
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
outside the House to a wider political stage. Eventually, the Treasury would lose the argument, so I hope that the Minister will not take that option.<br><br>
Secondly, the general principle of an independent body that is not merely advisory may be acceptable. Our specific suggestion, however, may be rejected. Parliamentary procedures are ill adapted to such an outcome. We are passing from clause to clause, and our amendments would change clause 5. If our amendments are judged inadequate, but the principle is accepted, it will not be easy to solve the problem in Committee or before Report. It would be difficult to know how to argue for amendments later in the Bill unless we were aware of such an outcome.<br><br>
Under such circumstances, it would be constructive to allow for cross-party discussions outside Committee, in an attempt to sketch a broad outline that would command consensus, and in the hope that suitable amendments could be tabled later. If we did that, we would know the background against which we were operating in the remaining Committee proceedings. I hope that that solution will prevail.<br><br>
Thirdly, the Economic Secretary may tell us that the Financial Reporting Advisory Board is sufficiently independent. It is true that the FRAB is independent. Its independence is not especially concerning as, although its structure could be more independent, I would be prepared to accept it as a slightly inadequate substitute for a national accounts commission. However, I cannot speak for others who put their names to the amendment. The Economic Secretary would have to assure us that the FRAB would be given powers of definition and direction that are currently attributed to the Treasury. The FRAB's big disadvantage is not lack of independence, but lack of power. Doubtless, its independence could be strengthened over time. However, it will not achieve its objectives if it remains merely consultative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Government could substitute other bodies for the national accounts commission, such as the private sector Accounting Standards Board and subcommittees of other bodies? Has the hon. Gentleman considered those as an alternative and would he offer them to the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in many ways doing your job, Mr. Hood, because he is defending the Committee by moving me on from my tedious exposition of the third possibility to the fourth—and there is indeed a fourth possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the Government Whip will be very bored by the time that we reach the end of the Committee's proceedings. He could perhaps obtain some pleasant chaise longue to rest on while we continue our detailed deliberations. I am sure that Le Corbusier would oblige.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
A fourth possibility is that the Economic Secretary accepts the principle of independence and agrees that everyone needs power, but prefers an established body to a newly established body. That would also remove the inelegance of having the Comptroller and Auditor General determine the duties of the new commission. We would be content with the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, but there is a practical difficulty because of which we preferred a national accounts commission.<br><br>
The practical difficulty is straightforwardly exposed in annexe B to the Treasury note. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) about the speedy and panic-stricken way in which the document was rushed out. However, annexe B itself is neither over-hasty nor panic-stricken, but a considered document prepared by a knowledgeable person. It describes in great detail the major statements of standards of accounting practice and their applicability to national accounting. Page 3 helps us to see the scope of the problem, though it is not in itself overwhelming. It offers various pieces of guidance—in this instance, set by the Urgent Issues Taskforce—which are simply irrelevant to Government accounting as it is at present and is likely to continue to be. Employee share schemes or capital raising, for example, are irrelevant because the Government will not themselves raise capital.<br><br>
I do not disagree that there is a convergence between the public and private sectors—not just in accounting but in activities—as the Government increasingly use the private sector to conduct activities on their behalf. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) and others will debate later amendments that deal with public-private partnerships. I am sure that the convergence will continue and that in due course much of the guidance customarily given to the private sector will also apply in the public. Currently, large areas of private sector planning do not apply.<br><br>
More worryingly, some detailed elements of standard accounting practices in the private sector do not quite apply to the public sector. They are listed on pages 1 and 2 of the annexe, but I shall not bore the Committee by solemnly reading them out: the memorandum has been made available to everyone. My fear is that if we advanced the idea of private sector entities as the standard-setting entity, the natural response of the Minister and the Treasury would be: "You cannot do that, because these chaps and chapesses have in mind a whole set of criteria that are not relevant to national accounts."<br><br>
It might be easier and better to transpose people deeply versed in private sector accounting principles—and hence in the underlying principles of resource accounting—into a body with the specific remit of dealing with national accounts. It would be charged with the task of working out what was relevant, not of distorting the picture by over-zealous reference to private sector accounting. Having said that, the Accounting Standards Board or another set of bodies, including the national accounting standards bodies, could be charged with that task. If there were a will, it would be possible to persuade those bodies not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
to be over-zealous in reading across from the private sector to the public sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the force of the points that the hon. Gentleman makes. That is why we have not tabled amendments to replace the national accounts commission that he proposes with the Accounting Standards Board. However, the points that he makes can be questioned. First, the ASB could have a role. Its public sector not-for-profit committee has been used to consider such matters, so the minds of the ASB's members are not closed to the different circumstances that pertain to the public sector.<br><br>
Secondly, I was interested that paragraph 5.2 of the Treasury report, <i>Review of the Operation of the FRAB,</i> which was published in December 1998, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Two departments have suggested that the ASB should assume responsibility for the FRAB as a means of improving the FRAB's independence."</p></blockquote>
So some accounting officers in Whitehall view the ASB as the way forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman supplies some interesting information that strengthens his case.<br><br>
This is a somewhat surreal debate. We are having a rational debate on how to proceed without knowing whether the Economic Secretary is ready to join this golden triangle. Assuming that she will do so, it is worth saying that a structural reason for preferring a special body arises from what the hon. Gentleman says. In due course, we shall debate amendments proposed by members of the PAC that would rightly tend to enlarge the scope of action of the CAG compared with that of private auditors. It would be a slight oddity to do that while arguing that we should move in the opposite direction under the clause because some private sector bodies think about the public sector—the hon. Gentleman is right about that—and because large parts of quasi-government are audited in the private sector and, hence, are already subject to independent standards through the ASB.<br><br>
My argument is not overwhelming; a system could be devised in which the ASB set the standards and the CAG was the auditor. However, I can envisage tension. Those who want to resist the tendency for independence or those who want to resist the tendency to allow the CAG to be omniscient and have comprehensive control of the audit process in government and quasi-government might argue that one thing or the other should not happen. They might even say paradoxically that neither thing should happen by arguing the former first and the latter second.<br><br>
For all those reasons, it would be natural to take the first line of defence and argue for a national accounts commission. I hope that I have managed to bore the Economic Secretary sufficiently to persuade her that the Opposition do not insist on a certain mechanism. Any respectable proposal that guarantees independence and transparency in setting accounting standards will do. Any proposal that leaves the Treasury, or any other Department, with the ability to manipulate, to change, or to publish or not as it thinks fit the standards that alone, through their fixity and clarity, enable the uninformed commentator in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
Parliament or outside it to interpret the accounts will not do. It will not do for the purposes of democracy or for the Government, because in the end they will become just as muddled as the rest of us. I hope that the Minister will accept the principle and tell us by what majestic means she envisages translating it into practice, and we shall work with her to implement it in whichever way seems best.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) and I put our names to the hon. Gentleman's amendments because we agree with their thrust, but, like the hon. Gentleman, we are not wedded to every word; to the complete approach. If the Government showed flexibility, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, we would be more than happy to consider their proposals.<br><br>
I want to go the core of the debate, on which the hon. Member for West Dorset began his speech. The question that arises is which body should direct the accounting standards of the public sector. Should it be the Government, in the guise of the Treasury, or should there be an independent body outside the Government? The answer rides on the importance that we attach to accounting standards. Are they, for example, as important as the setting of interest rates, or the need for an independent approach to news broadcasting policy, which we and the Government agreed elsewhere should be set independently? Are the accounts of the state as important as those types of issue, or are they less important matters that could be entrusted to the Treasury, which would have ultimate control? Many other issues would be in order in the debate on the amendments. We could consider the experience of the FRAB and decide whether the lesson learnt from it suggests that such an approach could continue without a problem; that it would ensure proper and independent accounting standards that we could trust. We could consider the experience of other countries in setting their public sector accounting standards. We might even consider alternative models. I will suggest a third way that may interest the Minister. However we judge this question, we have to establish criteria for deciding why we think that accounting standards are important and what it is about them that might make us decide that an independent body should set them.<br><br>
First, it is important that public sector accounts are consistent across Departments and tiers of government. The lessons of the past few decades suggest that different parts of the public sector have widely differing sets of accounts and different standards and methods of accounting. It may be that we shall improve consistency through the <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> and the whole process, but if the control of account setting is left solely with the Treasury, there will be no dynamic to ensure greater consistency That is why I, like the hon. Member for West Dorset, believe that an independent national body that could be charged solely with that accounting purpose would be far more likely to create greater consistency than the Government's approach in subsection (2).<br><br>
The accounting standards setting process is extremely important for another reason. It must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
ensure that financial reports are transparent, and, therefore that the Government's accountability to Parliament is of the highest quality. That reflects somewhat on the consistency point. Getting accustomed to a similar framework and approach in all areas of accounting will make it easier for us to probe accounts to find out what has been going on. Seeing clearly where public money has gone and how the taxpayer's money has been spent will lead to improved accountability through Committee hearings and debates on the Floor of the House and will improve the quality of decision-making in Whitehall.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the dynamic of Whitehall's operation is tremendously important? If standards, such as depreciation rates, are being set by the Treasury, the matter is open to negotiation. A Secretary of State with clout in Cabinet may be able to get his depreciation rates adjusted to make him look a little better, de facto enabling him to spend a little more. Such negotiations turn Government attention from the substance of the matter to accounting detail, as they fulfil the agendas of certain Departments. However, if agendas are set externally, such negotiation becomes impossible. The relevant Secretary of State cannot go to an independent accounting standards body and ask for his depreciations rates to be altered so that he can spend a bit more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, the hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent point, which is extremely relevant to the one that I was making. He is right. If civil servants present Ministers with wheezes for getting their pet projects into the forthcoming financial year by messing round with accounting standards, the quality of decisions will be reduced and much ministerial and civil service time will be directed into unproductive activity and will not focus on what the policy should be and how much should be spent on what. The quality of decisions will be determined by accounting standards and the framework for accounting.<br><br>
Above all, the electorate must believe in the legitimacy of accounting standards. People must have faith in them. If people believe that the Government are changing standards from year to year when it suits them, their faith in democracy and how the Government go about their business will be undermined. That would strike at the heart of the relationship between the Government and the people. As Members of Parliament, we would not be able to put our hands on our hearts and say that the Government have accounted properly to us. That would undermine the role of this place.<br><br>
Accounting standards and the process which produces them are important as they go to the heart of what we are about. They are as important as the setting of interest rates, a free press or the BBC's independent charter. Earlier, I asked whether accounting standards should be set by the Treasury or an independent body such as the national accounts commission. I am beginning to think that we have the answer. The issue is of such importance that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
accounting standards must have external validation and be subject to external scrutiny.<br><br>
The Minister may argue that, in effect, the FRAB examines all the accounting standards proposed in resource accounting and budgeting. However, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said, the FRAB is advisory, as its name suggests. Therefore, its external validation will always fall short of what is needed to ensure that accounts are credible and have the required legitimacy. Indeed, Select Committees have argued for a much stronger independent role in standard setting. The Public Accounts Committee, in its report, "Resource Accounting and Budgeting in Government", which was published as House of Commons Paper 407 in May 1995, recommends:
<br><blockquote><p>"there should be an independent body to oversee and approve … accounting standards for central government, and we expect the Treasury to come forward with the proposals as to how this might be done",</p></blockquote>
That recommendation was made by an all-party Select Committee under the previous Government's jurisdiction. It suggests that the proposals that we are debating are party political. They occurred in the previous Parliament, and they had all-party support on the Public Accounts Committee. The Treasury and Civil Service Committee shared that view. In its report on simplified estimates and resource accounting in April 1995, it concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"The oversight and approval of accounting standards in central government should be conducted independently of Her Majesty's Treasury. The Treasury and the National Audit Office should come forward with proposals as to how that might be achieved."</p></blockquote>
The Economic Secretary might say that those recommendations gave birth to the FRAB—they came before it was set up—but it is clear from any reading of the Committees' recommendations in 1995 that it intended that such a body should be far more independent than the FRAB, and should direct and not merely advise.<br><br>
Earlier in the Committee, I talked about the parallel with the private sector, to which the hon. Member for West Dorset also referred. That parallel was also pointed out yesterday by the National Audit Office. That has been debated in Select Committees, and the Treasury has responded. One of its gurus, Professor Liekierman, described the parallel as inappropriate. He argued that accounting issues in the private sector are different to those in the public sector. We all agree on that. However, he argued that a body such as the ASB deals fundamentally with external accounts, not detailed internal management accounts. Although the ASB is beginning to set standards for management accounting, it does not regulate many aspects of management accounting.<br><br>
In the public sector, however, the <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> is deemed by the Treasury to cover wider aspects than merely external reporting. That is why the Treasury wants to direct everything—it considers internal and external accounting procedures together, and does not make the distinction. It does not separate the two as the private sector does, which is crucial in finding a way forward. If that is the Treasury's objection to our proposals, I hope that the Economic Secretary will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
reiterate it and clarify how the Government might be able to reconcile the internal accounts and requirements of every private sector company, and, no doubt, every Department, with the need for external accounts and reporting. Clearly, they are different things, which could be handled in different ways.<br><br>
It is possible to argue that I am making too much of this point. Private sector accounts, even internal accounts, are increasingly regulated by outside bodies. If so, the Government's argument falls. Therefore, they cannot defend their position by saying that the parallel does not relate; clearly, it does.<br><br>
If the Government reject the approach in the amendments, at least they should be prepared to consider an alternative approach to that in subsection (2). The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has proposed a third way. It argued that an independent body, such as a national accounts commission, could pronounce on what it believes constitutes proper accounting practices. Public bodies could be placed under a statutory duty to comply with such pronouncements, although the Treasury could still issue directions. That could blur the lines of responsibility and of accountability.<br><br>
That hybrid model might hold the answer, although I prefer the proposal involving the national accounts commission. It could be given the duty of pronouncing on accounting rules for external auditing purposes, which would ensure external accountability, although the Treasury would retain the right to issue directions relating to internal accounting matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is expounding an interesting line of thought, but does he really believe that internal accounting can be carried out in relation to government? In a company, the progression of company law and the concept of a company have established over a long period the idea that a company is an entity that is separate from its shareholders and customers. That allows for a meaningful separation between internal and external accounts. That distinction, which is used mainly by taxmen and shareholders, is tolerable because, with the exception of monopolies, companies gain their revenue by seeking to provide services to people who voluntarily accept the offered price. Governments get their revenue by the extraordinary means of putting people in prison if they do not supply it. Does not that difference lead to a difficulty in the idea of internal accounting for government? Is not every activity of government in a democracy properly the domain of public and parliamentary inquiry? Should not we resist—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask Committee members to listen to the hon. Member and not interrupt him with private conversations. This is the second time that I have had to remind hon. Members of that, and I hope that I shall not have to do so again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Should we not resist the idea of placing that distinction on the statute book? Should we not ensure, by whatever means, that there is a single, transparent control that governs the way in which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
Governments see themselves and the way in which they are seen by the external world?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument. I made it clear that we support his proposed option, which involves an independent body that is responsible for all aspects of accounting standards in the public sector. I have tried to answer the objections that the Treasury made in public hearings in this place to that proposal. The Economic Secretary might repeat the Treasury's objections when she responds to this debate. The Government could still accept my proposed model but not my preferred option.<br><br>
CIPFA is happy with the model that I have described. It is similar to the model that the New Zealand Government adopted in the Financial Reporting Act 1993. Earlier, I said that that had been amended several times, but the 1993 Act provides the framework within which the New Zealand Government have developed their resource accounting and budgeting proposals. They accept accounting standards that come from outside government. That Act is available on the internet, a few clicks away from the New Zealand Government's home page at www.govt.nz. That Act refers to the Accounting Standards Review Board, which is the equivalent of the national accounts commission. It establishes the functions of that board by suggesting that the board can issue rulings on best practice that have basis in law, and with which Government departments, public bodies and, indeed, private bodies—like the ASB, the board produces rules for the financial reporting of private companies—must comply. The New Zealand model, which seems robust and has produced very good results in the public sector, has made the hybrid work. The Ministry of Finance in Wellington retains some control for internal accounting purposes, but the Accounting Standards Review Board is also involved in setting accounts. Perhaps we can learn lessons from New Zealand and, indeed, the model proposed by CIPFA, and discover a way forward that will answer the Treasury's objections.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
In trying to find a way out for the Government, I do not want the Economic Secretary to doubt that we should look for the perfect option. The best process would involve the national accounts commission and a totally independent approach to accounts standards setting. In deciding whether the Treasury, the Government or an independent body should set accounting standards, we must establish the importance that we attach to accounting standards. What matters is not who is most able to set them or who has the best available information, but the importance of accounting standards to the democratic process. If we believe that those standards are fundamental to people's faith in the way in which the Government account for spending their money, the independent approach that the amendments would establish is the only one to take</span></p>

Dorset and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton have covered the relevant territory comprehensively.<br><br>
I am surprised that the Treasury does not regard adequate independent accounting standards and definitions as axiomatic when moving to a commercial resource accounting base. One cannot get up to tricks when accounting on a cash basis; only through the machinery of depreciation and other such methods can one get up to tricks and present distorting pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman just as he is getting going, but I hope that he is not suggesting that previous Governments and Departments have failed to find tricks when using the cash system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that, but, as we know, such tricks are less important and on a smaller scale.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset stressed the importance of credibility with citizens, but ultimately there is the issue of creditworthiness in respect of lenders to the Government. Were the Treasury to consult the Governor of the Bank of England, he would say that, if one wishes to preserve the prime creditworthiness of the United Kingdom and move to a resource accounting base, the markets must be satisfied that an adequately independent standard is being imposed on the Government in respect of the principles and definitions through which such accounting is conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend prompts me to realise something that we have yet to discuss, and which may not have entered into the mind of my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis). We should consider the direct implication for the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's activities.<br><br>
Some of the bodies that are currently audited by private sector auditors have to be audited according to absolutely settled and independently determined standards, because they are themselves money-raisers in the public and private sector markets. If the accounting standards that are employed in the public sector, against which the Comptroller and Auditor General must inevitably conduct his audits, are not transparent in the way in which I and my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs have been discussing, it is almost inevitable that those other bodies will continue to be subjected to audit by the private sector, according to private sector standards, so that they continue to be creditworthy. That would be unfortunate, because it would mean that the Government's determination not to have independently verified—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Member that when he is prompted to make an intervention, he should make his intervention prompt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall merely add that the situation that I described would be unfortunate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would indeed be unfortunate, and that is a secondary point of some importance. However, the primary point remains that the prime creditworthiness of any Government depends on the credibility of its figures. One can think of many countries in Europe that do not have prime creditworthiness because their accounts are not kept on a proper and reliable basis.<br><br>
My next point relates to liabilities, which my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset stressed in relation to pensions. Given that this country is increasingly moving towards the adoption of private finance initiative projects for the provision of public sector assets—on the basis that they will be provided more efficiently, on budget and on time—it is extremely important that there should be a clear, unchanged, independently determined basis as to how those PFI liabilities appear in the national balance sheet. It would represent a material ultimate exposure for the Government if there were a lack of clarity or of scope for changes to happen. Potential lenders to the Government, as well as citizens, will want to know precisely what the eventual liabilities are.<br><br>
It would be improper if accounts were not kept on an adequately independent basis. New Zealand's Accounting Standards Review Board may be satisfactory. We are not claiming absolute correctness for our model. However, the approach that is taken must lay down adequate independence of definitions and policies. That is axiomatic in any move to commercial-style resource accounting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Davis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Haltemprice and Howden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit to some ambivalence in respect of the amendments, and I am not sure how I will vote on them. That is partly because the Public Accounts Committee has not yet had an opportunity to opine on the issue. The PAC's report was produced very quickly, for reasons that I explained earlier, and we decided to focus on the practical issues that were before the Committee rather than the important and fundamental issues that the amendments address. In the past, however, the PAC has commented on the question of independence in accounting standards. When the Green Paper on resource accounting was first published, the Committee stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Although the Treasury will produce the resource accounting reference manual, the Green Paper does not spell out how accounting standards for central government would be determined. Both the C&AG and CIPFA point out that the responsibility for setting standards should not rest solely with the Treasury. As CIPFA highlight the power to set accounting standards for yourself is a luxury most company chairmen and finance directors would like to exercise, but for good reasons society thinks it inappropriate for the preparers of accounts to set then own rules for reporting."</p></blockquote>
That comment led to the creation of what is now known as the FRAB.<br><br>
The Committee went on to state:
<br><blockquote><p>"We continue to consider it to be important that there should be an independent body with the role of overseeing and approving the accounting standards used in resource accounts. We welcome the establishment of a Financial Reporting Advisory Body to the Treasury as a move in this direction. It is clearly important that the Treasury's drafting of the Resource Accounting Manual and the Board's consideration of it is completed in good time, so as not to impede departmental progress. We consider that the aim should be to ensure that Generally Accepted Accounting Practice is applied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
fully to resource accounting, unless there are exceptional reasons for not doing so which stem from the special character of government activities. We are pleased to note that the Treasury intend to review the remit of the Board and to consider whether the review and reporting arrangements provide for sufficient independence once the Board has completed its task of reviewing the Resource Accounting Manual."</p></blockquote>
That is the position now. There was an undertaking for the Treasury to review the status of the FRAB.<br><br>
What lessons can we learn from the private sector, whose accounting standards have had a turbulent time since the last war, with problems of creative accounting during the 1960s and 1970s? The conditions that led to creative accounting and its misuse in the private sector occurred after loss of confidence in an old-fashioned conventional system and the change to a new system. During the 1960s, conventional accounts did not reflect the real value of underlying assets in the balance sheets. Different styles and forms were used and that loosening of the rules and the introduction of judgment into accounting opened the door to creative accounting. We face the same situation with Government accounting today.<br><br>
The second condition under which the problems of creative accounting arise is an environment with a high level of financial innovation. That occurred in the private sector when city slickers took over companies for asset-stripping and so on and other financial innovations and tricks were introduced that were beyond the accounting capability of the time. The Government are now in a period of financial innovation in terms of the PFI, contracting-out and other aspects of the way in which we manage government today. All are broadly for the good of taxpayers and are part of the modernisation of government that the Government have undertaken and of which I wholly approve, but that modernisation carries its own risks. Our amendments are important—more important than they may appear to an outsider.<br><br>
I shall give an example. Eighteen months ago, I was in disagreement with the then Paymaster General over the Treasury's treatment of the PFI. It seemed that that treatment was nothing more or less than creative accounting. It was off-balance-sheet accounting for capital expenditure. The chairman of the FRAB took a similar view, as a result of which the Treasury has taken a different stance and there is a dispute over whether existing projects should be treated in the same way as future projects. That demonstrates the forces that are at play, the need for an independent accounting body and its effect when it operates properly.<br><br>
The FRAB has not done a bad job so far and I am not criticising it, but we must agree, on this one-off occasion and in a constitutional Bill, a structure and an arrangement that will apply not just to the present Government but to all Governments, who may appoint a less strong chairman of the FRAB. Much of our discussion concerns not the mechanics and whether the body is called the national accounts commission or something else, but the independence and power of the chairman and accounting body.<br><br>
I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset that I do not like the idea of the Comptroller
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
and Auditor General making the nomination because other mechanisms are available. The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by agreement between the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee—at the moment that is me—and the Prime Minister. He can be removed from office only by a vote in both Houses of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me say at once that if that proposition were acceptable to the Government, it would be wholly acceptable to the official Opposition. There is no reason why that mechanism should not work perfectly well. Indeed, it would in many ways be more elegant than ours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments.<br><br>
I do not like this inelegant mechanism, and I think that better ones could be found. I would wholly support the Minister if she were willing to look for such a mechanism. The question of the independence of decision making on these standards will return time and again. It will return in some of the later PAC amendments, in relation to the treatment of a true and fair view. This is an important issue. The amendments are not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, and I am therefore ambivalent as to how I would vote on them. I want to hear what the Minister has to say on this vital part of the future of resource accounting.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Formally. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would indeed be a pleasure. I have seldom heard so many people try to second-guess what I was going to say. I must advise the hon. Member for West Dorset that boring me is not the way to obtain the answer that he wants. Boring me is a very dangerous course of action.<br><br>
I accept the importance of the debate about independence and of the issue of independence in this context. It is the key point of the debate. However, the Government do not accept the need for the amendments. It is often tempting to think that we are here to discuss many things, but those amendments are the subjects that we need to address, as I am sure that you will remind us, Mr. Hood.<br><br>
The Government believe that the generally accepted accounting practice, modified only as necessary to take account of specific requirements departmental accounts, provides a robust and professional framework for determining departmental accounting policies. All accounting policy issues are subject to the oversight of the FRAB, which is made up largely of independent members, and which can report to Parliament. When the FRAB was set up in 1996, it had, for a period, a parliamentary representative. I think that the nomination for such representatives was exercised through the PAC. I am looking at the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden for confirmation on that. No such nomination has been exercised during the life of the present Parliament, but it could be if we chose to do so.<br><br>
The Treasury memorandum that members of the Committee have received sets out the accounting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
framework that has been put in place for resource accounts, in terms of the policies to be adopted, the independent oversight of those policies and the audit arrangements. The Treasury does not have unfettered discretion on accounting policies, as has been claimed. In fact, it could be circumscribed rather more than under the present cash-based system.<br><br>
Clause 5 obliges the Treasury to ensure that resource accounts conform to generally accepted accounting principles, subject to adaptations as necessary in the context of departmental accounts. Annexe B to the Treasury memorandum shows what adaptations have been made in the Resource Accounting Manual to accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board and its predecessor.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Dorset spent some time discussing annexe B, but for some reason did not wish to discuss any of the standards listed, nor indeed any of the proposed modifications in any detail. A number of them are not relevant for a variety of good reasons and some need some adaptation. I will give the hon. Gentleman just one example. There are no heritage assets in the private sector and no earnings per share. There is no point in those standards applying to resource accounting in the public sector. I am interested that he did not wish to go into detail on any of those because I have looked through them at some length and I find them a convincing test of modifications that are clearly only there to address the differences between the private and public sectors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making, in part, the point that I was making. There are differences. I was suggesting that that would be part of her argument for supposing that one cannot simply have a private sector body making these decisions about standards. I was not trying to avoid the fact that they are different; I was precisely attributing to her the argument based on the fact that there are differences. Why does she think that it would be impossible for an independent body to assure the standards based on SSAPs and other such guidance that should apply to the public sector? The fact that there are statements does not mean that there cannot be standards—or does it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There certainly are standards and they are basically the same as those set by the Accounting Standards Board, modified only for the purposes of ensuring that they apply relevantly to the public sector in the circumstances of government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has posed lots of questions and made lots of points. I can give way to him as often as he likes but he will never get an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Minister has just said, what reason would there be for not having an independent body that made annexe B a reality?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Annexe B has arisen out of the work of an independent body and I will come on to the question of independence. Independence is a matter of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
opinion in this context and I will come on to the proposals set out in the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can read the sentence many times and get this far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will indulge me just a little longer, I should like to dwell on the points made by the hon. Gentleman. The Minister rightly referred to annexe B and explained how the process of accounting standards setting prior to the publication of the <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> has resulted in the differences between private and public sector accounting. Before that, she said that the Treasury was somehow more circumscribed under this Bill, with respect to resource accounting, than it was under cash accounting. Will she explain how she comes to that conclusion, because my reading of subsection (3), particularly, the last phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to such adaptations as are necessary in the context of departmental accounts"</p></blockquote>
suggests that the Committee is being asked to allow any future Government—Labour, Liberal Democrat or Conservative—to publish their own revised annexe B with completely different conclusions. My reading is that the Government are not circumscribed in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister carries on with her speech, may I remind hon. Members that interventions should be brief?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. I shall come on to the suggestion about creative accounting in a moment. I shall return to the question of the adaptations and the fact that they are fully justified and that all proposals for the entries in the Treasury's <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> are subject to the scrutiny of the Financial Reporting Advisory Board, which provides a check on Treasury discretion. The FRAB prepares reports on its own activities, setting out its views on Treasury proposals. Those reports are submitted to Parliament, so that all hon. Members can understand how the process works. The Treasury manual requires resource accounts to give a true and fair view. It is against that benchmark that the Comptroller and Auditor General undertakes his independent audit, providing further scrutiny of the detailed accounting policies that Departments adopt. To obtain unqualified audit opinions, the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to be satisfied that the accounts meet the highest standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Economic Secretary again. I am grateful to her for giving way with great courtesy, but it is important that nothing factually inaccurate is said in Committee. I beg her to consider whether what she has said is factually accurate. The National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General have specifically informed us that he cannot inspect the standards used and that he must carry out audits against whatever standards are set for him. It would be improper to proceed without correcting that mistake.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that anything that I have said was wrong. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is a seeker after the truth and, of course, I should like him to find it and I am doing my best to provide him with it. I wish to revise nothing of what I have said in the light of his remarks.<br><br>
The proposal for a national accounts commission is flawed for several reasons, so the amendment cannot be accepted. First, the proposal ignores the framework that the Conservative party put in place when in government to limit the Treasury's discretion in setting accounting policies and the fact that it is working. The independent scrutiny of the FRAB, created in response to Select Committee recommendations and welcomed by the Committee, is of crucial importance.<br><br>
It is worthwhile remarking that the hon. Member for West Dorset rubbished the views expressed to the PAC about the independence of the FRAB as reported in the document about which he made much this morning. One of the three witnesses whose independence he rubbished was a senior representative of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office. If that office takes the view that the FRAB is a satisfactory and independent mechanism and has reported thus, it is wrong for the hon. Gentleman to suggest—perhaps unwittingly, because he might not have realised who the three witnesses were—that those were the views of three people whose opinions are not important in such matters. Those were important independent views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ensure that the Committee is not misled? Of course the Economic Secretary is right that one of those people was a member of the National Audit Office, although I think that the evidence was given to the Treasury Committee, not the PAC. However, it should not be said that the Comptroller and Auditor General thinks that the FRAB structure is appropriate in the long term. As I have said, the view is that the FRAB has done a good job, but the problem is that the structure is not immune from interference in the long run. I think that my views on that are the same as those of the CAG.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for contributing those details.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the record will show that I was casting aspersions not on the FRAB's independence but, first, on the fact that people had to ask whether it was independent, which is odd, and secondly and critically on the fact that, however independent it is, it lacks teeth—about which an exchange of views took place between the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the comments made by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden a few moments ago that the FRAB has exercised itself, raised points and brought about changes to proposals as a result of its work. I do not accept that it is a body without teeth. That is an unfair way of regarding it. The FRAB includes representatives of the Accounting Standards Board, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Audit Commission, an independent economist, a representative non-departmental public body, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
Government statistical service and several other representatives who are independent of Government, as well as an independent chairman. I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's point that the quality of the chairman on such bodies is important, but nothing can be guaranteed in every direction for ever. We want the right people; we have already secured the right person and we are happy with the working of the arrangements.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
Secondly, we do not believe that a separate standard-setting body is needed, not least if it implies a body that will be in competition with the Accounting Standards Board The Government are content to follow the standards issued or approved by the ASB, which already apply to all private and many public sector bodies. Introducing separate standards for Government accounts would do nothing but lead to confusion and to a divergence between the requirements placed on Departments and those placed on other bodies—precisely what resource accounting and budgeting are intended to prevent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is worried about the name of the body, but the hon. Member for West Dorset and I expressly mentioned that we would be more than happy for the Accounting Standards Board to have this remit. The hon. Lady's arguments were discussed before she addressed the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows full well that my problem is not with the name of the body.<br><br>
Thirdly, the suggestion that the Comptroller and Auditor General determine the duties of the commission would confer inappropriate powers which might threaten his independence. The Government's proposals give the Treasury little discretion in setting up accounting policies. That contrasts with the present system in which the Treasury has had almost total freedom to determine the policies to be followed.<br><br>
I wish to deal more specifically with amendment No. 3, which will enable me to deal with further points raised by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen. I would also like to make one more general point at this stage. Ministers do not want to criticise the work of parliamentary draftsmen, but they saw fit occasionally and unfortunately to abbreviate the title, Comptroller and Auditor General, to Comptroller. I want to make it clear that although we have not yet tabled amendments to rectify the problem, we shall be happy to do so later if necessary to ensure that the full reference is used throughout the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 3 implies the setting up of a new accounting standards-setting body in competition with the Accounting Standards Board. A separate standards-setting body or separate statements of national accounting practice are not needed. The Government are content to follow as far as possible the standards issued or approved by the Accounting Standards Board. As I have already said, they apply to many private and public sector bodies in various ways.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
The ASB acknowledges in its own foreword to "Accounting Standards" that the prescription of accounting requirements for the public sector in the UK is a matter for the Government. The Government have followed the UK's generally accepted accounting principles, modified, if necessary, to take account of the specific requirements of central Government accounts. That does not require the setting up of a separate standard-setting body, but does require the robust professional framework that already exists for determining accounting policies in central Government.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and other hon. Members asked whether we should accept the Accounting Standards Board as the standard setter. Resource accounting and planning will form part of the planning and control system for central Government and will have to reflect the noncommercial nature of Government activities, so it has been necessary to place two interpretations on GAAP—hence the need for the <i>Resource Accounting Manual.</i> Resource accounts will, subject to parliamentary approval, replace appropriation accounts, thus forming an integral part of resource accounting and budgeting, which place an additional requirement on resource accounts.<br><br>
It may be worth recalling the genesis of the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. As the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden said, the FRAB was set up in response to requests from the PAC and Treasury Committee and was welcomed by them in 1996. When it was set up, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which has been mentioned, noted that, potentially, it had the independence and status to make a significant contribution to the development of accounting standards in central Government in exactly the ways expounded by Opposition Members.<br><br>
We share such an objective. I accept entirely the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about accounting systems being seen to be credible, reliable and acceptable, and how important that is for the Government, and about the involvement of money from the UK economy, and elsewhere.<br><br>
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, who spoke about different accounting rules in the public sector and his trip across the oceans to New Zealand, courtesy of the internet. Of course, different requirements are appropriate in different circumstances. There have been considerable moves to achieve greater consistency in public accounts. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Accounting Standards Board's public sector not-for-profit committee, which has been instrumental in achieving greater consistency. The move to resource accounts, especially the introduction of the Government account, will greatly assist and strengthen that process.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out the difference between the Accounting Standards Board and Government accounts. Of course, the ASB does
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
not deal with internal management accounts, although Government accounts do, along with external accounts. That would be new territory for the ASB. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciated that fully.<br><br>
I turn to amendment No. 4. In response to the matter raised by the hon. Member for West Dorset, our proposals will ensure the proper disclosure of all departmental liabilities. The FRAB will result in Departments publishing for the first time balance sheets on which their assets and liabilities will be clearly set out. That is a major improvement on cash accounts and represents an important increase in accountability and transparency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the liabilities of the state for the basic state pension and to pay money in later years for PFI or PPP projects be accounted on the balance sheet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The resource accounts and whole of Government accounts will apply the financial reporting standard 12 in its entirety. That is the standard relating to liabilities, as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows. If, under the rule set out in FRS 12, a liability would fall to be included on the departmental balance sheet, it will be. There is nothing complicated or difficult about this. All liabilities will be assessed in accordance with that accounting standard and will be recognised in resource accounts and/or whole of Government accounts if they meet the criteria set out in standards. There is therefore no need to make any special provision.<br><br>
It may be worth pointing out that depreciation rates are not settled bilaterally between Ministers, or at least not now. I obviously cannot comment on what might have happened before. They certainly are not at present settled bilaterally, as I think that the hon. Gentleman suggested that they were. The principles on depreciation are set out in the appropriate ASB accounting standard, which again is part of the <i>Resource Accounting Manual.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to FRS 12. In the Treasury's own notes, FRS 12 refers us back to chapters 4.3 and 4.4 in the <i>Resource Accounting Manual.</i> It is impossible for a normal human being to understand the answer to my question from 4.3 and 4.4. Could she give us a simple and straightforward answer? Will the liabilities for the public sector for the basic state pension be included in the whole of Government balance sheet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that they will, but I would need to confirm that to be absolutely certain. I said that I would come back to wheezes and creative accounting and other matters that greatly concern Opposition Members. I hope that that is not because they have had any experience of them, which would shock me. The RAM is underpinned by detailed accounting standards and incorporates safeguards against creative accounting. Resource accounts have to be produced in accordance with it and will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Departments cannot change their accounting policy or their depreciation methods unless to do so would give a fairer presentation of the results.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
Departments are required to consult the Treasury in advance about the impact of any such changes on their budgetary control. Much as the hon. Gentleman argued his proposals at great length and possibly with great persuasiveness, he failed to persuade me.<br><br>
Finally I should just like to point out that this body was set up to have independence at its heart. It is subject to various forms of scrutiny and reporting to provide safeguards to Parliament and an appointment is made from Parliament on to the body concerned. It is governed basically by accounting standards set down by the ASB, adapting as necessary only to reflect the needs of the public sector. I therefore believe that we have a mechanism that guarantees the independence of the accounting standards framework, which I agree is the important basis needed to drive forward resource accounting and budgeting on a good basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I commiserate with my hon. Friend the Minister. A low tolerance of boredom leaves one singularly ill equipped for life in this establishment. A few evening classes on it might be quite useful, which I am sure that the Committee will help to provide. So many points that we shall discuss could have been disposed of, thus saving the Committee's time, if the commitment that the Bill would come to the Public Accounts Committee in draft form first had been fulfilled. If that had happened, there would have been no need for us to bore the Committee and the Minister with so much of the technicality. There is a serious issue here and it is possible that we have the wrong format for solving it.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
There are certain cardinal points that the House and the PAC consider almost immovable. One is that, whichever body exists, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission must automatically be members of it. This is not a matter of discretion. We could throw open the point raised by the Minister about a member of the PAC being on the Committee at some time. I had not thought of pressing for that, but it is something else to consider in the process that I shall suggest.<br><br>
My point to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary about the commission is that it is imperative that its independence be clear. When the PAC received the Treasury's response to its report to that Department, it stated:
"<br><blockquote><p>We continue to consider it to be important that there should be an independent body with the role of overseeing and approving the accounting standards used in resource accounts. We welcome the establishment of a Financial Reporting Advisory Board to the Treasury as a move in this direction."</p></blockquote>
That was not the achievement of that requirement but a move in this direction. The PAC also stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are pleased to note that the Treasury intend to review the remit of the Board and to consider whether the review and reporting arrangements provide for sufficient independence once the Board has completed … the <i>Resource Accounting Manual."</i></p></blockquote>
That was the Treasury's commitment to Parliament that there would be a review. We ask again for that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
At a tangent, I make the point that as regards the slight altercation at the start of the debate, it was suggested that the CAG had the option not to accept the standards laid down. That is not so. The CAG made it clear yesterday—I have corroborated this since the earlier difference of opinion—that he has to accept the established standards, whether or not he agrees with them. His involvement at the moment is that he has one vote on the FRAB. He does not set those standards, but he works to, and by, them.<br><br>
The next essential, which was touched on by the Chairman of the PAC in an intervention, is that any such organisation or body—be it a vamped-up FRAB or a new organisation—must report to the PAC and to Parliament. That also is imperative. We cannot have the Executive determining the shape and form of the body that sets the standards by which it will be reviewed.<br><br>
The next requirement is that the Chair must be appointed independently. I have no set idea about the method for that. Let me put this thought to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. I will continue speaking, if necessary, to allow her a little time to exchange notes, as all of us have had to do. If the hon. Member for West Dorset, who moved the amendment, agrees to withdraw it, will she, in fulfilment of a Treasury commitment to the PAC and to Parliament, carry out the promised review quickly and report the findings to the PAC before Report. The PAC could then make recommendations to my hon. Friend and the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I am tempted to call him my right hon. Friend. If the Economic Secretary were to accept that proposal, she would entirely meet my concerns on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not had a chance to discuss such matters because we did not originally intend to participate in their consideration. However, I emphasise that we are not interested in time-wasting. We want to get resource accounting up and working, not to delay it. However, the Treasury has given Parliament a commitment on behalf of the Government, and we want that commitment for a review after completion of the manual to be fulfilled. It would be practical for that review to be undertaken in the form that I suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Economic Secretary accepted that suggestion, I would wish to withdraw the amendment. If she were to do so, it would answer the point and enable the Government to propose a proper system in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to consider that. I have made all the points that I need to make and do not want to waste any time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The force of the right hon. Gentleman's argument is relevant. Although I may be mistaken, the Treasury has published such a review, and I quoted from it during my speech. It was entitled "Review of the Operation of the FRAB" and was published in December 1998. So the Treasury has met its commitment to the PAC and the Treasury
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
Committee. I am happy to share my copy of the review with the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams). The problem is that it does not cover the independence and operation of the board properly in the way that we seek. For example, when the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy considered—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I assumed that the hon. Gentleman was making an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says. As has been said, the proposal cannot be judged until we have seen resource accounting in action, which would mean a considerable delay. My proposal would provide an opportunity for early deliberation and an early decision could be taken to solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his comments. Some of us are confused about whether the review has taken place. I have in my hand the document to which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred. It is a review of the operation of the FRAB and it was presented to Parliament, or certainly the PAC in December 1998. That review was reported on and it is worth bearing in mind that all those concerned found it satisfactory.<br><br>
We want to ensure that independence is adequate and certain. I believe that the clause already provides that, but I take note of the remarks that have been made and undertake to think further about them. I am not undertaking to introduce amendments on Report, but I shall consider whether any further modification would assist in ensuring continued independence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that extremely positive response, made on the hoof by the Minister. Will she undertake that, in the intervening period, she will discuss the matter with the PAC?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to have on-going discussions with hon. Members interested in the topic, especially with members of the PAC, and to discuss any of the topics with others, especially while we are debating the Bill. I emphasise that I am not promising to make any proposals; I am promising to continue to think about the matter and to meet to discuss it with him if, as I think that he will, he so wishes. I do not undertake to make any proposals on Report; I would not want the Committee to feel misled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do you wish to make a contribution, Mr. Davey?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I leave it to the hon. Member for West Dorset.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a moment, I thought that we were getting somewhere; I am bound to say that we are not. I suppose that the Minister's further consideration and discussion might lead to positive proposals, but she has been honest and open in saying that she is not committed to making proposals. In the circumstances, and given the nature of the review that has so far been conducted, the Minister has effectively said that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
Treasury sees no reason to alter the situation represented by the Bill—that the Treasury can decide and that it should go on deciding. That position can be described only as naive.<br><br>
The Minister fell briefly into error when she misdescribed the position of the CAG but, much more seriously, she sought by a series of eloquent rhetorical devices to evade the problem that the FRAB is an "AB"—an advisory board. It does not have the power to set standards or to determine the extent of deviation from the standards for national accounting applied in the private sector. She argued that it was not right to have a body in competition with the ASB. I understand the force of that logic. We entirely accept the proposition that the national accounts commission or the FRAB, if put on a statutory footing and given statutory authority to set standards, should be restricted in scope to setting the extent and character of the deviation from statements of standard accounting practice, the actions of the urgent issues group, the urgent issues task force or whatever is set by the SSAP. That would be a perfectly reasonable articulation; there would be no question of competition, the starting point would be an acceptance of the ASB and the inquiry conducted by the new body, or by the existing body if given statutory powers, would be restricted to deciding how far there should be deviations.<br><br>
I fear that that strips away the entire logic of the Minister's remarks—nothing is left. She found no reason for objecting to the idea of an independent body; indeed, she said that the FRAB was one. She found no reason for objecting to the idea of someone settling the extent of deviation; she said that the FRAB was such a body able to determine that. What is her argument for denying that body the statutory authority to do that? She has no argument. That is a most remarkable state of affairs.<br><br>
The Bill gives unlimited discretion to the Treasury under circumstances in which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has noted, discretion will be much more important than it currently is because the move from cash to resource accounting creates greater scope for definitional dexterity. The Minister ought at least to have an argument, dreamt up on her behalf by some Sir Humphrey, for defending the instantly untenable proposition that no one should determine the extent of the deviation from private sector accounts, but the Minister does not even proffer such an argument. The Committee can reasonably conclude only that it is not the Minister whom we are hearing, but the forces of conservatism inside Whitehall, which have found it inconvenient to admit the principle that an external authority should determine the extent of deviation from private sector principles. That is untenable and unacceptable and I cannot believe that Ministers would, on reflection, want to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek an important point of clarification to which we shall return, whatever the Minister's decision, on Report. As a preamble to a point of order, Mr. Hood, if an amendment is defeated in Committee, is it more difficult to resurrect it on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
Report than it would have been if it had been withdrawn after a Minister's pledge to reconsider it?</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not disappoint the right hon. Gentleman by explaining that the selection of amendments on Report is a matter for Madam Speaker, not the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, I agree with the spirit of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks. We all seek a solution, not a confrontation. It is clear, alas, that there will be no solution now. We would have been happy to await a later solution; we may get a solution, but it may be quite different from what it appears to be here. I cannot imagine that it would be impossible to make adjustments, perhaps by restricting the body's scope to the definition of deviation from private sector standards. We could debate such a proposal on Report. The sad truth remains that Her Majesty's Government, with their vast majority in the House, have determined that Whitehall rules and Parliament loses. The Treasury will continue to dictate matters and the provision will not be changed on Report or in the other place. If it is changed in another place, the same problem will arise when it comes back to this place. We must demonstrate our profound disagreement on this matter; we shall have to conduct a public debate and, eventually, the Government will have to give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what the right hon. Member for Swansea, West said. I would prefer it if my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset did not press the issue today. I am not convinced that the amendments tabled in his name or those of the Liberal spokesman meet all the requirements. I have already expressed serious concerns, as have other members of the Committee. I am sure that members of the Public Accounts Committee will also be concerned when the matter is sent back for consideration. At present, they have not had enough time to examine it. I do not want a confrontational dispute at this stage. One way or another, the issue will be broached again on Report. If the Minister does not seek to return to it then, perhaps the PAC or others will. In view of that point, I ask my hon. Friend not to press the matter to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With some misgivings, if it is the view of the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and of the senior Opposition Member, I acknowledge that there may be some hope of continuing discussion on Report. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton wants to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely hope that the hon. Member for West Dorset will not withdraw his amendment at this stage because I want to address the Committee once more before the end of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I terminate my current speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I just wanted to put on record our pleasure that the Minister is going to think again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just correct the hon. Gentleman? I said that I would continue to think
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
about the issues and would be happy to engage in a discussion outside this sitting with those who wish to take part. I did not say that I was changing my thinking on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I said that the Minister was going to think again. I did not say that she had made any commitment to the Committee to change her position. My pleasure may have been rather premature. I was hoping that she was now open minded, although she was not making any commitments. I hope that she will confirm that that is her position.<br><br>
We have had a very good debate. I hope that when the PAC has its hearing tomorrow it will include some of the points that have been raised and ask the Treasury Minister who appears before it about the review published in December 1998. It would prove very fruitful. When one reads that review, one does not find the kind of things that one would expect. Section 2 deals with the independence of the FRAB but does not analyse the disagreements between the FRAB and the Treasury over the setting of accounting standards during the formation of the <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> and how those disagreements were dealt with.<br><br>
If the Minister's argument is based on the fact that the FRAB exists, its views are taken very seriously by the Treasury and it is Parliament's protection, one would have expected and hoped that its proposals and recommendations would in most, if not all, instances have been accepted by the Treasury. However, I understand that that has not been so. The review published in December 1998 did not even bother to analyse those differences of opinion and how they were resolved.<br><br>
My reading is that the review was rather cursory and did not get to the heart of the matter. When CIPFA published the document entitled "Setting Accounting Standards for the Public Services" in, I think, 1997 after the establishment of the FRAB, it discussed how one could judge whether the FRAB was doing the job that the Treasury Committee and the PAC wanted it to do in bringing independence to standard setting. Paragraph 3.6 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The authority of the Board will only be tested over time and, in particular, on issues where there may be a divergence of view with the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
In other words, CIPFA was saying that the FRAB will only be seen as valid and having met Parliament's concerns if, when there is a divergence of view, it can stand up for its point of view. The review that the Treasury conducted did not even address that question. There is a concern and it is material to this debate.<br><br>
Indeed, in the only report that I could find from the FRAB on the <i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> published in July 1997, it generally accepted that the RAM was prepared fairly but that there were several issues of great concern. They included departmental boundaries—the interaction with resource budgeting, which the hon. Member for West Dorset mentioned earlier—accounting for the effects of changing prices and the incomplete application of the Greenbury code

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
to salary and pension disclosures. In other words, those are major issues.<br><br>
Hon. Members who have followed the rather Byzantine process of establishing resource accounting and budgeting will know that the Treasury has taken on board some of the concerns reported in July 1997, but not all of them. We therefore have evidence, not in the Treasury's review of the operation of the FRAB, but from the FRAB's reports and what has materialised as a result, that the Government have not taken account of its recommendations. Therefore, the accounting standards being set for resource accounting and budgeting have not always gone with the FRAB's recommendations. Our debate has gone to the heart of how resource accounting and budgeting are conducted and what this Parliament and future Parliaments will bequeath. If the Minister is to reconsider, albeit without a commitment to make a change, I urge her to make her open-mindedness genuine.<br><br>
In that spirit, is the Minister prepared to write to Committee members, detailing those instances in which the FRAB recommendations have been turned down by the Treasury? That will enable us to see divergence of views, and how that has been resolved. Is the Minister prepared to meet Committee members, so that we may persuade her to meet concerns that have been raised today? I would be prepared to meet her on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
behalf of the Liberal Democrats and I am sure that the hon. Member for West Dorset would do so on behalf of the Conservatives.<br><br>
Members of all parties have made a constructive engagement in our debate, and I trust that that will have led the Minister to the conclusion that such matters are incredibly serious. It is worth one last attempt to get things right, before we set in stone how accounting standards for the public sector are to be determined for the next 50 or 60 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall delight the Government Whip by admitting that I do not have much to say on this occasion. I have some misgivings. However, I hope that the wiser counsel of the Chairman of the PAC will prove to be accurate and we shall get somewhere in our discussions, notwithstanding the Minister's clear warnings that we may not. I am happy with whatever outcome guarantees genuine independence for the setting of standards, and gives them some teeth. Given the hope that that can be achieved before Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 3.</span></p>
