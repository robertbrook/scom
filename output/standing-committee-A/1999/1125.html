</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this early hour, we reach part XI of the Bill. It deals with the controllers of authorised persons. They exercise control over authorised firms by virtue of holding shares or voting rights in them or being one of their parent companies. I shall refer to those persons as shareholder controllers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Financial Services Authority is aware of the identity of authorised firms and has approved persons who can exert control over their management, as shareholder controllers might in reality call all the shots and can have considerable influence over whether a firm is fit and proper to carry out regulated activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shareholder controllers might not be authorised persons, and the authorised firm cannot necessarily control who buys its shares or votes at its annual general meeting. The FSA cannot, therefore, achieve any hold over the identity of shareholder controllers by way of its rules. It is necessary to introduce statutory requirements that are backed up by criminal sanctions, and that is the purpose of part XI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are based on European Community directive requirements, but we have applied those requirements more widely. Part XI applies to controllers of all authorised firms, not just to classes of firms that are covered by the single market directives. However, the approach is as set out in the directives. The provisions represent an extension, which is in the interests of effective regulation and consumer protection. All classes of firms will be handled in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken advantage of the opportunity that the Bill offers to rationalise the existing patchwork of legislative requirements across the different sectors. That should make life easier for firms. This part of the Bill is a good example of the practical benefits of a single regulator and of our modernising the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another important part of the Bill and we have listened to responses to consultation and made sensible improvements to the original draft. For example, we have limited the requirements to shareholder controllers of firms that are incorporated in or formed under the laws of the United Kingdom. We have also put the control thresholds in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause sets out the basic requirement to notify the FSA of any proposal that will result in an acquisition of new or increased control. It also caters for persons who acquire control without doing anything—for example, because the company restructures its capital. Such passive acquirers must submit notification within two weeks of becoming aware of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
Amendments Nos. 560 and 561 clarify that the requirement to notify applies whether or not a person intends by his action to effect a notifiable acquisition of control. They were tabled in response to suggestions by consultation respondents that the current wording could be taken to apply only to those who purposely acquire control. That was not the intention, and we have clarified the wording to make that clear. Amendments Nos. 600 and 601 make similar changes to clause 159, which deals with the requirement to notify a decrease in control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have tabled several amendments to this part of the Bill, including the clause. The majority of them are drafting amendments, designed to achieve greater clarity. Most of them would fall, given that the Government amendments improve clarity. Therefore, Opposition Members may wish not to press some—or all—of the amendments to a vote. However, of course I am happy to respond to points that they may wish to make in support of their amendments. However, if I understand correctly, the amendments are drafting amendments and would not change the policy intentions of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First. I apologise for being a minute late this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the Government have accepted several matters pertaining to clause 148 and related clauses which have been raised by the industry. The clause deals with defining control. Our amendments take up matters that will be raised in consequential amendments to clauses 149, 150, 159 and 160.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 508 to 510 set the scene for the rest of our amendments in the group. Taken together, their purpose is to tighten the drafting of clause 148, which is concerned with the acquisition of control, additional kinds of control and increases in the relevant kinds of control over a UK authorised person. Failure to comply in such matters is a criminal offence, so it is especially important that definitions should be absolutely clear. People seeking to acquire control or increase control over a UK authorised person ought to know exactly where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the reference in clause 148(1) to
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person who proposes to take any step which will result"</p></blockquote>
is vague and uncertain. At what stage does such a step occur? Is it when the managing director of the acquirer decides to make the acquisition, when his board endorses his decision, or at a later stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 560 goes some way towards recognising the inadequacy of the drafting of the clause. It is an improvement, but does not go quite far enough to provide certainty. Amendment No. 560 uses the word "step", which is slightly confusing, as "step" is given a particular meaning in clauses 150 and 151.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 508 and 509 would clarify the position and put it beyond doubt. They would also
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>
mirror corresponding provisions in regulation 41 of the Investment Services Regulations 1995, which implement in UK law the investment services directive. Our amendments are consistent with the relevant provisions of that directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive and regulations do not refer to steps which someone proposes to take. Indeed, the requirements in those measures are straightforward and clear, specifying that someone cannot acquire or increase control of an authorised person unless the competent authority is first notified. As clause 150 states, the criminal sanction for breach requires a procedure with no room for uncertainty. Amendments Nos. 508 and 509 make plain that reference to taking steps should be removed and replaced with reference to the action to be taken by the relevant person, or not taken, as the case may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 510 is consequential on amendments Nos. 508 and 509. Amendments Nos. 513, 516, 517, 518, 519, 524 and 525 are also consequential upon those two amendments. I should like to say a little about amendments Nos. 511 and 512. Although amendment No. 511 would delete 20 lines in clause 149, its purpose is to use the definition of controller in clause 358. That definition is exactly the same as the wording in clause 149(1) to (3) and we feel that it is simpler and clearer to use that definition and reduce the words used in clause 149 to a minimum. Amendment No. 512 is consequential on amendment No. 511.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we achieve what we are seeking to achieve with these amendments, we shall withdraw the amendments that have been selected for debate on clause 149, as they will not be necessary. Amendment Nos. 514 and 515 relate to clause 156. Clause 156(2)(b) refers to the interests of a person who uses the services of the relevant authorised person being threatened when the acquirer acquires control. "Threatened" is not a particularly precise word to use in a statute of this type and we believe "prejudiced" would be more suitable and perhaps better understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 519 to 523 to clause 159 deal with cases where a person ceases to have control or reduces his control of a UK-authorised person. Again, there is a requirement to notify the FSA before taking the relevant action. Under clause 160 it is a criminal offence to fail to give such notice. For the same reasons as those on clause 148, we believe that greater certainty is required. Amendments 519 and 520 follow the same approach adopted by amendments Nos. 508 and 509 and the other amendments are consequential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the nightmare territory is now covered. There is not much difference between us here. The Government accept that the clarity of definition is necessary here. The issue is self-evidently whether Government amendment No. 560 and the consequential amendments provide adequate clarity. We do not feel that they do, particularly, with regard to "steps". Our formula is a rather neater way of tidying up here. This is not a territory of earthshaking political principle: if the Government do not wish to accept our amendments now, perhaps they might think about them and deal with the points on Report. They
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>937</span>
might conclude that amendment No. 560 does not quite meet the need here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging that there is greater clarity following the Government amendments. Let me respond in particular to amendments Nos. 511, 512 and 513, which would remove the definition of control from clause 149 would refer instead to clause 356, where the definition of "controller" appears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Control is the key concept for the purposes of this part of the Bill as it covers not only acquisitions of control, but increases and reductions in control, and acquisitions of a new kind of control. I do not think that those concepts fit well side by side with the idea of "controller". Clause 149 uses control; it sets out the relevant types of control and gives a context on which clauses 150 and 151 can build. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would oblige us to say that acquisition of control means becoming a controller. We would then have to refer to clause 356 for the definition of "controller" and translate that back into the concept of acquiring control, to make sense of the way in which a person acquired a different control and how he increases or reduces it. While I accept that, technically, that approach works, it is actually rather more complicated to have the provision here instead of in part XI, which takes a rather more straightforward approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's comments on his other amendments in relation to the phrase "taking steps" and the danger of ambiguity. He made a fair point which I shall be glad to consider to see whether we can do anything further to tighten the provision. If we can, we will come back on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 561, in page 73, line 10, at beginning insert 'he'.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 562, in page 73, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'A person who is under the duty to notify the Authority imposed by subsection (1) must also give notice to the Authority on acquiring, or increasing, the control in question.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment. No. 563.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment will make the controller's regime more useful to the FSA and allow for more effective regulation. When the authority gives approval to a would-be controller under clause 154, it remains valid for a time. The default is one year, although if the authority wishes, it can specify a different period. Although there is a provision in clause 159 requiring persons to notify the FSA when they reduce their control, there is no equivalent provision relating to increased control. That means that at any one time the authority cannot have a complete picture of who does and who does not have control over authorised persons. The position is far from ideal. Amendment No. 562, therefore, includes an express requirement for persons to notify the FSA a second time when they acquire control for which they have received approval. Members of the Committee will note that no criminal sanction is attached to this requirement: this is deliberate because we do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
consider it proportionate that failure to comply with the requirement should result in criminal charges. However, it will be a ground for the FSA to object to the person continuing to have control. This is provided for in subsection (1) of our new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 563 is consequential. It makes it clear that when a person notifies the FSA of an acquisition, such a notice is not to be regarded as a notice of control. The provisions in the remainder of the part that relate to notices of control do not apply to this type of notification. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 151 and 152 would make it clear that "shares" in subsection (2) (a) and (c) refers to voting shares. Voting shares confer control and the power to control, so it is not sensible to refer to shares in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 153 would make it clear that a person should not be regarded as exercising or controlling the exercise of voting power—in subsection (2) (e) and (g) for example—
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he cannot do so in his own discretion".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the thrust of the amendments as the hon. Gentleman explains them—to cut back the notification requirement to those who have the right to vote at AGMs and who can decide how to exercise that right. However, cutting back the regulatory burden is not possible in this sphere. As I explained, the controller's regime is modelled on the requirements of the single market directives, which are comprehensive in terms of the types of shares and shareholders covered.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that voting control is laid down in another way, or is it a practical regulation that includes non-voting shares? It is the substance that matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directives set out that, whether the person has a direct or indirect holding in capital or voting rights, he is required to submit a notification.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly do so and circulate the directives—there are several of them—to the Committee, but I understand that the circumstances are fully and clearly spelled out in the directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his comments and I echo the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell).

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a very good reason why the directives include non-voting shares. Even if a shareholder does not have voting rights, he may be able to control the firm's affairs by, for example, threatening to sell the shares if the directors do not do as he says. That would not be a hollow threat. If a shareholder sold out, not only would there be a danger that the share price might fall, but the very fact of a large shareholder divesting could worry market observers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is essential that our legislation should keep in step with the directives. The provision is not a thoughtless addition to the regulatory burden. There are genuine and legitimate reasons why these steps are being taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one probing question relating to amendment No. 153, which states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person shall not be regarded as being able to exercise or control the exercise of voting powers if he cannot do so in his own discretion".</p></blockquote>
Let us consider those who hold shares as nominees. Will nominee companies be obliged to carry out elaborate administrative requirements in that capacity? That could prove onerous and almost impractical, making it difficult for companies to act as nominees. Thought should be given to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me respond fully to amendment No. 153, which seeks to exclude persons whose shares confer voting rights, but who do not control the exercise of those rights. At first glance, the amendment might seem reasonable, but we believe that it would
	<span class='label label-info column'>940</span>
seriously undermine the efficacy of the regime. In practice, the FSA might not know who controls voting rights, or, indeed, whether votes are determined by anybody other than the person whose name appears on the register of shareholders. Therefore, the requirement that the person in whose name those voting rights appear should notify the FSA will give it an important regulatory handle. It will be able to ascertain from such persons the basis on which they are entitled to vote and, where those rights result from shares held on someone else's behalf, their identities. The amendment would remove that handle by allowing people to exercise effective control over authorised firms without the FSA's knowledge. We do not want to allow that. Moreover, the directives do not allow for such a change. As I have said, they refer to voting rights but make no reference to who controls the exercise of them, so our discretion is limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given a good answer to those amendments that would introduce the word "voting", but does not appear to have addressed the question of nominee companies. I am worried that a business that acts as a nominee and is required, but fails, to go through administrative procedures in respect of shares that it holds merely as a nominee might contravene the FSA's requirements in a way that would enable the FSA to remove its rights properly to operate as a controller in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gravamen of the Minister's argument was that amendment No. 153 would remove a valuable handle for the FSA. That is all very well—we do not want to make the FSA powerless—but we are concerned not with the FSA's having valuable handles, which the Bill will provide in spades, but with a fair procedure that does not put honest and careful City operators at technical risk of losing their licences and powers to control. Will the Minister consider the matter that we have identified in the past five minutes and assure us in due course that our worries are unfounded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are anxious that, as well as giving the FSA adequate powers, we comply with the requirements of EU law. I shall reflect on the question of nominee companies which the right hon. and learned Gentleman raised and, if necessary, return to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I repeat the point and ask the Minister to consider that our approach in amendment No. 151 would avoid the problems to which our subsequent amendments relate?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 152 gives the FSA power to specify what should be included in a notice of control and enables the FSA to ask a potential controller for additional information or documents, when reasonable, to assist him in deciding whether to approve, to impose conditions or to object to a particular notice of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments have three purposes. First, they remove all references to directions in writing to avoid problems that might arise if the FSA used alternative media—a topic that we have come across in previous sittings. Secondly, amendment No. 564 adds a missing reference to documents in subsection (1)(b). Thirdly, as a result of amendment No. 567 the FSA will be able to require different controllers and controllers of different authorised firms to provide different information and documents. That will give the FSA greater flexibility to take account of the fact that various controllers are required to notify under the regime, minimising the burden placed on potential controllers by the requirement to notify. The information required by the FSA will be different in relation to individuals who wish to have a 10 per cent. shareholding in a small independent financial adviser and in relation to an institution wishing to become the parent of a major bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments align part XI with the equivalent provisions in parts IV and V of the Bill—clauses 46 and 57—which allow the authority to give different directions in relation to the content of applications for permission and approval respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An equivalent power under clause 157 allows the FSA to require additional information to be produced by existing controllers when the FSA is minded to give a notice of objection to their continuing control. I shall not pre-empt debate on that clause now or on the power to object to existing controllers, except to say that amendments Nos. 595, 596 and 597 amend that clause in a similar manner and for the same reasons.

9.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 568 and 604 delete references to the term "completed", with reference to a notice of control, from clauses 153 and 160. The term is unnecessary, as a notice of control includes all the information and documents required under clause 152(1)(b). There is no such thing as an incomplete notice of control. It is either a notice of control or it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of the amendments cover the procedure for dealing with notices of control, given to the authority under clause 148, and are unobjectionable. Similarly, amendment No. 565,

which removes the requirement for requests from the FSA for additional information to be in writing, and amendment No. 566, which changes the words "may reasonably require" to "considers reasonable", give the FSA a little more discretion and are not objectionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present regime there have been problems in the transaction of international bids in getting the Securities and Investments Board or the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation to meet the timetables required for their responses to such notices. I hope that we shall now have a clear regime that the FSA will be able to operate efficiently, as that has not been the case in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Government new clause 7—	<i>Objection to existing control.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that hon. Members have received the revised versions of clauses 153, 156 and 157, following the application of the Government amendments. They have been provided in response to Members' concerns about not being able to see the full impact of Government amendments, and should have reached everyone by yesterday lunchtime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments concern the structure of those three clauses. Hon. Members will have noticed when reading this part of the Bill that there is an overlap between clauses 153 and 157. Clause 153 sets out the procedure that the authority must follow when it is given a notice of control. That is, briefly, that it must decide during a three-month period whether to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
approve of the proposed acquisition or to serve a warning notice that it is minded to attach conditions to its approval or that it is minded to object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 157 provides for what the authority should do if it is minded to object, whether in response to a new notice of control or to an existing controller. An overlap arises because the procedure for objecting to a new notice of control is included in both clauses, which is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and those grouped with it will deal with the problem. They clarify the fact that the clause refers to the procedure in relation to new notices of control and that clause 157 involves the procedure that is relevant when the FSA wants to object to an existing controller. That clearer separation will also involve the clauses that will give the FSA the power to object. Clause 156, as amended, makes provision only for the power to object to a new notice of control, and new clause 7 makes provision for the power to object to existing controllers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should clarify the fact that persons who acquire control passively and notify as required under clause 148(2) are not regarded as existing controllers, although, of course, they will already have control at the point at which the FSA considers the notice. The powers and procedures relating to such passive notifiers involve clauses 156 and 153 respectively. However, if a passive acquirer fails to notify as required under clause 148(2), the powers and procedures for existing controllers under new clause 7 and clause 157 would apply.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 570, in page 75, line 38, leave out subsections (3) and (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take Government amendment No. 598.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 152 states what people have to do to notify the FSA, and clause 153 sets out the procedure that the FSA must follow when it receives a notice of control. It has three months from the day on which it receives a notice of a control to decide whether to approve of that notice or to issue a warning notice stating that it is minded to object or to attach conditions to its approval. That three-month period is required by the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is currently drafted, if the FSA requires additional information under clause 152, the time that is taken for the information to be produced is added to the three months, or, to put it the other way round, the clock stops at the point of the request and the process starts again when the request has been met. On further reflection, it is our view that that clock-pausing mechanism is not compatible with the directives, which state that there must be a decision within three months of the notification. Under clock pausing,
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
the FSA could in theory take considerably longer than three months, because it might have to ask for additional information on several occasions. Amendment No. 570 will remove subsections (3) and (4) from the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clock pausing is also currently applicable to clause 157, which will allow the FSA to ask for additional information from existing controllers. Amendment No. 598 will delete the relevant subsections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change will obviously be welcomed by potential controllers and probably by Conservative Members. The relevant bodies will know where they stand sooner. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment inserts a definition of "acquirer" to ensure that it is clear that the term includes both persons acquiring control for the first time and persons increasing the extent of their control.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments clarify the drafting of clause 156. Amendments Nos. 575, 576 and 582 replace the phrase "conditions for approval" with "approval requirements". That will ensure that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>945</span>
there is no confusion between the requirements that a person must meet in order for their control to be approved and the conditions that the FSA may attach to a person's acquisition of control under clause 155. Amendment No. 583 simply corrects the grammar in subsection (3). Amendments Nos. 577, 578, 579 and 580 ensure that the approval requirements are drafted in such a way that they are relevant to all potential or existing controllers. The current drafting does not achieve that because of its use of the conditional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important because the regime is based on the fact that a person must not only meet the approval requirements to acquire control, but continue to meet those requirements throughout the period in which they have control. If they do not, the FSA will have the power to object to their maintaining that control. If it were necessary to meet the requirements only once, most of the advantages of effective regulation and consumer protection would be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say a few words about the two Opposition amendments. Clause 156(2)(b) stipulates one of the factors that the authority must take into account when considering whether a person should be approved to have control over an authorised person. In the case of paragraph (b), the issue is the threat that control might pose to people whom we may describe for these purposes as customers. I use that word in a neutral, non-specific way to make it easier to step back and consider who exactly is relevant for these purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 514 would make the customers who are relevant to the authority's consideration the customers only of the authorised person himself rather than a wider class of customer. Clause 156(2)(b), as currently drafted, allows the authority to take into account the implications of the control on the customers of any authorised person. In reality, however, it is not that wide-ranging. In practice, the authority's ability to object to control is constrained to ground on which it is reasonable for it to take a particular view. That implies that in order for the authority to object, there must be a direct link between the authorised person concerned and the authorised persons whose customers the authority is seeking to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rationale for referring to authorised persons in the plural was that in some circumstances a change of control might pose risks that are of a systemic nature, and the FSA should be able to take those risks into account. For example, the takeover of a reinsurance company could have implications for retail policyholders of a direct insurance company, and the change of ownership of a trader in wholesale markets could pose a risk to retail customers of other firms with which it trades. We must therefore ensure that adequate protections exist to address such concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 515 is to enable the authority not to approve of someone's control of an authorised person, where the authority believes that such control might be detrimental to the interests of users of the services of authorised persons. The point at issue is the nature of the test that should be applied
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
by the authority in exercising its judgment. I would not wish to overstate the difference between the words "threatened" and "prejudiced". "Prejudiced" would imply a degree of likelihood, if not certainty, about the outcome of the events, although those events would not necessarily be especially serious. "Threatened" would imply that the chances of something happening would be far from certain, although, were it to happen, it would cause more serious harm. "Threatened" better conveys the kind of risk that the provision is intended to address. If a company were to take over a bank, which, as a result, paid a slightly lower rate of interest to deposit account holders, the interests of those customers might be prejudiced. However, that would not be sufficient grounds for the authority to object to the new parent—customers would be able to move their deposits to another institution paying better rates of interest. The less likely but more serious risk would be that the change of control might result in the bank not being able to repay depositors when they wanted access to their money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current drafting is consistent with section 22(1)(b) of the Banking Act 1987, so I would prefer to retain the current formulation, which achieves the right result. Opposition Members will no doubt want to comment on that, although, in the light of my explanation, I hope that they will not press their amendments to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Financial Secretary said, the various Government amendments are of a drafting nature. Although they make considerable changes to clause 156(4) and (5), we have no objections to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for referring to amendments Nos. 514 and 515 earlier. I was pleased to hear the Government's responses in advance, but I am not sure whether their point about authorised persons is correct. Clause 1 58(2)(b) refers to the control of the authorised person, which is the subject of the notice. That is hardly an earth-shaking issue, although the Government might consider whether the use of the plural achieves what is intended. On amendment No. 515, we felt that "threatened" was not a particularly precise word for use in statute. "Prejudiced" may not be much better—and we will not press the amendments to a vote—but the drafting is not as good as it might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause provides for such criminal offences, but the current drafting is not quite right in relation to persons

To improve that provision, amendments Nos. 602, 603 and 609 separate offences that apply to active acquirers and disacquirers from those that apply to passive ones. Amendment No. 610 changes subsection (9), so that it applies only to active acquirers and disacquirers, as it is irrelevant to passive ones. The amendments largely address the problems with the clause, but we will consider whether further technical changes are needed to achieve exactly the result that we are after.

The other amendments make various consequential changes that are needed in the light of earlier amendments to this part of the Bill. For example, the amendments to subsection (3) are needed because a warning notice that the authority is minded to object to a new notice of control is now provided for under clause 153(5), rather than under clause 157,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INTERPRETATION OF THIS PART</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We move now to part XII of the Bill. This territory relates back to clause 28 and schedules 3 and 4. The Economic Secretary, sadly, is not here this morning, but the Committee may remember that we had some concerns about whether the provisions would work and there has been correspondence between myself and the Economic Secretary, articulating the concerns that the lawyers who advise us have expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those concerns have not been fully put to bed. There are three issues on which we still have questions.
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
I apologise to the Committee; it was not possible to table amendments to part XII in sufficient time, but we have tabled starred amendments to draw technical points to the Minister's attention. Under clause 162, can a firm carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom only if it is physically present in the United Kingdom either as a branch or by a visit—or can it engage in the regulated activity from outside the UK by means of remote communication? That is a central issue on how passporting works. To hark back to schedule 4, it gives the firm the right to carry on the activity providing services in the UK through the UK branch. We have assumed that the question whether an activity is carried on in the UK must be determined by UK law, which means that if advice is given to an investor in the UK, or someone enters into a transaction with an investor in the UK from outside the UK, the regulated activity of giving that advice or entering into the transaction should be treated as the provision of services in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expression "exercise an EEA right" also comes up in schedule 3. The Commission's 1997 guidance on the second banking directive—and, we assume, the investment services directive, although the guidance does not refer to it—does not give an EEA right to provide services unless not only the recipient of the service, the consumer, but the provider of the service, the EEA firm, is present in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point needs clarification in schedules 3 and 4. We are concerned about the application of schedule 4 in relation to part XII of the Bill. A key point is that paragraph 3(1)(c) of schedule 4 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the firm has no EEA right to carry on that activity."</p></blockquote>
The Treasury has given a helpful response to most of our queries on that territory. However, we have not been told whether the territorial extent of schedule 4 is the same as that of schedule 3, something that still needs to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify, with the Minister's help, where we are in respect of the provision of services in the United Kingdom. Clause 162(1)(b) refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a Treaty firm which is exercising, or has exercised, its right to carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom in accordance with schedule 4".</p></blockquote>
I shall give an example, although I suspect that it will be overcome because the company that I want to cite is regulated in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AXA now owns one of the large insurance companies—I have a policy with it, but I cannot remember its name. However, AXA certainly owns pension fund providers in the UK. It is likely that some UK citizens, operating on their own account, and probably on the internet, will wish to make their pension provisions with companies that operate from abroad—within the European Union or beyond. It seems entirely possible that such a business can be carried out without the provider having a presence in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 162 focuses on those who engage in a regulated activity from outside the United Kingdom by means of remote communication, including e-mail, ordinary letters and telephone calls. One can thus send
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
letters and hard copy documents that can be signed and returned. Such business could be carried on perfectly well by a UK citizen without him ever meeting the person with whom he was doing business—and without the person with whom he was doing business ever setting foot in Britain or using an agent in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that that will happen, but to what extent will such activity be regulated? Will such a person be providing services in the UK under schedule 4 or schedule 3, which I understand will need to be read in conjunction with clause 162. Clarification would be extremely helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power of intervention to which clause 162 refers is set out in clause 165, which allows the authority to impose requirements on a firm as if its permission was a part IV permission. However, there seems to be no explanation of what a firm's permission is, and we feel that it ought to be defined. We believe that it means permission granted as a result of the EEA right under schedule 3 or schedule 4, but it would help if it was spelled out in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause simply defines terms used elsewhere in part XII of the Bill. The Government amendments for this and the next part of the Bill were made available to members of the Committee yesterday, which I hope has helped to overcome some of the difficulties that we had in our sitting earlier this week. We shall attempt to continue that practice for future Government amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to answer the questions posed by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell) about physical presence. If I do not do so fully, they can drop me a note so that I am absolutely clear about what I am being asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential question was whether firms needed to be physically present in the UK to be treated as carrying on business here, and the answer is no. It is possible, as hon. Members said, for business to be conducted virtually. The question whether business is being carried on here for the purposes of this part of the Bill is a matter of the interpretation of the single market directives, which refer back to the freedom to provide services under the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the questions took us back to our discussions on earlier parts of the Bill, but I hope that I have answered those that related to part XII. If Committee members tell me in writing that further clarification is needed, I will ensure that it is provided as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The boot seems to be on the other foot now, because it seems to be for me to write to the Minister. I do not mind writing to him, but I am putting my questions into black letter and they will be visible tomorrow in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I gave an example so that our discussion could be read and understood by those who follow these proceedings. Let me try to put the question very simply and get the Minister's answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>
In a sense, we dealt with the matter earlier in the Bill because the way in which it is constructed is necessarily interlocking. We are bound to come round again and again to the same issues because different parts of the structure interlink to create what is intended to be a comprehensive and comprehensible whole. However, unless I ask questions and give hypothetical examples, it certainly will not be comprehensible to the ordinary reader. Indeed, I am afraid that it is not comprehensible to me, so I shall have another go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that one enters into a pension policy with somebody who carries on business outside the United Kingdom—in France or the Cayman Islands, to take two quite separate examples. One can carry on all one's business by letter, telephone and e-mail over the internet; indeed, one will probably get much of one's information from the internet or from circulars and mail shots that are sent to this country. How does that tie in with subsection (1)(b), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a Treaty firm which is exercising, or has exercised, its right to carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom in accordance with Schedule 4",</p></blockquote>
and with subsection (1)(a), which refers to an EEA firm which has a
	<br><blockquote><p>"right to carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom in accordance with Schedule 3"?</p></blockquote>
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bottom line is whether, if one does business with a firm that operates outside the United Kingdom—let us take the example of the Cayman Islands and say that the firm is not a treaty firm—such business is wholly unregulated and carried on at one's own risk. If so, how will people know and be warned about that? What rights will the Cayman Islands pension provider have to enforce its business? None at all, I would think. What penalties might people operating from the Cayman Islands suffer if they came here for a holiday or on other business? Could they be arrested?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the regulatory system tie in with the real world in which people live, work and make pension and other financial advisory provisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The specific EU passporting point that I seek to make is that, under the investment services directive and the Commission's 1997 guidance and second banking directive, an EEA business does not have the right to provide the service unless it and its customer are physically located in the UK. It may therefore fall foul of the EU passport, if one accepts the common-sense point that it provides a service and is regulated towards those based in the UK, regardless of whether it is actually in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will have a go. The clause deals with EEA firms and treaty firms, so the situations of firms in France and the Cayman Islands are rather different. Schedules 3 and 4 are based on the freedom to provide Services set out in the treaty, and the single market directives are an elaboration of how that basic freedom operates on the subject of financial services. Questions of jurisdiction that arise from new technology will need to be addressed in that context. Businesses will not be unregulated, however, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>953</span>
schedules 3 and 4 are based on the assumption that a firm is authorised in its EEA home state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a Cayman Islands firm offered services in the UK, in the sense of clause 353, it would be covered by parts II, III and IV of the Bill, not by schedules 3 and 4 or part XII. That separate issue is dealt with elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 687—a starred amendment—relates to the need for permission to be defined. Some references in this part of the Bill—for example, that in clause 165(a)—are to part IV permissions. The definition of an incoming firm in clause 162(1) clearly relates to schedule 3 and 4 permissions. Amendment No. 637 would not therefore work. However, I am happy to give the assurance for which I was asked at the outset: we will consider all the amendments and take any action needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made some progress in answering hon. Gentlemen's questions. If I have not, no doubt there will further interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made some progress. I have looked back through parts II, III and IV and it is pretty basic stuff. Part II relates to regulated and prohibited activities; part III to authorisation and exemption and part IV to permission to carry on regulated activities. I concede the answer to my own questions to be that, if a firm operates from the Cayman Islands and has not taken the trouble to become authorised in the United Kingdom, the business will be unregulated. If the citizen chooses to do business with such a firm, either by letters, telephone calls or e-mails, he will be unprotected by the regulatory system because the firm will be unable to enforce the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would express that the other way around. If the Cayman Islands firm is carrying on business in this country, it will need to be authorised by the FSA. That is the position in law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will need to be, but, under the clause, it ain't. It would be carrying on business. What will the Minister do about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that United Kingdom law will require, under the parts of the Bill that the right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned, such a firm to be authorised by the FSA. People can attempt to operate outside UK law, but its requirements on that company are clear. For his other example of a company in France, the measures in this part, and in schedules 3 and 4, would apply. With the Cayman Islands firm, they would not, so the firm would have apply for authorisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I went into the vernacular, but the Minister gave me a fair answer. I merely think that this points up the difficulties in this area—and that would be so if we were in government. I think that the Minister agrees—and I should be grateful for a nod or word of confirmation of that—that, if someone did business with a firm from, say, the Cayman Islands, about which I have no complaint, and the firm had not been authorised here, there would be no practical impediment to a person doing that business, but he would not have the benefit of knowing that the firm
	<span class='label label-info column'>954</span>
was regulated—because it will not be. It would risk being unable to enforce its deals and its officials might be arrested for quite serious criminal offences if they came to this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right. Someone who came to the UK on business that was not authorised would be commiting a criminal offence. Of course, much would depend on exactly what he did. In response to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's earlier point, that company's contracts would be unenforceable against a UK consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 611, in page 81, line 34, leave out from 'contravened' to end of line 36 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>`,or is likely to contravene, a requirement which is imposed on it by or under this Act (in a case where the Authority is responsible for enforcing compliance in the United Kingdom);'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 612 to 615.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part XII relates to intervention against persons who are authorlsed by virtue of the directives or the assertion of a treaty right under Schedule 4, but the powers apply only in relation to the activities carried on by virtue of schedule 3 or schedule 4. If the person has additional permission under part IV, intervention in relation to those activities would take the form of a variation, or cancellation, of that permission in the same way as for any other person with part IV permission. There may therefore be circumstances in which the FSA will need to exercise powers under this part and part IV of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU directives impose limitations on the circumstances in which the FSA may exercise its powers and contain specific requirements relating to the way in which the FSA may exercise them. That is reflected in the grounds for intervention under this part, which is what clause 163 is about, and in the procedural aspects, which we will come to when we consider the rest of part XII and clauses 166 to 174 in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 163 sets out the four grounds on which the FSA may exercise its power of intervention. The first three grounds are set out in subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3), which is qualified by subsections (2) and (4), is an additional ground that applies in the case of an EEA firm that is carrying on consumer credit business in the UK under its passport. We shall discuss that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is fairly technical, but it makes substantial improvements to the condition that is contained in subsection (1)(a), which applies to a firm that fails to comply with a requirement that is imposed by the FSA in accordance with its role as the host state regulator. When the FSA considers whether to exercise that power, it may take into account contraventions of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>955</span>
requirements and the likelihood that breaches are about to be committed. The amendment clarifies the fact that the FSA may take preventive and remedial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment clarifies the fact that contraventions that give rise to action by the FSA involve breaches of FSA rules and of the Bill's requirements. Amendment No. 612 does the same in relation to subsection (2)(b). The amendment makes it clear that those powers are available in relation to treaty firms and those that operate within the terms of the single market directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those changes will bring subsection (1)(a) fully into line with case B in clause 40, which is in part IV of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause states that the FSA can exercise its power of intervention if a firm contravenes a requirement that has been imposed by the FSA. That is the FSA's responsibility in accordance with the single market directive. However, there is no single market directive in the case of a treaty firm. It exercises its freedom not under the single market directive but under the terms of article 49 of the treaty. Should not that situation be straightened out? In this context, one could define a firm as, for example, an incoming EEA firm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) is an additional ground that applies in the case of an EEA firm that is carrying on consumer credit business in the UK under its passport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (3), the FSA can intervene where the Director General of Fair Trading has informed the FSA that a person has done any of the things that are listed in section 25(2) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 613 is a technical drafting amendment. Amendment No. 614 will delete subsection (4), which limits the use of the power to intervene under subsection (3) to additional part IV
	<span class='label label-info column'>956</span>
permissions. It should not do that. Intervention in relation to additional permissions is dealt with in part IV. This power will apply to activities carried on under the passport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 615 will make a minor drafting improvement by defining certain terms in the clause through reference to the definition of those terms under clause 174.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister happy with the use of the phrase "deposit-taking", which he may recall was also used in clause 40? When we were told during discussion of that clause that the Government had not realised that there was anything wrong with the phrase, but that they would look again at it, we suggested a change in the wording. The point that we made then arises here. The director general's power under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 refers only to particular kinds of credit, which are listed in clause 174. As far as the second banking directive is concerned, the relevant activity is lending, which is defined in its annexe. If all the activities listed in the annexe will be covered by the clause, that is fine, but it would be silly to limit them to the accepted deposits with which the clause currently deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ISD covers consumer credit because it allows firms authorised by it to provide investment services and to grant credits or loans to investors to enable them to buy securities. That is why reference is also made to the annexe to the ISD.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is right: we discussed the matter earlier and Opposition Committee members made some important points, which we said that we would take on board.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The amendment is a direct response to our discussion of clause 40, and will remove the reference to deposit-taking. In the light of that discussion, we shall also be able to make the same change to clause 40 in good time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>957</span>
request of, or for the purposes of assisting, an overseas regulatory authority. The relevant authorities are primarily those with responsibility for regulating insurance and deposit-taking undertakings and investment service companies. However, other bodies such as those responsible for functions relating to the listing of shares, or functions such as those exercised in the UK by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry under the Companies Acts, may also be included. Different arrangements will apply, according to whether or not the regulator is in another EEA member state and some obligation exists to comply with the request, in accordance with the system of home state regulation that operates under the directives. The same arrangements will apply in principle to treaty rights. Where such an obligation applies, subsection (5) makes it clear that the FSA must comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of cases where there is no such obligation, subsection (6) lists a number of factors that the FSA may take into account in deciding whether it should comply with the request. The exercise of the power is discretionary. The FSA may decline a request if it is not satisfied on any of these grounds, or for any other relevant reason. Subsection (7) enables the FSA to make compliance conditional on the relevant authority making an appropriate contribution to any costs that the FSA may incur in exercising the power. That does not apply where the FSA is obliged to take action as a result of a Community obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendments have a common thread in that they broaden the circumstances in which the FSA is bound to comply with the request, and thus bring the clause closer into line with clause 42 in part IV. As drafted, the clause refers only to the obligation of the FSA to exercise the powers because of a provision in the single market directives. That is too narrow. Although the directives give particular substance to such obligations to co-operate, it is likely that similar obligations apply where firms are exercising treaty rights. The amendments therefore substitute references to the single market directives with references to Community obligations. In line with that, amendment No. 616 replaces the term "EEA regulator" with the term "home state regulator", which is used in schedules 3 and 4 and applies both to EEA and treaty firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 622 improves the drafting of subsection (7), which gives the FSA the ability to make an appropriate contribution to costs a condition for exercise. Amendment No. 623 makes it clear that that ability does not apply where there is a Community obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the changes that are brought about by the amendments are necessary in order properly to fulfil our international obligations. We have also taken the opportunity to improve certain aspects of the Bill's drafting. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives the authority an unrestricted right to decide whether the power of intervention should be exercised as a matter of urgency. That short-circuits the normal procedures, and the Government should consider applying the normal limitations. In any case, the single market directives limit the right to take emergency action. They allow it only when it is necessary to protect the interests of investors and others to whom the services are provided, as under article 19(8) of the investment services directive, or when it is necessary to protect the interests of depositors, investors and others to whom services are provided. A restriction that covers both those alternatives should apply when it is necessary to protect the interest of consumers, as is required under European Union law. Without that, the measure might be in contravention of that law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal is consistent with EU law. There could be instances in which intervention could be urgent, and the clause provides that in those circumstances the FSA does not have to give a warning notice, but instead goes directly to issuing a decision notice. The requirements imposed by the notice will then come into force as soon as it is served on the person concerned. An example of the situation that we envisage might be one in which the home state
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>959</span>
authorities from another EEA state informed the FSA of an emerging crisis concerning a bank from that state, in which case swift action would be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA must give the authorised person a reasonable period of not less than 28 days to make representations, and must then decide within a reasonable period after that whether to rescind or alter the original decision. That is a safeguard. In addition, the authorised person has an immediate right to refer the matter to the tribunal following the issuing of the notice. Alternatively, he or she may prefer to make representations, in which case he or she can still refer the matter if not satisfied with the response. The tribunal is specifically directed by subsection (10) to consider not only the risks that the immediate intervention was aimed to forestall, but the impact on the authorised person referring the matter. There are, therefore, a number of safeguards built in to the measure. I can assure the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs that that is consistent with EU law, and that we have struck the right balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We raised the same point on 4 November in relation to clause 108, namely that the decision notice should not have effect until the period for referral to the tribunal had expired. The Minister agreed that that was intended, and that the Government would table amendments to clause 108 to that effect. Indeed, at the time, he discussed the subject at much greater length. The same issues relating to notice apply here. Will the Minister confirm that, when the Government table the amendments to clause 108 on Report, as promised, they will also look at clause 167?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments correct an oversight in the Bill. The draft Bill published in July 1998 contained a power for the FSA to impose what was termed a "listed activity prohibition". That power was never satisfactory. It permitted the FSA to stop all an EEA firm's activities in the United Kingdom, or to stop none at all. That was not what was intended and the powers have been redrafted to work properly, and to permit the authority to take the action proportionate to the problem. We therefore dropped
	<span class='label label-info column'>960</span>
the power before the Bill was introduced. Unfortunately, however, at that stage we did not entirely eliminate its lingering ghostly presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to probe the operation of the Bill as a whole in relation to contraventions by those who carry on business from outside the United Kingdom and probably from outside the EU or EEA. The clause ties in with clause 120, which provides an opportunity for a citizen to bring an action for damages in relation to contravention of a rule by an authorised person. Clause 173 goes wider and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a person contravenes a requirement imposed on him by the Authority in the exercise of its power of intervention, section 120 applies to the contravention as it applies to a contravention mentioned in that section."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
How does that apply to someone who is not an authorised person? It is all very well to have a system whereby authorised persons who transgress must pay damages but what will be the position of a business operating from the Cayman Islands that does business with someone in this country who perceives that he has suffered loss and damage and wants to sue for it? I anticipate that it will be possible to bring an action here and, if it can be established that someone has carried on business in breach of the requirements of the Bill, there will be a cause of action. Judgment could then be obtained against the business and enforced by such international means as exist. The business in the Cayman Islands would not be able to get off scot free. How does that tie in with an action for damages under clause 173?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes a contravention of a requirement imposed in the exercise of the intervention power actionable by third parties in the same way as the contravention of a rule under part IX. The powers of intervention under this part do not apply to persons who are not authorised by virtue of schedule 3 or schedule 4. The Cayman Islands firm—I probably said as much as I could about the position of Cayman Islands firms in an earlier exchange—would therefore not be covered. There is an inconsistency between that and what is provided in relation to firms authorised under part IV. Under clause 18(2), there will be no right of action for a permission breached under part IV. We are considering how best to resolve the inconsistency, and, therefore, whether the provision should be retained in this part. The matter will be revisited on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary was good enough to say that he had not really answered my question. However, our discussion has underlined the fact that we are setting up an extremely elaborate and, to some extent, expensive system—necessarily so—for the goodies. The Bill will do nothing to assist the citizen who finds that he is contracted with a baddie. If a firm is authorised, a citizen will have effective means of address. It would be helpful to know what means of redress are available—I think that such means exist—if business has been transacted with an unauthorised firm. That problem may be more real than it seems—I suspect that those who mean to do business will not say that they are not authorised. I suspect that some firms on the internet will say that they are authorised by a local authorising body, which will probably sound convincing. If a citizen were told that a company was authorised by the PIA, he would probably regard that as valuable, which it is. The Personal Investment Authority has a great deal of power and, I hope, executes effective regulation. If a citizen were told that a company were authorised by the FIA, the QTA or the WIA, however, he would probably not know any better; indeed, he would probably be comforted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been crawling over these matters in immense detail for about 14 weeks. Will the Financial Secretary make a brief comment on how such provisions relate to the real world and the protection of the citizen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>962</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman would probably join me in urging customers of financial services firms to ensure that they are dealing with an authorised firm. The fact that only one set of initials will be used, instead of the profusion in the past, is helpful. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out, FSA rules apply only to authorised persons. We do not envisage that the right of damages will accrue against a non-authorised person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We envisage that there will be a course of action against a non-authorised person, which will sound in damages. Will the Financial Secretary explain how that will work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point that I was coming to. The fact that action cannot be taken under the Bill does not mean that action cannot be taken by other means. If there is another course of action in negligence or breach of contract against a non-authorised person, it can be exercised in the normal way. That is the available recourse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a more to it than that, which is what I wanted the Minister to bring out. When a regulatory system is set up which people avoid, the system is not just left with the right of action in negligence; the fact that those people will be found by a court to have been carrying on business in this country will give rise to actions based on their failure to become authorised that are much more powerful than negligence actions. If it was only a negligence action they might well not have been negligent. They might be running an efficient business. I am trying to put what we are doing with this Bill into the wider context of the void that surrounds it. I am trying to tease out from the Minister the fact that citizens will not be left without a remedy if people come to do business here. I find that I am giving the answers and I would prefer to ask the questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his helpful answers. Someone who wrongly claims to be authorised will commit an offence under clause 22. There are limits to what can be achieved for people who contract with wrongdoers abroad, but the criminal offences of carrying on unauthorised regulated business and illegal financial promotion, alongside the unenforceability provisions, are quite a powerful deterrent. I think that they will be quite effective. Enforcing the offences is a matter of ensuring that we have effective international co-operation. If we do not have that, our position is much weaker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA, unlike its predecessors, will also have an objective of improving consumer awareness and making sure that people are aware of the possible hazards of taking out business with people with whom it is not sensible to take out business. I cannot go much further but I hope that I have given some of the reassurances that the right hon. and learned Gentleman was hoping to elicit from me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the fact that someone from, say, the Cayman Islands carries on a financial services business in this country without being authorised of itself give rise to a right of action so

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 633, in page 89, line 7, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) The Authority may not in respect of any contravention of a statement of principles or code of practice with respect to the conduct expected of an authorised person require a person to pay a penalty under this section.'.</p></blockquote>
We have now come to part XIII on disciplinary measures. In essence, the authority is empowered, when it considers that someone has contravened a rule, code or principle, either to publish a statement and name and shame or, as the clause provides, to levy fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is partly probing but deals with a controversial issue within the industry. The FSA can levy fines that it considers appropriate and substantial fines were sometimes levied by the FSA's predecessor bodies for breaches of principle rather than for breaches of detailed rules. Paragraph 14 of the FSA's paper of July 1999 set out its response on consultation powers and enforcing the new regime. It mentioned, without commenting much about it, that several complaints had been made about the arbitrary practice of imposing fines for breaches of principle rather than specific breaches of rules. In enunciating its 11 principles, the FSA made it clear that it considered them to be as effective as specific and prescribed rules and that its intention was to continue to censure or levy large fines as it saw fit in response to breaches of principle. The intellectual problem arises because the principles are widely drawn and some argue that the FSA has too much discretion to interpret the principles and levy fines at will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government make their intentions regarding clause 177 clear? The amendment would make it clear that the FSA could not impose a fine when the offence is a breach of a principle or code: de facto fines should relate to specific rule breaches. The matter is less than clear. It is an issue of major controversy within the industry and is particularly objected to by foreign firms that come into this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>964</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will attempt to provide the clarification for which the hon. Gentleman asked: I appreciate that it is primarily a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only place in the Bill where statements of principle or codes of practice are provided for is part V, which applies to approved rather than authorised persons. Part VII provides for the market abuse code, but financial penalties for market abuse are provided for under that part, not here. In addition, a penalty under part VII is for committing market abuse as defined in clause 95, rather than for a breach of the code as such. The statements of principle and codes of conduct about which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs expressed concern must therefore be the FSA's principles for business, but those principles in the terminology of the Bill are not "statements of principle", but "rules" under part X, albeit rules set at a high level of generality. People could be disciplined for a breach of them in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA set out its intentions on the enforcement of principles in its feedback statement on consultation paper 17, which is reiterated in its response to consultation paper 13 on the FSA principles. Consultation paper 17 on the response states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would expect most cases to involve breaches of rules,"</p></blockquote>
by which the FSA means detailed rules. However, the paper also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There may be some cases where it is appropriate to discipline on basis of the Principles alone."</p></blockquote>
It is anticipated that the FSA's ability to take action for breach of rules—even high level rules like the principles of business—will be rarely used. However, it would not be sensible to remove that ability, as suggested by the amendment.

Detailed rules will never cover every eventuality, especially in markets in which there is a lot of innovation. The conduct of an authorised person. who breaches a high-level rule in a way that is not foreseen in more detailed rules may, nevertheless, harm the interests of consumers. It is clearly right that the regulator should be able to take appropriate action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without that option, the FSA would inevitably draw up bulkier and more detailed rule books, in the interest of protecting consumers. A more highly prescriptive regime would serve to increase costs and deter business, which none of us want. The Joint Committee chaired by Lord Burns considered that issue at considerable length, weighing the desire for certainty about what conduct is permitted against the need to avoid over-prescription. It concluded that strengthening the role of guidance was a better way to meet legitimate demand for greater certainty than writing more rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure Committee members that the FSA's principles for business will be elaborated by a body of rules, evidential provisions and guidance. The FSA made clear in its response to consultation paper 17 the importance of ensuring that the application of the principles of business is predictable. All of us want that to happen. On the basis of those arguments, I trust that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied and will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is entirely right, especially in relation to the FSA making rules for the independent financial adviser sector. The FSA will destroy that sector if it makes hugely prescriptive rules, and will soon be referred to the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission. There is a grave danger that that will happen, so the rules for small independent financial advisers need to be in the nature of the 10 Commandments. The disadvantage of such rules is that the FSA must have power to interpret them and to discipline according to that interpretation. One cannot have it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been widespread criticism in the institutional marketplace. Institutional businesses can afford to handle prescriptive rules, in cases in which they want them. However, there has been random, unprofessional application of fining for breaches of principles, and citation of specific rules. The FSA acknowledged that problem in the response published in July, but did not say how it would address it. The clause leaves the FSA with power to continue to fine at random for breaches of principle as defined. The position is not entirely satisfactory in relation to operative matters, and the Treasury must sort it out with the FSA. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to amendments with which I think the Government will have no difficulty, because they have already given ground in earlier discussions dealing with warning and decision notices and referrals to tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with notice for payments. Amendment No. 635 spills over into clause 181, which deals with publications of censure against people being prosecuted by the FSA. The principle at stake is that the authority should not be able to fine or to name and shame a body or person while a decision by the FSA and its tribunal procedure is still open to review. The notes on clauses for clause 180 state that the procedure for notice of payment of fines should be undertaken only once the authority has
	<span class='label label-info column'>966</span>
completed the procedure under clause 339. Clause 339 clearly sets out circumstances in which the decision notice procedure should occur and, in subsection (7), the circumstances in which a decision remains open to review: when the period in which a matter may be referred to the tribunal is still running; when a matter has already been referred to the tribunal but it has not got round to dealing with it; when an appeal period is still running, and when the findings of an appeal have not yet been determined. There is a discrepancy in clause 180 in that it does not require that the terms under clause 339(7) be satisfied before the details of the penalty are imposed or the bailiffs sent in. Clause 180(3) states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The specified period may not be less than 14 days".</p></blockquote>
It would be anomalous to specify any period of time when there is no time cap on a final decision from the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 319 provides for the addition to subsection(2)(b) that the notice for payment should not proceed if appeal has been made to the tribunal. Amendment No. 634 is consequential to that, adding to subsection (4) the provision that bailiffs cannot be sent in to seize an unpaid fine or goods to the value of the fine before an appeal procedure has been completed. The same principle applies to the power of censure under clause 181.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the appeal and tribunal processes are to be effective, fair and meaningful, an investigated person should surely not have the penalties of that prosecution executed when the FSA has been tardy or failed to get its act together under the appeals procedure. The amendments enhance the clause by making clearer those safeguards already specified under clause 339, to which we shall come later. I hope that the Government will agree to the amendments, because they have already conceded that ground in earlier discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is likely that we shall have to make changes to this clause to achieve the effect of that amendment and to ensure consistency. The changes must also be compatible with the revised approach taken in clause 108. We must also ensure that the amendments allow a reference to be made to the tribunal rather than to an appeal—again, remembering that it is a first instance tribunal. I hope that the hon.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 182 has the same effect as clause 67 in part VI and clause 99 in part VII, both of which we have already debated. It requires the FSA to publish a statement about its policy on penalties: the statement must cover policy both on the circumstances in which it would seek to impose a penalty, and on the amount of any penalty. It is an important provision, ensuring a high degree of transparency in respect of the policy by which the FSA will impose penalties. It will give people a clear idea of what they can expect if
	<span class='label label-info column'>968</span>
they engage in misconduct and malpractice. To ensure that proper standards of conduct are met, it is important that the consequences of a failure to meet those standards are highly visible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA set out its initial thoughts on the matter in its consultation paper No. 17, "Enforcing the New Regime", which was published in December 1998. The feedback on that consultation was published in July 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 631 implements a recommendation of the Joint Committee. In paragraph 18 of its second report, the Committee recommended that the Bill should require that, in setting the amount of any fine, regard should be given to the mischief achieved or intended and to whether the offender was an individual or a firm. We have already made changes to clause 99 to give effect to that recommendation in part VII. Amendment No. 631 does the same for part XIII.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 632 would add a new subsection (7). It begins with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In exercising, or deciding whether to exercise, its power under section 177".</p></blockquote>
That will make it clearer that the FSA must consider the statement of policy in deciding whether to impose a penalty and, if it decides to do so, how much it should be. The amendment will bring the clause in line with clause 99(5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 636, 637 and 638, tabled by the Opposition, deal with the requirement for the FSA to consult on and publicise the statement, although amendment No. 637 would delete the requirement to consult. Amendment No. 639 would give the Treasury the power to direct the FSA to modify the statement of policy if it considered that the policy, or any part of it, were contrary to the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sympathy with much of the thinking behind the amendments. I confirm that we shall further change the clause, and clauses 67 and 99, to provide for policy statements about financial penalties. I hope that that will be of comfort to Opposition Members, but of course, I shall be happy to respond to any further point that they want to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are coming to the close of this sitting on an amiable note. We are pleased that the Government are implementing the Joint Committee's recommendations under amendments Nos. 631 and 632. I have it on reliable authority that the Opposition agreed to the carry-over on the basis that the Government would implement the Joint Committee's recommendations. I hope that they will implement several other recommendations. Of course, we are entirely happy with the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendments Nos. 636, 637 and 638, which interrelate, we propose that the policy on penalties should be published so that everyone knows about it. The Financial Secretary is correct in that the amendment's drafting is slightly wrong, but what is meant is that the FSA should be obliged to consult and that it should state that any representation must be made to it in a specified time. Under amendment No. 638, we propose that the FSA must have regard to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>969</span>
representations made before it publishes that material. We have dealt with analogous matters previously, and I am pleased that the Government broadly agree with the thrust of what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 639 is a probing amendment. The FSA must give a copy of the report to the Treasury, but strangely, the Treasury has no power to step in and tell the FSA that it has gone too far and must be stopped in the public interest. If the Financial Secretary has anything specific to say about that, I should be happy to hear it in the next minute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
