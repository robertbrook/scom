	<p>9 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning everybody. Some hon. Members have asked whether they may remove their jackets and I have said that they can. I call the Minister to move the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Children (Leaving Care) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I was pleased to learn that you would be chairing our Committee, Mrs. Michie. This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of serving on a Standing Committee under your leadership, and I am sure that I speak for everyone when I say that we are all looking forward to receiving the support and stewardship that you will, no doubt, provide in abundance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will be possible to make swift progress on the Bill. As all hon. Members will be aware, the Bill is a short one, having only eight clauses; nevertheless, it is an important measure that will make significant and far-reaching changes to the procedures regulating children in care and the manner in which they leave the care of local authorities. The problems of the existing arrangement are well documented: it is failing far too many children in the care system. We have a responsibility to put that right as quickly as possible, which is why we introduced the Bill and why I am pleased that it has attracted strong support both inside and outside Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will be making historic changes that are long overdue. I hope that the Committee is able to proceed as quickly as we would like and that the spirit of consensus that has been the hallmark of debates on the Bill so far will continue to prevail throughout our sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my voice to the Minister's comments: I, too, look forward to your stewardship of what I confidently expect to be brief and constructive consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is primarily designed to improve and strengthen child protection. Although its ambitions were widened somewhat during its passage through the House of Lords, at its heart is the protection of vulnerable children. I am delighted to hear the Minister concur with something that I have said many times before, which is that that is an objective that enjoys the wholehearted support of hon. Members of all parties. There is a long history of co-operation on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Conservative Members certainly intend to approach the Bill on the basis of consensus on the principles; I hope that the Committee's deliberations will reflect that spirit. On Second Reading, the Minister and the great majority of other hon. Members who spoke, including myself, approached the Bill in that spirit and a broad consensus prevailed, however, one or two jarring notes were injected into those proceedings: for example, the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) takes a less laid-back view of the issues than others do. I am disappointed that he is not present this morning, although I am sure that he will play an active role on the Committee. He is strongly interested in issues involving children and I know that his intentions are good, but his occasionally intemperate approach is unlikely to deliver the effective results that the rest of us want to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who regard the continuous steady strengthening of the safeguards and protection for children as a cross-party issue also see it as a long-term process. Governments come and go and different parties enter and leave office, but I hope that, on this if on no other issue, the mood of co-operation and cross-party consensus will continue in the decades ahead. I hope that any hon. Members who are tempted to try to make party political capital from the Bill will resist that temptation in the interests of strengthening and maintaining the consensus that has prevailed, not only in respect of the Bill before us, but on the Protection of Children Act 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standing Committees come into their own when they consider Bills whose principles are agreed and on which there are no party political divides. Members of the Committee can examine the issues and address matters of detail. The Minister does not fall into the trap of doing so, but I know that it is tempting for Labour Members to behave as though legislation as drafted has to be defended and protected. The Bill should not be approached in that manner if our proceedings are to be constructive; we should look for ways to strengthen and improve it, so that its purpose and effects are durable. I hope that the Minister concedes that the Standing Committee's constructive consideration and criticism of last year's Protection of Children Act—a private Member's Bill in whose preparation the Department of Health had a hand—led to substantial changes being made that strengthened it significantly. In short, if a Bill's principles are the subject of consensus, instead of being part of the party political process with which we are all familiar, a Standing Committee becomes a genuine part of the evolution and development of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a good one, but it is not perfect. We flagged up several points of concern on Second Reading; I do not intend to go over them now, as we shall have plenty of opportunity to do that in our coming sittings. I expect that, in many cases, Ministers will have considered the issues raised on Second Reading and that they will be able to reassure us—perhaps not by making changes to the Bill, but by giving assurances regarding the regulations and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
directions that will implement it. In that way, we shall be able to feel that our concerns have been considered and addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other, slightly more meaty issues, such as the human rights implications of the Bill in respect of adults—people aged over 18—covered by it. It will be necessary for the Committee to explore those issues in detail, not only because of the substantive points they raise, but because of the need to ensure that the legislation is durable and not vulnerable to judicial reinterpretation along unintended lines. I am sure that Ministers have received advice and that they will share some of that advice with the Committee, but, as many holders of the office of Home Secretary have discovered, the best advice can turn out to be inadequate when legislation affecting human rights comes to the attention of the courts and is reinterpreted by them. We must be sure that there is no danger of the intentions behind the Bill falling foul of judicial reinterpretation and that there will be no unintended or inadvertent infringement of the rights of adults by a Bill that is designed to strengthen the protection of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will approach its deliberations constructively, that it will get on with the work in hand and that it will make a positive contribution to the armoury of child protection legislation that we in this country are gradually—and, I believe, sensibly—building up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am pleased that you are chairing the Committee, Mrs. Michie. What a good thing it is that we face a different Chairman, given that Standing Committee A looks more like permanent Committee A, but you might have to remind us occasionally that we are dealing with a new Bill, not with the one that we have been considering for the past six weeks. On a similar note, I should like to say how welcome I find the presence of the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre on the Committee. I find his contributions to our debates extremely valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not take up the Committee's time at this stage. I want the Bill to be passed, although I should prefer it to be more child and young-person-centred in its presentation. That might be a matter of detail and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
style, but there are one or two other issues, such as benefits payment and the responsibilities of local authorities, that need to be explored in depth when we get to them. For now, I shall say only that I strongly support the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chatham and Aylesford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be a member of the Committee and to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie. We look forward to your guiding us through a Bill that, although short, will produce benefits that are long felt by young people throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For too long, young people, often from the most horrendous background, have left care at an inappropriate age—16 or 17. The average age at which a well-adjusted child from what we regard as an average background leaves home is 22 or 23, and that age is creeping upwards. The Bill will enable young people to remain in care until the age of 21—and, if they are in training or education, 24—which is most welcome. I am sure that all the Committee wishes my hon. Friend the Minister the best in his negotiations with the Treasury on the comprehensive spending review, so that he can secure much-needed resources for the group of young people with whom the Bill deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmly welcome the Bill. In my previous job, I sat in on too many meetings and saw too many young people who had been ill-prepared for the outside world. I am sure that the Bill will make all the difference to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Children (Leaving Care) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution connected with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
