	<div class='title'>FURTHER DUTIES OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TOWARDS CHILDREN WHOM THEY ARE LOOKING AFTER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 3, in page 2, line 14, after '19C, insert '(1)'.—[	<i>Mr. Hammond.</i>]</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 16, after 'adviser', add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The Secretary of State may be regulations make provision as to persons or classes of persons who are
	<ol>
	<li>fit to be personal advisers; and</li>
	<li>not fit to be personal advisers.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister's comments, but I still have some concerns. I do not for one minute doubt that he is well intentioned—I am sure that he has as great a desire as other Committee members have to avoid adverse consequences. We are simply discussing the best way to realise those intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about a responsible local authority employing those who are personal advisers. Does that imply that the work will be full time? I suspect not, although they will probably be remunerated in one form or another, in which case the term "employ" may therefore be correct. He also said that the Protection of Children Act 1999 would ensure that inappropriate people—the 1999 Act makes it clear who is inappropriate—would not be eligible for employment in such positions. I do not have a copy of the 1999 Act to hand, but I cannot recall a provision relating to those who are over 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point—we need to find a solution to the problem and ensure that the relevant legislation applies. That might involve the definition of a child care position and the guidance we issue to local authorities on who can be employed in such positions. My guess is that young persons' advisers could be regarded as occupying child care positions; that is a route through which the POCA provisions could apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that. The way in which POCA was framed meant that Ministers' ability to give guidance to social services providers was crucial to that Act's operation.
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
I suspect that the Minister's solution—allowing the definition of a child care position to include a personal adviser to a young person aged up to 24—might fall foul of the sensitivities regarding the use of language that were expressed this morning by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand), but I accept that the Minister is exploring the correct technical way in which to achieve the desired end. I emphasise once again that we are not at odds—there is no issue of principle at stake. We are exploring ways in which to ensure that the right people do the job—we all understand what is meant by the right sort of people. If should not be possible for different authorities in various parts of the country to use different interpretations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I ask leave to withdraw the amendment, I should point out that we intend to probe the matter further on Report. Many Opposition Members—and, I suspect, many Labour Members—regard personal advisers as a crucial element of the Government's overall policy. We should involve the right people with the right background. The Minister knows that we believe that voluntary organisations should play a significant role: volunteers, who might be paid, rather than full-time professionals, should work in that position. We shall explore the matter further on Report, once we have had a chance to reflect on what the Minister has said today. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN, 	<i>being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of the debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders Nos. 68 and 89,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN CHILDREN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 3, line 12, after 'each', insert 'responsible'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is both technical and probing, and I realise that the Minister might be able to draw our attention to the fact that the issue that it raises is dealt with elsewhere. Subsections (2) and (3) of proposed new section 23B refer to "each local authority", but not to a responsible local authority: those are the terms used in the Bill to define the local authority responsible for any given child—that is, the authority that last looked after the child. In new section 23B(1), the definition of the authority is qualified further. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>It is the duty of each local authority to take reasonable steps to keep in touch with a relevant child for whom they are the responsible authority.</p></blockquote>
The concept of the responsible authority is brought into that subsection, but not into subsections (2) and (3), to which the amendment refers. Those subsections refer only to the
	<br><blockquote><p>duty of each local authority</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
in relation to any relevant child. That does not appear to encompass the concept of a local authority in relation to
	<br><blockquote><p>a relevant child for whom they are the responsible authority.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would make it clear that "each local authority" means "each responsible local authority". Otherwise, we could face the slightly absurd consequence whereby literally each local authority had that duty placed on it by subsections (2) and (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious, as I listen to myself explaining this, that perhaps I might not be making myself clear. However, I think that the Minister understands the point that I am making. He may have a simple answer, and I look forward to hearing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman genteelly described this as a technical amendment. It is the sort of amendment that we increasingly associate with him, but I accept that he is motivated by a desire to ensure that the Bill is correctly drafted and I shall try to put his mind at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that the Bill defines a responsible authority in proposed new section 23A(4) as
	<br><blockquote><p>the one which last looked after the</p></blockquote>
relevant child. New section 23B(1) sets out in full the relationship between the relevant child and the responsible authority. However, from new section 23B(2) onwards, the drafting is more compact and does not repeat the phrase "the responsible authority" each time a new duty is set out. That was the point about which the hon. Gentleman has expressed concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having looked carefully at the provisions, I do not believe that there is any ambiguity in the drafting. I draw to the hon. Gentleman's attention the to heading given to new section 23B:
	<br><blockquote><p>Additional functions of the responsible authority in respect of relevant children.</p></blockquote>
That makes it clear that the new section deals with the same subject. No council or court could be in any doubt about the interpretation of that part of the Bill. I am happy to state for the record that the local authority to which reference is made throughout new section 23B is the responsible authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explicit clarification. Will he confirm, for my benefit, the legal status of clause or section headings to a Bill or Act of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand them to be general guides to interpretation that provide clarity as to the purpose and function of the clause or section. Clause headings are not, technically speaking, part of a Bill—it is a curious and quaint aspect of the way in which we make law in this country—but they are consulted by the courts when resolving issues such as this. The meaning of new section 23B is perfectly clear to us: the local authority to which it refers is the responsible authority.
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for seeking to clarify the point, because without such clarification this part of the Bill might not make a great deal of sense. I hope that I have reassured him about our intentions and about our interpretation of this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful clarification. If new subsections (2) and (3) had referred to the duty of "the local authority", the reference back to subsection (1) would have been clear and unambiguous, but I found a degree of ambiguity in their references to the duty of "each local authority". Although I am all in favour of compactness in drafting, the insertion of the word "responsible" in two additional places would not have been terribly onerous, nor would it have had much impact on the length of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that the issue has been raised and the Minister has clearly stated the Government's intention for the record. It is for him to decide how it should best be implemented. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 3, line 20, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is admirably direct in its use of language in respect of placing duties on local authorities, so I was surprised to see that a "may" has crept in place of the usual "shall". Will the Minister explain why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could answer that for the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, but it might be better if I do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have many debates in Standing Committee about the words "may", "shall", "will", "can", "ought to" and so on. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question turns on a simple issue of common sense. On many occasions, it will be sensible to have assessments carried out at the same time, but it would not be sensible to make it compulsory for them to happen together in all cases. Some young people are likely to have multiple problems and will need help from various specialists for different aspects of their care. In addition, needs may change without warning—for example, a health problem may develop. It would not be sensible to delay an assessment for one special need because another specialist in a totally unrelated field was unavailable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is required is a common-sense approach, not a legislative bludgeon. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's amendment is entirely well intentioned, but it could be counter-productive, delaying assessments if they could not all be carried out at the same time. It is in councils' interests, as well as those of young people, to streamline the assessment process as much as possible, but they should not be forced to do so when it would not be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman. We do not depart fundamentally from his point about joining up the assessment process. However, his amendment could cause more problems than it would solve, and that is not what we are here to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of my amendment was purely exploratory, to allow the Minister to demonstrate his grasp of the fine detail of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 4, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(14) The Secretary of State shall by regulations make provision as to what constitutes "reasonable steps" in relation to the obligations of responsible local authorities and what constitutes "lost touch with a relevant child" under this section and section 23C.</p></blockquote>
Our consideration of the Bill has a certain predictability, in that debates that we have already had flag up the points of substance on which there are differing views and which members of the Committee want to debate. The amendment addresses one such point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would place the Secretary of State under an obligation to make regulations setting out what constitutes the "reasonable steps" that a local authority will be required to take to get back in touch with a relevant child or former relevant child with whom they have lost contact. Such regulations would also state the meaning of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>lost touch with a relevant child.</p></blockquote>
There is an error in the amendment that appears on the amendment paper: for the grammar to be correct, it should read, "and what constitutes having 'lost touch with a relevant child'". I shall assume that the error lies in my drafting, although it might just be a misprint. However, it does not change the substance of the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need clarity regarding the intentions behind the obligation placed on local authorities to get in touch with adults who have left care with whom they have lost touch. As all hon. Members who took part in the debate on Second Reading will know, that issue is important to our debate on the rights of an adult to lose contact with the sponsoring authority if he so wishes. Before we have that debate, we need to know precisely what will be required of a local authority in discharging its obligations to making contact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I spoke in deliberately extreme terms about tracking down people who had escaped from contact with the local authority. To put our discussion into context, I said that we would not have the consensus that we do if we did not all accept that, in the vast majority of cases, young people will welcome contact and the support that it brings as part of a positive process to help them to make the transition from care to the outside world. However, I flagged up the fact that the Bill, as originally conceived, dealt primarily with children aged 16 and 17 and that its scope has been expanded since then. We are now
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
considering two different things, one of which is the duty to keep in contact with children for whom the local authority is the corporate parent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hilton Dawson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lancaster and Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When researching this part of the Bill, did the hon. Gentleman come across a single example of a young person who is currently in care or who has left care objecting to the idea that local authorities should have such a role?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not the issue. There are two points of substance, the first of which is the question of whether individuals who are adults have the right to opt out of a system that is tracking and monitoring them. That is a matter of principle. However, a practical question arises from the implications of the Human Rights Act 1998 and whether there is a risk that the provisions of the Bill that apply to adults will fall foul of that Act. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me—and to avoid trying your patience, Mrs Michie—I do not believe it is sensible at this stage to discuss the principle of adults who are former relevant children being allowed to opt out of the process. There will be adequate opportunity to discuss that when we come to amendment No. 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our probing amendment is to ascertain both what is understood by a local authority taking "reasonable steps" to get back in touch with a former relevant child with whom it has lost touch, and what "lost touch" means. Much will hinge on that. There is no argument in the case of a child: no one would say that a local authority should not be required to take reasonable steps to get back in touch with a child for whom it is responsible and who has gone missing. Indeed, it might be thought that reasonable steps are not enough in the case of a child aged 16 or 17. I suspect that a parent who had lost touch with a child of that age and did not know where that child was would call the police and try to persuade them that a wholesale missing person inquiry should be undertaken. There is no question that a responsible local authority which acts as a corporate parent to a child should take every possible step to find the child, re-establish contact and ensure that it is not in danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, former relevant children who are adults raise different issues. On Second Reading, I referred to "assertive outreach". Former relevant children may leave their home area, perhaps at the age of 18 or even later, to make a clean break with their previous life, which may have been unhappy. They might move to London or another big city, seeking a life style that their former corporate parent might not approve of or think suitable. However, they are adults. Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is to discover what the Minister would require a local authority to do in such a case to discharge its duty to take reasonable steps to get in touch with an adult who has gone away. Would it be a reasonable step for the local authority to involve the police, and would the police want to become involved or be able to do so? If not, what resources could the local authority use to discharge its duty? The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) is smiling as if he has some suggestions; perhaps he will tell us what they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the local authority have access to sources of information that are not available to other citizens? Will it have access to information that a former relevant child, now an adult, might reasonably regard as confidential? How else can a local authority track down and re-establish contact with a former relevant child who is avoiding that? If a former relevant child has got out of touch with the local authority simply through accident or hazard, the big issue to which I am speaking will not arise. However, I can foresee circumstances in which former relevant children want to remove themselves from contact with their former corporate parent. It is not for us to debate how often that might occur, or whether it is a reasonable approach for a former relevant child to take. The fact is, that that person will be an adult and so entitled to privacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever is set out later in the Bill, there will be an absolute obligation on local authorities to take reasonable steps to get back in touch with such a child. If "reasonable steps" means placing an advertisement in the newspaper asking to hear from Fred Bloggs, no issue arises. The other extreme that I suggested on Second Reading is that a local authority might be obliged to hire a private detective agency to track down a person who had left the local authority area and gone to London. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre seems to find that amusing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is completely absurd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could explain why it is so absurd. An absolute duty is placed on a local authority to take reasonable steps, which I take to be those that have a reasonable chance of succeeding. However, I am not a lawyer; the Minister is, so perhaps he can explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chatham and Aylesford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that the general public would think it reasonable for a cash-strapped local authority to hire a private detective agency to track down an adult?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in learning the Minister's view of what constitutes reasonable action. The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting distinction between the case of a child and that of an adult, but the Bill places the same obligation on a local authority in both cases. If there was a suggestion that a child was in danger, might it not be reasonable to take extreme measures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the test what an ordinary parent would do? I have children who are beyond infancy. In the proper circumstances, I might not resort to a sniffer dog, but I would certainly put an advert in the paper and do other things that might achieve my objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me tell the hon. Gentleman what he would do as a reasonable parent, which is another reason why I am not persuaded by what Labour Members are saying. A reasonable parent, worried about an 18-year-old child who ha gone to London—perhaps to live in an area that the parent does not like with people he does not much care for—would jump in his car or get on the train and go to London to have a look. The corporate parent does not have that option: by definition it is a body corporate, not a parent who can jump in a car. Therefore, if it wants what an ordinary parent might want, it will have to hire someone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre may think it absurd, but a local authority in Sunderland, to take an area at random, might find that the most economic way in which to do what the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) would do as a natural parent is to hire someone who specialises in tracking down missing persons. The problem arises because the corporate parent does not have the personal resources of a natural parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite prepared to concede that I might be barking up the wrong tree here. The Minister may provide the Committee with an interpretation of the term "reasonable steps" that sets our mind at rest—one that is not nearly as intrusive as we fear. The amendment was tabled to invite the Minister to define both "in touch" with a relevant child or a former relevant child and "reasonable steps" taken to get back in touch with the relevant children. We should now stop speculating and invite the Minister to put us out of our misery by telling us precisely what he envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment allows an interesting exploration of the Bill's purpose. In a later amendment I shall speak about young people who have decided to get lost and do not want to be found. But it is important that we make matters as easy as possible for those who wish to be found. Can the Minister envisage some collective arrangement among local authorities for, say, a help line or contact telephone, which could, for example, be advertised in 	<i>The Big Issue</i> in areas where young people who are at risk are likely to be seen? That would remind them that there is someone whom they can fall back on. Much of that excellent work is done through the Salvation Army and other voluntary organisations. I had hoped that the authorities could take a collective view, because it will be difficult for isolated single local authorities to carry out that task on a nationwide basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) fully understood his amendment, in the context of which he spoke a great deal about "former relevant children". His amendment relates to relevant children, not former relevant children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment contains the words "under this section and section 23C". I understand that the latter deals with former relevant children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to keep a sense of proportion and balance about all this. At one point, the hon. Gentleman teetered on the brink of imagining that the Bill was setting up the architecture of a new police state. We are doing nothing sinister, nor talking of surveillance in the sense that the hon. Gentleman had in mind. The provision is intended to be a supportive, helpful tool for local authorities and young people. We do not envisage the hiring of private detectives or any of the other arrangements that the hon. Gentleman referred to. We are giving local authorities the important responsibility of keeping in touch, and we fully intend to help them discharge that important new duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple issue to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention is, how do we do that? Will we do it by regulation, as he invites us to, or by some other means? The same set of issues arises here as in the context of an amendment that we debated this morning. The hon. Gentleman raised pertinent examples of the type of situations that might have to be covered. There will be a wide variety of circumstances where keeping in touch can mean different things, depending on each case. We might be talking of difficult children for whom the duty to keep in touch could involve daily and regular contact; for other children, contact might be periodic, depending on the circumstances of the case being dealt with by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The person doing the work will be the young person's adviser. The hon. Gentleman imagines that, because the local authority is the corporate parent, there would be no one to try physically to discharge the responsibility of keeping in touch, but that is not true. The young person's adviser will be the principal conduit through which the local authority will undertake its statutory responsibility. It will be down to the young person's adviser to establish a proper set of arrangements for keeping in touch and for taking what will constitute reasonable steps to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister takes us back to a previous debate during which he did not give a satisfactory answer to our questions. As I understand the role of the young persons' advisers, in practical terms they will not be able to disappear from their patch, perhaps for days, to try to remake contact with the child, because they will have obligations to other young people, whom they cannot abandon. Does the Minister agree that the advisers are unlikely to be able to pursue one of their charges to the other end of the country, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, he has asked me another impossible question. It is perfectly conceivable that a young person leaving care will have a young person's adviser who is responsible for only one child, because that is the decision that the local authority and the young person have taken. In such circumstances, it is therefore possible that the young person's adviser might do what the hon. Gentleman suggested. However, it is also conceivable that, having moved to another area, the young person may make contact
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
with the local authority and the contact will be re-established without the need for the adviser to trundle up and down the west coast main line for days trying to discover the child's whereabouts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sensible solutions to problems can be found. The hon. Gentleman is asking me to spell out in detail what reasonable steps and contact there would be, but regulations are not appropriate in view of our earlier discussions. If we were to attempt to construct regulations to encompass the scenario that he describes of the young person who wants to avoid contact with the local authority, to specify what "reasonable steps" to keep in touch might be and to tie them to an infinite range of possible circumstances in the real world, the regulations would become very interesting. I would certainly want to see them before I asked anyone else to approve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be alert to the practicalities of the matter and say, honestly, "Yes, there will be some difficult calls and difficult judgments to make about what is reasonable contact and what a reasonable local authority should do." But as I said earlier, the best way to do so would be in the context of statutory guidance in section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 because, as a tool, guidance gives us greater flexibility and more opportunity to help local authorities to discharge their new and important responsibilities as the hon. Gentleman wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to duck out of the debate; I am telling the hon. Gentleman that there is an almost infinite range of young people's circumstances; some will have successful relationships with their local authority, and keeping in touch will be straightforward and predictable; others will face complex issues, and the young person's adviser will be central to resolving those problems. However, the best way to furnish advice to local authorities on discharging their duties is in the practical context of statutory guidance, which will allow us to go into greater depth in responding to some of the issues raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cited two extremes, which could be characterised as situations in which the young person voluntarily keeps in contact and those in which the young person is kept in contact on an involuntary basis. Is not that the important defining feature? No one has any problem with young people voluntarily keeping in touch with the local authority; the anxiety is about people who do not keep in touch with the local authority. What steps will the local authority have to take to pursue them in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the only distinction between cases; for example, a young person who gets into difficulty may have drug or alcohol problems and disappear for a time. He might nevertheless welcome contact from the local authority. The person might lose touch with the young person's adviser, not as a conscious act of defiance, but simply because of his life style choices. We need to be alert to that and ensure that the guidance provides constructive and practical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
help for local authorities as they wrestle with the difficult judgment calls that they need to make. The hon. Gentleman is right to that extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little unclear about one aspect of the hon. Gentleman's amendment and the way in which he constructed his argument. I got the impression that he felt that the new duty to keep in touch was obtrusive, intrusive and therefore needed to be watered down. I think that he implied that we should make regulations. That is a surprising argument. I may have paraphrased it and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong. My understanding is that Lord Howe took the view in the other place that the duty to keep in touch was, if anything, not strong enough, not that it was too strong. He felt that the duty needed to be strengthened to maintain the bond between the young person and the local authority. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman's position is entirely consistent with the constructive view taken by Lord Howe. I am sure that there is an explanation and that we shall hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is one of simple practicality. There is no dispute between us about how we resolve the issues; the question is simply where we resolve them. Do we deal with the matters in regulations, with all the limitations that, by definition, accompany a statutory instrument, or do we deal with them in the more flexible context of statutory guidance? I have made it clear that the hon. Gentleman is welcome to participate in the process of discussing the guidance. I would welcome his views and comments and those of the hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not claim to have the monopoly on wisdom. We are discussing new responsibilities. The right way to proceed is to issue the guidance in draft form first—the traditional way—to ensure that people are happy and confident with the positions that we are suggesting that they take up. We can develop a final set of statutory guidance later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no hiding place. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we will need to make difficult judgment calls. Having created the new duty, we do not intend to keep local authorities in the dark about how they must discharge it. We intend to discharge our responsibility to help authorities to come to terms with their new responsibilities. The issue has been well aired, and the complexity of the circumstances has been highlighted. This debate has shown that the best place to deal with the issues under discussion is in guidance, rather than regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why it is always more convenient for Government to act by means of statutory guidance. We have become rather accustomed to complaining that we are considering Bills that have little meaning until we see the regulations. However, we do at least see the regulations formally in Parliament at some stage. There is a problem with statutory guidance. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
appreciate the Minister's invitation to us as individuals to participate in the process, but I hope that that is not a substitute for proper parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to repeat that I am sure that the Minister will be extremely careful in framing his statutory guidance to ensure that it addresses the legitimate concerns raised by hon. Members. However, that is a poor substitute for having a Bill that we can understand before us now. Every time the Minister says, "This will all become clear through statutory guidance", he takes a little away from the importance of the Committee's task. We are considering a Bill whose meaning is difficult to interpret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the hon. Gentleman on one point? Issuing guidance is not convenient for the Government. That is not our position at all. It is more convenient for local authorities. I remind him that the Children Act 1989, which his party introduced, was accompanied by 10 or 11 volumes of separate guidance. It is not terribly helpful to point the finger at the Government and claim that we are acting secretively. By common consent, guidance is the best way of dealing with such complex social care policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not recall the Minister or other Labour Members ever complimenting the previous Government on their methods. Statutory guidance can be expedient and changed more easily than regulations, but I am not sure why local authorities would prefer it. Perhaps that is because guidance is more flexible. However, the Minister's answer leaves us with real problems in dealing with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows well that we tabled the amendment to establish the reasonable steps that a local authority would have to take, so that we could understand better the Bill's intention for adults who want to opt out of the process. We will now have to debate that issue without having a clear idea of how the duty to take reasonable steps to resume contact with the relevant child or former relevant child can be discharged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he did not intend to let local authorities interpret for themselves how they should comply with the obligation. It is important that authorities know whether they are complying with their obligations, which means that they must understand those obligations. Without detailed guidance or regulations from the Government, I suspect that many authorities would find that difficult to do. It is also important to ensure consistency of application, to avoid returning to the familiar territory of widely differing practices. The Minister observed that some local authorities comply with their obligations more diligently than others, and other hon. Members said that we had to be careful about creating loopholes for any local authorities seeking to avoid their obligations. Therefore, we must know what will be required of the local authorities and when they must act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unclear who will decide whether the authority has lost touch with a child or an adult. The Minister said that the meaning of keeping in touch would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
depend on the context. That is obvious common sense, but when placing a statutory obligation on someone to do X in circumstance Y, it creates problems to say that the existence of circumstance Y depends on the context. I look forward to seeing the draft guidance, but it will be difficult for the Minister to produce guidance that achieves consistent application, allows local authorities to know for certain that they have discharged their responsibilities and provides for the varied circumstances that the Minister described, without being oppressive or ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the purpose of the amendment was to obtain information to inform a later debate. We have not achieved that, but the amendment has served its purpose as best it could, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 4, line 39, leave out from first 'to' to end of line 40 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'seek to agree with the former relevant child a pathway plan and to keep that plan under regular review.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 7, in page 5, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5A) The local authority may make the assistance given under subsection (4)(c) conditional upon adherence by the former relevant child to the agreed pathway plan.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would replace the requirement simply to keep the pathway plan under review with a requirement more appropriate for dealing with an adult. To some extent, our debate may reflect comments that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight made about the language that should be used in relation to the pathway plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that when dealing with adults, it would be more appropriate to use the phrase that appears in amendment No. 8, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>seek to agree with the former relevant child a pathway plan and to keep that plan under regular review.</p></blockquote>
That fits in with the overall pattern that is emerging about how the Bill will treat adults, it reflects the Minister's intentions and, judging by the comments of other Committee members, the proposal is widely supported. We need a collaborative process between the former relevant child and the local authority, and the amendment would make that explicit in the Bill—it would change the relationship to one of partnership, if that is what the young adult wants. We shall later debate whether the proposal should apply in every case or only when the young person wants to be involved in the process. It is self-evident—we briefly discussed this earlier—that if the young person does not want to be involved and seeks to be obstructive, the process will not work properly anyway, and it would be more sensible, for moral and pragmatic reasons, to recognise that at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 refers only to new section 23C(4)(c). At the risk of repeating comments that were made this morning, the amendment would not give a local authority flexibility over its basic obligations to provide accommodation and sustenance for the former relevant child, but it would create a system
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
involving carrots and sticks. It would treat the pathway plan as an agreed course of action and involve the incentive of the additional assistance that local authorities can provide for adhering to a plan, for making reasonable attempts to stay within the spirit of a plan or for moving in the direction that a plan maps out. It would create disincentives against deviating from the plan in a significant way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that support should be withdrawn if someone fails to do something or has a temporary aberration. I clarified in earlier debates what I am driving at in this context—that there must be a way to send a signal to someone who systematically abuses the help offered to him. We all operate with carrots and sticks—there are few people who would get up at 6 am if they were not incentivised to do so and disincentivised to remain in bed. That is how we operate—that is the nature of human beings. I am wary of a system that offers incentives and support if someone carries out a certain course of action-although that course of action might be to his benefit in the long run, he might not always be able to see that in the short term—but which has no mechanism for dealing with deviation from the agreed path or outright abuse of the support that he is given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pity the hon. Gentleman for having such a limited view of the human spirit and the human condition. However, I have a specific question. His amendment implies that we can harm the welfare of people who do not behave according to the plan. Is that really what he has in mind? Is that really what he has in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; and let me say, for the record, that the day that I require pity from the hon. Gentleman will be a sad one for me. Perhaps his remarks reflect his view of the world. I do not back away from my view that most of us require incentives and disincentives to motivate us to do the things that we have to do, and the things that it is right for us to do. That is how human beings operate. Perhaps the Minister does not require such incentives, but instead slaves away at his Boxes late into the night and gets up early in the morning to prepare for his Standing Committees, not in the hope of preferment as a reward for his diligence but out of devotion to the task before him. He is indeed a remarkable person if that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To address the point raised by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, I hope that the intention behind the amendment is clear. Goodness knows, we discussed the issue on Second Reading and we have discussed it again this morning. Whether or not the amendment is perfectly drafted, I am seeking a debate about the signals that we shall send out when dealing with people who do not want to be constrained by the system. As I said this morning, I understand that the Government's intention is that young people will be engaged in education, training or work. I am afraid that we might inadvertently create a fourth option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the matter this morning, the Minister said that he would deal with it at the appropriate point in the debate. We have clearly reached that point. I hope, therefore, that the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
will be able to reassure me. In most of the Government's proposals, they have not indicated that they want to be seen as a soft touch for people who wish to avoid pursuing one of those courses of action. I would not, therefore, expect the Minister to want to send a signal that a fourth, soft option exists in the Bill. I have tabled the amendment in the hope that the Minister will now be able to explain to the Committee what he will expect a local authority to do with a person who refuses to follow the agreed course of action in the pathway plan. How would he like a local authority to proceed when a person persistently, after reviews, refuses to do what he or she has agreed to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge for tabling the amendment. For those of us who were perplexed on Second Reading about what the sanctions might be, the amendment makes that clear. Having read it, and listened to the hon. Gentleman, I am even less happy with the idea of the sanctions. The amendment would make assistance given under new subsection (4)(c) conditional on
	<br><blockquote><p>adherence by the former relevant child to the agreed pathway plan.</p></blockquote>
However, new subsection (4)(c) makes provision for
	<br><blockquote><p>other assistance, to the extent that his welfare requires it.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me correct the hon. Gentleman on a technicality. The amendment would not require the assistance to be conditional. It would allow the local authority to make it conditional. The word "may" is very important in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the word "may" is in the amendment, and that no duty would be placed on a local authority. However, we should not encourage local authorities by permissive legislation to do anything that counteracts what they would, in other circumstances, be doing for the welfare of the child or young person concerned. The Bill seems significantly to be moving along the child care system and putting the child—and the welfare of the child and young person—at the centre of the system. However, the amendment would allow those local authorities that were referred to this morning as rather "extreme" to use the big stick approach to clobber young people who were not doing what the authorities wanted them to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To correct the hon. Gentleman again, he has twice spoken about a child. The amendment refers to former relevant children—that is, adults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. I am using the terminology in the Bill. We have already had the debate about the use of "child" and "young person".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more positive note, the amendment is unnecessary, because the pathway planning process is a two-way process that involves the local authority and the child—or young person or former relevant child. The hon. Gentleman made a valid point about the final part of the process if an authority were to find
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
that a young person consistently rejected all assistance and refused to co-operate. That is a fair question, but the amendment does not answer it. The answer must lie in the pathway planning process, during which local authorities, like good parents, will be able to say to a young person, "You have abused the plan here and failed to carry it out there: we need to sit down and rewrite it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman sets out his case elegantly. However, the mythical young person may say, "I don't care what you want to put in my pathway plan—I'll agree to whatever you want, but I'm not going to do it. However, you are going to carry on accommodating me and supporting me, because it says so in this Bill, and there's nothing you can do about it." I do not have a background of working with young people, but I have had enough contact with them to know that some will see an opportunity to say to the person with whom they are negotiating, "Do what you like—I know that you can't do anything to me, and I'm immune to your protestations." What would one do in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall never face that situation with my children, but I know from working with young people that some of them will take that approach. Good corporate parents will do what good parents would do in respect of that person: continue to house them, look after their welfare, and encourage them to develop their educational and training opportunities, and thereby their prospects of becoming adults participating fully in society. That is not a soft option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A better example than that provided by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would be that of a young person who had proved to be positively dangerous to other young people. The person may have to be removed from the situation, but that would not prevent one from caring for them, developing a plan for them or providing them with appropriate accommodation. Nothing that the hon. Gentleman has said is supported by the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that example, which counterbalances the example that was given by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. In the final analysis, the Bill is about supporting the weakest, most deprived members of our society—young people leaving care—who are constantly buffeted, sometimes by the care system, and always by their personal circumstances. The Bill must ensure that maximum opportunities are afforded to those young people. If that means that, apart from the general 95 per cent., 5 per cent, misuse the care system—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If those people eventually leave the system, having refused all the offers of welfare and support that the Bill facilitates, then, as the hon. Gentleman said, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must accept that there will be failures in the care system. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made an important point in asking what a local authority might do when a pathway plan breaks down, but the amendment—which deliberately targets a provision that can extend welfare assistance to young people—is not the right way to address that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) said the other day, "You may be Prime Minister for a while, but you will be a parent for life." That sums up the purpose of the Bill: someone is parent for life to these people, who need particular assistance from us. The amendment negates one of the Bill's major purposes: to ensure that someone is onside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes suggested that people should be reminded of their responsibilities, as well as of their rights. That is entirely right, but I do not accept the suggestion that people respond only to carrot and stick. Many youngsters do not; many children—not including my own—refuse to comply with their parents' wishes. None the less, they still have a right to support. The amendment would negate that responsibility of the local authority. I accept that the authority has the option to decide, but such a negation of responsibility would leave the youngster vulnerable. The amendment should be withdrawn or, if it is not, defeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people we are discussing today are not on probation; they are young people in need of support, and that support should be unconditional. I am worried by the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. It envisages what is almost, as the hon. Member for Ceredigion said, an opt-out clause for local authorities. I am also concerned that there should be some fallback position, if the young persons do not want the benefit of support from a local authority. We will come to that when we discuss amendment No. 34.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand the reasoning behind the carrot-and-stick approach to people who are being parented. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has a few years before his children get to that stage, but he should think about the line that he is taking today: the people who get the stick most often are the least responsive to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have examined carefully the proceedings relating to this part of the Bill in the other place, and I am not aware of any support from any organisation for the stance that the hon. Gentleman is taking. Not even his noble Friends supported the views that he has expressed today in relation to sanctions and amendment No. 8, which would water down the duty on local authorities to keep the young person's
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
pathway plan under review. In the worst-case scenario, the amendment might provide exactly the sort of loophole that we are anxious to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's misunderstanding of this part of the Bill might arise from his appreciation of the sort of duties that the local authority will have. The hon. Member for Ceredigion said, rightly, that the Bill already makes the support provided by the local authority conditional: the authority must be satisfied that the person's welfare needs require such support. That is the basis on which the local authority should be required to support a young person—or not, as the case may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That decision should not be based on adherence to the pathway plan, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge suggests. The amendment would build a fundamental contradiction into new section 23C(4)(a) and (b), which specifies the requirement for support, by adding an extra condition requiring the young person to comply with a pathway plan to activate the support. That could, by definition, jeopardise the young person's welfare. Support should be conditional on welfare needs, not linked to compliance with the pathway plan, which could jeopardise the young person's welfare. The clause would become technically unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many of the reasons given by my hon. Friends and the hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Ceredigion, the amendment is misplaced. We live in the real world and those of us with children know how difficult relationships with them can be. Local authorities will have to deal with cases in which young people do not comply with the terms of their pathway plan. The amendment would not allow us to distinguish successfully between wilful non-compliance and the unfortunate consequences of a young person not properly managing a budget, not paying a gas bill, not successfully managing a tenancy, and so on. The amendment would punish that young person by preventing the local authority from providing welfare support for that young person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman's option would allow one strike, then that young person would be out. What would be the consequences for those young people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that were the result of the amendment, it would be a matter of deep concern to all of us, including the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I am sure that he does not envisage young people being penalised in that way, but his amendment would allow a local authority to do precisely that. I do not understand how that can be regarded as a constructive measure, or how it fits in with the welfare obligations of local authorities to support this group of young people.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to circumstances in which the pathway plan specifies a particular course of study to which the young person agrees, but he then drops out of the course. It is important to understand what duties the local authority will have in such circumstances. Assistance to people aged 18 to 21 under new section 23C(4)(a) and (b) is clearly linked to the pathway plan; those duties will be triggered in the context of education, training and employment. A review will be necessary to ensure that the plan is being followed as intended, and support can be withdrawn because the duty of support is clearly linked to the plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mistakenly describes the situation of a young person aged 18 to 21 holding up two fingers to the local authority, deliberately ignoring the pathway plan and telling the local authority that it has a duty to house him and to provide cash and support. That is not an accurate picture. The precise duties in relation to 18 to 21-year olds are clear in the Bill: there is no positive or actual duty to accommodate or maintain that group. The duty is to give assistance to the extent that their welfare needs require it; it is not a general duty of support. In most cases, it would be occasional and might take the form of cash in exceptional circumstances. The duty in respect of accommodation arises in the context of vacation periods while the young person is in higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge provided the scenario of a wilfully obstructive young person giving the local authority the finger and saying, "You have to throw a lot of cash at me and everyone else can sod off'. Get real—that is unlikely to happen. Mrs. Michie, I must apologise to you for speaking more graphically than I would normally want to. I did not intend to give offence to any member of the Committee, especially not you; I was simply trying to imagine what a young person might say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge are misguided both in principle and in practice. They would water down important duties that should not be watered down and allow some authorities to evade their responsibilities. They might punish young people who have made mistakes, rather than those who had been deliberately and wilfully obstructive. We all make mistakes, and I do not think that the punishment that the hon. Gentleman envisages is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duties to support young people that we have put into the Bill are, rightly, conditional on meeting young people's welfare needs. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman will not be terribly satisfied with that response, but I hope that he will not press the amendment to a Division. If he does so, I will have no hesitation in asking my hon. Friends to resist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been vilified for adopting a position that suggests that support could be withdrawn from those who do not adhere to their pathway plans. Hon. Members around the Room have bobbed up to say, "Outrageous! Such people must continue to be supported. We cannot have a one-strike-and-you're-out approach." All sorts of reasons have been given why those people should continue to be supported even when they do not comply with the plans, and the hon. Member for Ceredigion says that it is too bad if a small number slip through the net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us that the Bill is capable of having precisely the effect that I want it to have and that other hon. Members said that it should not have, although he would prefer not to express it the way I do. He says that if a young person wilfully, deliberately, systematically and continuously ignores the pathway plan, support can be withdrawn. That is what the Minister says and what the Bill states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head, although I think that that is what he said. I feel that my position has been misrepresented by some hon. Members, and that I may not have presented it properly myself. However, I always intended to focus on the extreme case—the long-stop position. I envisage an authority that has made diligent efforts to encourage an individual and to review and revise the plan to meet changing circumstances; it has overlooked the individual's failure to do as he or she promised, but eventually it starts to feel that rings are being rung around it or, as the Minister put it, that the individual is giving it the finger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that the wording of the amendment does not provide the outcome that he intended. If the question is one of withdrawing the resources that are part of a pathway plan in addition to a young person's normal welfare support, I can go along with him. Can he make it clear whether he would ever sanction not supplying an individual's welfare needs, no matter how undesirable that individual is, in his eyes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding, subject to clause 6, is that the welfare needs of all individuals in our society over the age of 18 are cared for by our social security structure. Perhaps someone will correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think that we are talking about a group of over-18s who would have no other source of support if a local authority cut them off from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
support provided under the Bill. Those people would have full entitlement to range of support offered by the benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim to be an expert on the benefits system but, as I understand it, it is specifically tailored to encourage people, through precisely the carrots and sticks at which some hon. Members have taken offence, to do the kind of things that the Government think it right and appropriate that young adults should do. It is designed so that people do not have the option simply to live supported by benefits. The Government have made an exclusion for other young people, presumably not to be brutal, but because they have sensibly determined that it is not in those people's interests to be given a fourth option—nor, I believe, is it in the interests of children who have left care, or adults who are former relevant children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment may be technically deficient and it might not achieve precisely what I set out to achieve. I tried to draw out from the Minister details of how he intends to ensure that the sensible withdrawal of a fourth option from children in general was mirrored in the Bill. In his closing remarks, he robustly suggested that he did not expect the regime to involve local authorities continuing to provide discretionary support to people who abuse the assistance given to them and who are not willing to continue their educational or training plans. Although he speculated that I would not be reassured by what he said, I was to some extent by his tone. I do not set out to punish people who have made mistakes, as was suggested: that is no part of my intention. I simply want to provide a mechanism of last resort to deal with people who systematically abuse a system put in place to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the debate in the House of Lords, subsections (4) to (7) of new section 23C were inserted into the Bill. We recently debated the Care Standards Bill at length. During our deliberations, I noted that one studies and debates individual issues when considering individual amendments, and that a re-printed Bill arrives with all the amendments inserted some time later; sometimes that has a striking effect that is not always apparent when one is dealing with the issues, one at a time. When a provision has been substantially amended in another place, as subsection 23C has been, we must look at it in its entirety to see whether it is coherent and does what we want it to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly unhappy that my intentions have been taken to be so ungenerous. That was not the aim at all. I was thinking of the practical reality facing the people who have to make the system work. I should like to think that someone has thought through how to deal with the persistent refusenik—the person who does not want to co-operate with the system but simply wants to exploit it for whatever he can get. There are a small number of such people in all sections of society, including, I am quite sure, the population of former relevant children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given me quite a lot to think about in his comments, which I shall read carefully. I will also consider the points made by various hon. Members,
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
particularly the hon. Member for Ceredigion. Many good counterpoints have been made. I shall, if necessary, come back on Report with a rather different approach, but one that still aims to ensure that there is a way to deal with persistent abusers of the system. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can move to a broader, more generous and frankly, more realistic debate than we have endured so far. My right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)—I was going to call him the sage—has already been quoted today. His immortal phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>someone to touch for a tenner when they are skint—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 June 2000; Vol. 352, c. 378.]</p></blockquote>
is the theme of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we truly expect local authorities to be corporate parents and to bring up young people as we would want to bring them up ourselves, in a way that would have been good enough for us as children, the phrase "in exceptional circumstances" is extremely offensive. It does not fit with the overall tenor of the rest of the Bill and is a throwback to section 24 of the Children Act 1989. It is part of the failure of that part of the Children Act that local authorities were inspired to be quite so ungenerous and unhelpful to young people in their care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to see in the proposed new section 23B(9) that support for relevant children "may be in cash". The offending phrase "in exceptional circumstances" applies only to former relevant children. I have two adult children; when they were younger, as far as they were concerned, the major function of parents was to cough up dosh at regular intervals. I am not saying that money should doled out in great handfuls at the mere thrust of a hand or on a whim, or that money should not be refused in many circumstances, but sometimes it is the best help that young people can be given. Young people who have left care or who may be working or in training or full-time education will occasionally need money, whether in the normal run of events, or when things have gone slightly awry, or when some disaster has occurred. The usual recourse for young people would be to ask their parents for help. If the hard-hearted treasurers of local authorities see the words, "exceptional circumstances", those concerned will have no hope of receiving money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In keeping with the spirit of the Bill and corporate parenting—and the desire to offer real assistance to young people who have left care—we should remove those three offending words. After professional assessment and with due regard to financial probity, local authorities should be able to offer former relevant children the same kind of financial support that the Bill makes available to relevant children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre for spotting the phrase "in exceptional circumstances", which I had missed, and I support his comments. If a member of the Committee had suggested an amendment to insert the words "in exceptional circumstances", the Minister would have told the Committee that it was redundant, as the Bill already creates a framework in which all payments necessary for the welfare of the individual concerned will be made, although judgment will be exercised as to whether support in kind or in cash is most appropriate. Does the wording "in exceptional circumstances" mean that it should be exceptional for a local authority, in general, to hand out a cash payment, even when it is necessary? Alternatively, should it be exceptional for the one individual who may suddenly find a need? I envisage that individuals who are not good at coping may have to be supported on more than one occasion—perhaps even regularly, for a short time—while they get themselves organised. Exceptional payments would then almost become ordinary payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. Removing the words "in exceptional circumstances" would not open up the floodgates. It will still be a matter of appropriate practice and support, as denned elsewhere in the Bill. The words are unnecessary, and I, too, find them offensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is the first time that I have served on a Standing Committee where a joint amendment between Liberal Democrats and Government Back-Benchers has been tabled. Perhaps that is happening more regularly, but it slightly wrong-foots hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It happened in the Care Standards Bill on two or three occasions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must bear in mind that those who vote for us often find our conduct in this place confusing enough as it is. The electorate understand the terms "Opposition" and "Government" relatively well, but there is some blurring of the boundaries that makes it difficult for people to know exactly where parties are coming from—although there is no doubt where my party is coming from on the issue. In deference to the Minister, I may make some of the arguments that a Government would make, but I had understood that one of the principal purposes of the Bill was to address the serious problem of how children leaving care can access state funding for their welfare. One of the major changes introduced in a later clause is the move away from the system under which care leavers had a perverse incentive to leave care to access benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that, if the Minister were to accept the amendment, increased dependency on cash would result and the circumstances in which cash could be used would not be precisely denned. From what I
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
know of young people of this age, they find it tremendously difficult to manage cash. It is interesting that the Government are increasingly looking at ways of helping people while also accounting for public money through the introduction, for example, of voucher systems, as we have seen under the Carers and Disabled Children Bill. No one now makes philosophical objections to vouchers being used as a way of accounting for public money and being, rightly, used to help vulnerable people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady recognise that giving people vouchers may stop them gaining experience in handling cash, which in her eyes—and I tend to agree—is so important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply using the example of the different ways in which the Government are considering effectively providing financial support to vulnerable people. My concern is that cash seems to disappear into thin air; one finds it with one's own children and with oneself—by the end of the week, the money that one has taken out of the cashpoint seems to have gone nowhere. Cash is the most difficult form of resource to track and I am not sure that we would be doing young people a service by removing the phrase "in exceptional circumstances". At the very least, the phrase would prescribe more tightly the moment at which intervention was regarded as necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members chuckle, but would my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The Minister told him earlier that there was a need to "get real". That is a good illustration of the need to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to do the Government's job for them. I suspect that the Minister will reject the amendment for, among other things, the reasons that I gave the hon. Members for Lancaster and Wyre and for Isle of Wight. The Government must account for the way in which public money is used, and I am sure that the Minister had that in mind when the Bill was drafted. We should wait to hear from him, as he should make his case most effectively to a Government Back Bencher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that Committees were ideal places for hon. Members to work across party lines and develop solutions for Bills on which party political ties are not too strong. Having said that, I approach the amendments with some caution. I hope that that does not confuse the hon. Member for Meriden too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the difference between a former relevant child who has access to the benefits system, and the relevant child who has no access. My take on the situation is slightly different from that of the hon. Lady. I accept that I do not have the same wide experience as some Labour Members, but as a county councillor member of a social services committee, I came across anecdotal evidence of the Children Act's permissive powers to give cash being used to fob off difficult young people with a tenner to make them go away for a few days. Sometimes, that is easier than sitting down with a young person and spending time and energy on talking through that person's problems. That costs a lot more than a tenner, £20, or whatever amount is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not worried about cash falling into the criminal sphere. That is not a realistic objection. However, if the Minister wants to keep the words "in exceptional circumstances", I would like him to explain clearly the practical meaning of those words. I do not want local authorities to use them as a defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman repeated the scoffing at the idea that some people might choose not to use cash to obtain accommodation, but to sleep in a doorway and use the cash for other purposes. Those of us who live in the Westminster area cannot avoid encountering people who use every available bit of their cash to obtain drugs or alcohol. I do not suggest that they do that from choice; clearly, that is not a rational choice. However, does the hon. Gentleman foresee no downside to giving cash to vulnerable people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly was not scoffing. The hon. Gentleman answered his own question by dealing with the issue circuitously. I do not dispute the fact that cash can be misused, but young people can receive benefits and choose how to use that money. The Government do not propose to withdraw benefits from young people because they can spend their money on a flagon of cider rather than a decent meal. We must encourage young people to make sensible choices, which is what most of the Bill tries to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
I do not accept that the argument made by the hon. Member for Meriden about the possibility of a little bit of cash slipping into the black market is relevant to whether we accept or reject the phrase "in exceptional circumstances". The argument must be about the right amount of assistance to offer to former relevant young people, and the Bill states that there must be exceptional circumstances for that assistance to be in the form of cash. I accept that one reason for that might be that they have access to the benefit system that other eligible and relevant children do not, but what are those exceptional circumstances? Will guidance be published about them? How can we ensure that that provision will not be used as a defence by some local authorities not to give assistance to young people that would be for their better welfare? Clearly, on occasions, it is better for cash to be extended as a loan, for example, to buy a rental bond for a property. It would be a pity if we thwarted young people having access to a limited amount of cash that they might expect from the good parent to set them up in their independent living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we have had an interesting debate and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre for bringing the issue to the Committee's attention. It may help him to feel more comfortable with the Bill if I were to make it clear that proposed new section 23C(4) provides for one of the duties of local authorities in respect of the support arrangements for such young people. It is possible that, under other provisions—for example, proposed new sections 24B(2)(a) and (b) and 24B(5)—young care leavers could be provided with cash by the local authority to help them to meet their expenses of living near the place of education or training, to be given a grant to enable them to meet expenses in relation to education or training and to secure accommodation during a vacation. None of those three examples are qualified by the words "in exceptional circumstances". My hon. Friend has picked on one duty of the local authority, which is to provide support when the welfare needs of the young person require it to be provided. He was right to say that we have carried forward provisions under the Children Act 1989 in that regard and I am sure that he understands why we did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion made a convincing case for the Bill to remain as it is drafted. It may help my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre if I were to say that making cash payments contingent on there being exceptional cases is not to imply that they are not a serious option. We believe that, at times, young people need more help than a cash handout. Let us consider a young person who approaches a local authority and says that he needs a certain amount of cash for his travelling expenses and asks for £25 for that night. The best solution to that problem may be the provision of a Travelcard or the purchase of a railway ticket to meet his welfare requirements.

In a nutshell, we are trying to ensure that cash assistance is provided only when it is appropriate, not as a substitute income, but in exceptional circumstances as and when they arise. We can then ensure that cash assistance is given only when it would genuinely solve a problem, rather than just to remove someone from social services premises. My hon. Friend, with his experience, is probably aware of the syndrome when it could be regarded as an easy solution to give the young person in difficulty a few quid in the hope that he will go away and the problem will be solved. Of course, the problem will not be solved. I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured that the Bill does not imply that. There will never be a sensible set of circumstances where the right solution to a problem is to give cash to a young person who needs support. Local authorities will be able to judge when such action is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion asked me to explain what we mean by "exceptional circumstances". I am reluctant to do so for reasons that I hope he will understand, not because I am being evasive. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is anticipating my remarks. We may issue guidance, although I am not sure that it was not already issued by the previous Administration under the Children Act. However, we shall track that one down to see whether new and further guidance needs to be issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the uncertainty about the meaning of the phrase "in exceptional circumstances" and about what the guidance will be, does the Minister accept that it would be more sensible to drop those words? Guidance can be just as useful in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a judgment call that we have made. We strongly believe that the provision is perfectly consistent with the aim of the legislation. It does not truncate or limit local authorities' ability to give young people effective support. In some circumstances, that may be in cash. The expression "in exceptional circumstances" has not given rise to the chaos of interpretation that the hon. Gentleman implied. The term is not new. Local authorities are familiar with it and have been using it for the past 10 years, since the Children Act has been in force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen recent figures, but it is clear that local authorities have used the power to make cash payments sparingly and inadequately, hiding behind the "in exceptional circumstances" rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman shared that intelligence with me. I do not know the information to which he refers. It may be an anecdotal reference from casework in his constituency. I am not sure whether he can make the general assertion that all local authorities use the term as a mechanism whereby they avoid making cash payments, but I do not believe that that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any guidance issued by previous Administrations. Does the Minister accept that it seems, at least from anecdotal evidence, that the ability to pay cash in extreme circumstances is ineffectually, if not inadequately, used? The Minister said that the answer in some circumstances is cash. In other circumstances, the answer is another sort of assistance. Does he accept that, in retaining the provision, he should consider the need for clearer guidance for local authorities on how cash assistance may be extended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I told the hon. Gentleman that we would consider whether we needed to make guidance available to local authorities to explain precisely the circumstances to which he and other hon. Members have drawn attention. As I said to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, my understanding is that the expression is not causing mayhem. There may be inconsistencies in the way in which local authorities interpret the provision. Of course, that is generally a bad thing. If that is happening, we want to ensure that it does not continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre are not sufficiently substantial for me to consider recommending the amendments to the Committee. I have listed three examples of circumstances in which local authorities are perfectly able to make cash payments for specific purposes under the Bill. They can also make cash payments in those circumstances under proposed new section 24C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to ensure that the support provided for young people is effective. I urge my hon. Friend to accept the retention of the words "in exceptional circumstances", because we want that support to be appropriate and not send a signal that the way to support people is always to provide the cash solution. I am sure that he is not suggesting that that is the case, but many people might interpret the removal of those words as having precisely that effect. It is a difficult balance to strike. Perhaps my hon. Friend takes a different view. I am confident that the construction of the Bill strikes a fair and reasonable balance and can be interpreted practically to ensure that young people receive the support and help from local authorities that they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those extremely helpful reassurances. I thank the hon. Member for Isle of Wight for his support and what he said about the issue. It is important to note that we have experienced a true meeting of minds, because we had never discussed the issue outside the Committee Room. I tabled the amendments independently. In some circumstances, it is better to be able to offer young people the experience of cash help with particular problems, as that is a normal and ordinary experience of being parented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion cited disgraceful examples of local authorities giving young people money to go away. I have experience of the converse—wasting an immense amount of time trying to counsel, cajole, persuade and eventually deal with a young person over an issue when it would have been far more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
appropriate to help resolve the problem with a few quid and a pat on the back. However, I recognise the generous spirit in which the contribution was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was appalled by the contribution of Conservative Members. First they provided a justification in terms of benefit dependency. The proposal has nothing to do with benefit dependency. It has to do with a simple, generous act of parenting and support. That is the ordinary experience of young adults who have a family background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, the use of vouchers was suggested. I have experience from more than a decade ago of taking children out from children's homes with a voucher book and buying clothes, and it is the most demeaning and corrosive experience possible. Proposing to replicate such a system for young people who have left care betrays a complete misunderstanding of the experience of care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the hon. Gentleman can enlighten us in our misunderstanding, why do the Government propose to use vouchers for asylum seekers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another subject. In those particular circumstances, people have not grown up with the difficulties of being in care and the connotations of vouchers and all the associated paraphernalia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to finish this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then heard the worst statement of all, which showed the almost reflexive and automatic linking of young people leaving care with crime, drugs and serious misbehaviour. That shows, once again, a demeaning attitude towards young people in care. Those remarks were entirely inappropriate, and the hon. Gentleman should withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of withdrawing those remarks. I believe that they will strike most people as a bout of common sense. Some of the hon. Gentleman's comments strike me as a large amount of wishful thinking. My question is germane to both of his last two points. Why do the Government whom he supports propose to give vouchers instead of cash to asylum seekers if no material purpose is served by doing so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.28 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>6.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were discussing why we support a Government who have introduced vouchers for asylum seekers. Some Committee members were horrified at the prospect of similar provisions applying to young people in care. However, the distinction is obvious: vouchers were explicitly introduced to make this country less attractive to people who might come here purely as economic migrants rather than because they suffered persecution and oppression in their own
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
country. We are trying to help young people in care to live their lives and to move on from being the responsibility of local authorities and the state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the benefit of the break, the temperature in the Committee Room may have been lowered slightly. I suspect that the Minister does not wholly agree with the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the Government's motive for moving to non-cash systems of support for asylum seekers, which may have something to do with the dangers of the cash leaking back into the financing of illegal methods of entry. I would like to ask the hon. Gentleman—because he has considerable experience in these matters—whether he recognises the fact that, although no one wants to stigmatise all care leavers as people likely to engage in criminality or drug abuse, this is a serious problem. Does this issue not need to be addressed before putting cash into the hands of vulnerable people who, experience tells us, might be likely to misuse it? The issue cannot simply be swept under the carpet, as the hon. Gentleman has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Young people in care are not criminals. There is no reason to suppose that they would misuse cash any more than any other young adult would. Of course, there is always the possibility that any young adult would spend some ready money in ways that more mature adults would consider inappropriate. However, it is wrong automatically to jump to the conclusion that someone in the care system—who may have committed no criminal offence, been in no trouble whatsoever and led a life even more blameless than that of a Member of Parliament—would go off and misuse that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry about the tone of this debate. We disagree on some issues, and three points gave real offence to a number of hon. Members. Those points, coupled with the narrow ideas about managing young people that were expressed in the previous debate, have done nothing to aid our consideration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that young people leaving care are as likely—or unlikely—to experiment with illegal substances as any other member of the population and that we should not design systems to protect them any more than anyone else? Does he also agree that a small amount of financial support in cash could be part of a programme to get a person with a substance misuse problem off dependency and into a more regular life style?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go down that road, but I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. The points made by my hon. Friend the Minister have been extremely sound, and this is a fine Bill. This provision is one scar on it, but I shall try to remedy it through persistence and nagging outside the Committee Room. The idea that guidance could be issued on when circumstances are exceptional is most helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 5, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7A) The duties of a local authority under this section in respect of a former relevant child shall cease during any period when an effective election made by the former relevant child is in force.
	<ol>
	<li>A local authority may not discharge any of the powers or duties set out in subsection (2), (3) and (4) in respect of any former relevant child in respect of whom an effective election is in force.</li>
	<li>The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision with regard to the making and withdrawal of an effective election by a former relevant child for the purposes of this subsection.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 11, in clause 4, page 7, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) he has not indicated to the relevant authority that he does not wish to receive advice and assistance under this section or section 24 or section 24B.'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>No. 12, in page 8, line 27, at end insert</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'and who has not made an effective election in accordance with 23C(7A) or indicated to the relevant authority that he does not wish to receive advice and assistance under 24A(2)(c) as the case may be'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is becoming increasingly clear to me why the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre is sitting where he is and why the Minister is sitting where he is. It appears that the Minister has acknowledged, in introducing the Bill, many of the things that the hon. Gentleman was denying. However, I hope that we can lower the temperature a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments addresses another fundamental concern about the structure of the Bill and the way in which it will work. I want to raise two separate points about the way in which the Bill deals with adults. The first is, if the Committee likes, a moral issue about how we should treat adults. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre has just made the case for children leaving care being no more or less likely to do something than the generality of young people of that age, yet the Bill proposes treating them differently from other young adults, whether they like it or not. That involves a real issue about the individual rights of young adults which must be addressed. It may be inconvenient, and I know that hon. Members are worried that this will create loopholes. However, if all young people are to be treated as adults once they reach the age of 18, and are to be given the respect and independence that adults deserve, we must be consistent about the way in which that is achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue concerns human rights legislation and the presumptions that it makes about the rights to privacy and self-determination of competent adults who are outwith the criminal justice or mental health systems. Having made the usual disclaimers about the quality of the drafting of the amendments, I hope that their purpose is clear. They would allow an adult who is a former relevant child to opt out of the process that the Bill establishes—not permanently, but for a period of time that he or she chooses. He or she could opt out of the process of putting the pathway plan in place, the process by which it is regularly reviewed or the maintenance of contact with the responsible local authority. A young person who decided, as an adult,
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
that he or she wanted to move away from the area, and did not wish the authority to remain in contact, could opt to make an election to that effect. That would allow that young person to go about his or her business as an adult in society, with all the rights and respect to which that entitles him or her. It would not close off the option to return to the responsible local authority in future by withdrawing that election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot have a system that imposes a regime of monitoring compulsory contact with people who are adults who have committed no offence, have been convicted of no crime and are not engaged under any of the processes of the mental health Acts, but are fully competent adults going about their lawful business. The methodology by which I chose to address that drew on comments that were made by hon. Members, including some who are in the Room, when I raised the issue on Second Reading. I deliberately phrased the amendment in such a way as to give the Secretary of State the power, by regulations, to make detailed provisions on how an adult who wished to detach himself from the system would go about doing so, and how he would withdraw that election and reinsert himself into the system, should he wish to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He will remember from the debates in the other place that the Government amended the Bill at the request of Opposition parties to strengthen its provisions on duties for local authorities in relation to 18 to 21-year-olds. Would not the amendments reduce those duties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Bill, as amended in the House of Lords, places obligations on local authorities to do certain things. The Minister made it clear on Second Reading that, for some time, local authorities have had the ability to do certain things that the Bill will give them a duty to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks will focus on subsections (2) and (3) of new section 23C, which were part of the original Bill that was introduced in the House of Lords. Those subsections require the local authority
	<br><blockquote><p>to keep in touch with a former relevant child…to re-establish contact…to continue the appointment of a personal adviser</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>to continue to keep his pathway plan under regular review.</p></blockquote>
There is a considerable difference between seeking to expand the help that must be given to someone who wants it and raising the objection that the system should not trap someone who does not want it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the provisions are intended to be supportive and helpful and will, as I said on Second Reading and earlier today, be regarded as such by the great majority. However, I can think of no other situation in which there is such on-going monitoring of an adult individual who has committed no offence and who is mentally competent. He may well find that monitoring intrusive. Having considered the logic of what was decided in the other place, and recognising the value of what new section 23C will do, we must ensure that there is an opt-out for competent adults who do not want to be part of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman feel that the pathway plan process does not meet most of his concerns? Much of this section is bound up with the pathway plan. A young person may say, as part of the pathway plan, that he or she does not want the personal adviser to make contact more than once a year and may specify a way in which he or she will maintain contact with the relevant authority. Would that not address the hon. Gentleman's concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The authority would not have the discretion to accept that. The authority has a clear duty to keep in touch with the young person, reestablish contact and review the plan. An adult who has committed no offence and is fully mentally competent has a fundamental right to say, "I do not wish to be treated in this discriminatory way. I do not wish to be singled out as different, because of my childhood. I am an adult who wants to make a clean break. I am grateful for the offer of help, but I wish to decline it. I do not wish to be stigmatised"—that is how some people will see it—"in this way."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to create the possibility that a competent adult will be able to withdraw from the system. We do not want to create a glaring loophole that frustrates the intention of this part of the Bill. That is why the amendment leaves it to the Secretary of State to determine, following consultation, how the withdrawal would take place. I envisage an exit procedure, requiring, perhaps, some form of interview or counselling—in other words, a proper procedure to ensure that the adult was properly informed about the choice and that the choice was made under properly controlled circumstances. The adult should be fully aware of the option to return to the system, which would be retained as long as he or she remained a former relevant child. Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are the flip-side of the coin. They make it clear that local authorities are not required to maintain or re-establish contact, maintain the plans or offer advice when an effective election is in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective is simple, but it is important for moral reasons. It is offensive for the state to put some people into a position in which they are monitored, a file is kept on them and their status is identified as different from that of other people because of their previous life. I suspect that, on leaving care, some people—but perhaps not many—want to put their past behind them and to make a clean break. Some members of the Committee might counsel them against that, but if any of the fine words that I have heard in this Room mean anything we must surely recognise that, when people become adults, they must be respected as individuals in their own right, with the right to make decisions about their future, including the decision that they do not want to be treated differently from those with whom they live, work or are being educated. We must also bear in mind the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be interested to know that, when I was in my constituency on Friday, I bumped into someone whom I know reasonably well who is a law
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
lecturer and an active member of the local Labour party—a relatively rare breed in my constituency. He told me that he will publish a book in October on the impact of the Human Rights Act and, among other things, the certificates that Ministers place on Bills. The Minister may want to inform his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the book will express the opinion that, if a court found that legislation that a Secretary of State had certified as being compliant with the Human Rights Act was not so compliant, that Secretary of State would have no option but to resign his position, having materially misled Parliament in its consideration of the Bill. I am sure that, as a paid-up and active member of the Labour party, my constituent will ensure that all relevant Ministers receive copies of his book, or least the interesting parts of it, when it is published in October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European convention on human rights includes article 8 on the right to respect for privacy and family life. The advice that I have received is that new section 23C, if not tempered by or modified with the ability for competent adults to remove themselves from the process, could contravene convention rights. I do not want to anticipate what the Minister will say, but, if he cannot accept the amendments, I hope that he will at least recognise that there is a problem because we have extended to adults a system that was originally conceived and designed to deal with children aged 16 and 17 who had left care but with whom contact needed to be maintained. I am anxious to hear what other Committee members have to say and then what the Minister says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be some time before the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has the chance to introduce a Bill as a member of a Government, and the occasion may never occur, but I look forward to seeing a private Member's Bill or ten-minute Bill next Session. It could be entitled the Break-Up of Families (Young Adults) Bill, and a major part of it could concern the ability of young adults to make an effective election that they want no contact, assistance, support and interest from their parents. That is the logical concomitant of what the hon. Gentleman says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the likelihood of my having the opportunity to introduce a Government Bill. This morning, I took the precaution of looking at the constituency profiles of all members of the Committee, and I suspect that, in the long run, I may have rather more chance of introducing one than he does. He must understand that there is a distinction concerning the role of statutory authorities and how they interfere with people's lives in terms of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the human rights convention. There is no analogy between the obligations that exist in families and the obligations created by statute in relation to individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My predecessor was in this place for 10 years, and it was his arrogance that led to his downfall as well. The situation is analogous. We are talking about parenting, and we have heard a lot of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
nonsense from the hon. Gentleman about what he terms "interference by the state". Let us face facts. If an adult has left care and adamantly does not want anything to do with the local authority that previously looked after him, the local authority can do nothing about it. What happens on the ground is that often young people who leave care put a metaphorical, and sometimes a literal, two fingers up to the local authority that has looked after them, and they want nothing more to do with it. That situation can last for a long or short time, often depending on the relationships and the local authority workers' ability to re-establish them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment completely undermines one of the main thrusts of the Bill, which is the extension of the statutory duty to 21 -year-olds. Hon. Members on both sides of the House worked hard to put that in place. Apart from that, the amendment casts the Opposition as the champions of homeless young people's remaining homeless, of addicted young people's
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
remaining addicted, of penniless young people's remaining penniless and of lonely and isolated young people's remaining without hope or help. The appalling amendment would simply erect and cement in place a barrier to young adults' regaining and remaking contact with the local authorities that are there to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that it is an infringements of people's human rights to offer people decent assistance, care and support in the terms of the Children Act, with all its implied concepts of partnership in listening and working together, shows that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge does not understand what the Bill is about. The care system is being remade via this Bill and the Care Standards Bill, and he does not understand what the new system amounts to. The amendment would be a licence for the inadequate local authority and the incompetent and lazy social worker to practise. It should be thrown out forthwith.
