	<div class='page-header'><h1>Nuclear Safeguards Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10. 30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Nuclear Safeguards Bill [	<i>Lords,</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Page 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say at the outset that I am delighted that you are overseeing our occupation of this Room, Mrs Roe? I hope that that occupation will be brief, subject to my being treated kindly by the Government. If I may borrow the words of Henry VIII to one of his wives, "I won't be keeping you long."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the sittings motion, I should like to put it on record that the Conservative party supports the principles behind the Bill. We believe that it is right to put this measure on the statute book. We do not want the number of countries with nuclear weapons programmes to increase; nor do we want civil nuclear programmes to be used as a cover for making such weaponry. That is why we have consistently supported ratification of the non-proliferation treaty that was signed in 1970, and the various measures implemented since 1991 to tighten monitoring and inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was upset to discover that the Government are trying to slide through this measure, which is so important that it should bear the stamp of Government, on a private Member's Bill. I make no criticism of the hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Colman). As a new boy, he was probably misled by the Whips, who wafted under his nose the delicate scent of possible preferment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Colman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Putney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a point of personal explanation, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that nothing was wafted under my nose. The measure is one that I wanted to make progress, and I am pleased to hear that both sides of the Committee seem to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have absolutely no doubt that the Government Whip will write against the hon. Gentleman's name phrases such as "excessive loyalty", "steady under fire" and "suitable for preferment at the earliest opportunity". The only problem is that I have yet to see the Whip make such a note. That is not an encouraging sign in respect of the hon. Gentleman's popularity and advancement but, as he knows, I am working on his behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to enact the Bill in this way, the Government have made a mistake, and they have made a further mistake, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) rightly took exception. On Second Reading, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
measure was properly discussed on the Floor of the House, but with half an hour to go the Government inexplicably truncated the debate. I look the Whip straight in the eye when I say that, given my right hon. Friend's involvement in the game, that was not a smart move. However, we shall have to wait and see how matters unfold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When responding to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, the Minister said that he was now attempting to put matters right. I hope that our discussion of the measure in Committee will enable the Minister or whoever represents the United Kingdom, with our European partners, at the review conference on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which starts in New York on 24 April, to say that we are starting to make progress, although I do not know what explanation will be given for having taken so long to get to this stage. However, I support the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Keetch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hereford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Mrs Roe, that it is a delight to be here this morning, and that I, too, hope that it will be for only a short time? We supported the Bill in the other place and on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) referred to the closure motion. The Government were right to move it because the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst clearly had other things on his mind. That became clear on Second Reading, so we supported the closure motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to my comments during that debate and my four specific questions. Britain has a long and proud history of taking the lead in agreements on nuclear non-proliferation. We received excellent news from the Russian Duma last Friday of their ratification of START 2 and this is an appropriate time to be discussing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I asked about the role of Gibralter and the colonies, the additional training of justices of the peace, the Bill's apparent lack of remedy for citizens and its use in our negotiations with the United States on their national missile defence programme. I hope that those issues will arise during our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Nuclear Safeguards Bill [	<i>Lords,</i>]the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we commence our proceedings on the Bill, I remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be reached during an afternoon sitting. No amendments have so far been tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>INFORMATION AND RECORDS FOR PURPOSES OF THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a short contribution on one of the most important clauses in the Bill, but before doing so I must express my surprise that the hon. Member who represents the Liberal party in the Committee is in favour of closure motions on Second Readings before 10 o'clock. That is an interesting development, which the Government will no doubt support enthusiastically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keech</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To correct the hon. Gentleman, I am the Liberal Democrat spokesman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand suitably chastened by that rebuke and accept it entirely, but it is interesting that there was no denial that the Liberal Democrats will support such a procedure in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the Bill's key clauses and at first glance seems straightforward. It places in the hands of the Secretary of State the power to require people within the United Kingdom and our colonies to give relevant information unrestricted by any obligation on confidentiality or limit on disclosure. The Government, rightly, expect such information to be given voluntarily, but if it is not, the Secretary of State will be able to serve notice on people, backed by criminal sanctions for non-compliance. I am tempted to say that I bet that the Secreatry of State wishes that he had such powers in relation to BMW and Rover. I shall not advance that point any further, Mrs Roe, because you would rightly rule me out of order, but it is a tempting line of investigation for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not clarify the range of persons, installations and institutions to which the clause will apply, nor was that clarified on Second Reading on 10 April. I understand from article 2 paragraph 1 of the protocol that the United Kingdom is required to supply the International Atomic Energy Agency with
	<br><blockquote><p>information specifying the location of those nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities that are funded, specifically authorised or controlled by, or carried on behalf of the United Kingdom.</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading, I asked the Minister about the range of installations that are likely to be affected by the record-keeping requirements of clause 2, but he was unable to answer. I do not blame hime for that: a closure motion was slammed on to the proceedings, preventing the Opposition spokesman from summing up our case and the Minister from satisfying everyone with what would no doubt have been a witty and erudite conclusion. The new game in town is that Second Readings are to be truncated by closure motions. I am sure that the Liberal Democrats will enthusiastically support those moves whenever they take place. Having asked the question again, I hope that the Minister can answer it when he responds to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
I also commented on the cost burdens that may be placed on universities and businesses, whether large or small. The way in which the matter of costs has been handled is part of the Government's attitude to businesses, which is not so much arrogance as indifference. When questioned about it, the Government spokesman in the House of Lords said that the costs involved would be just a few thousand pounds. To a small business, a few thousand pounds could be a make or break amount leading to its collapse. Unfortunately, that cavalier approach to placing burdens on smaller businesses runs through the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister was kind enough to ask me to name a number of firms that have
	<br><blockquote><p>complained about the onerous burden that he so beautifully describes—[	<i>Offical Report,</i> 10 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 45.]</p></blockquote>
It was ironic that he should ask me that question, because so far I have received no answers to mine. The regulatory burden and associated costs that will fall on universities and manufacturing companies are as yet unknown. How can they complain about a requirement of which they do not yet know the size and quantity? Most, if not all, of them are blissfully unaware of the new regime that is to descend on them and under which they will have to work. When they are informed of the recording procedures that they will have to adopt or amend, I predict that they may complain. When that happens, I hope that the Government will not be as deaf as they have so far been to comments that are made on behalf of such organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) provides a defence of "a reasonable excuse", which begs the question of the definition of "reasonable". That question also arose during consideration of the Postal Services Bill, and so far no satisfactory answer has been given. I hope that the Minister can explain what the defence of "a reasonable excuse" will mean. Does it imply—unlikely as it may seem to the parliamentary draftsmen and civil servants in the Department—that a person who has not been informed of the record-keeping requirements in the Bill, on which the Department will presumably be responsible for offering guidance, will have a defence in law? Will the onus of establishing that such guidance has been offered lie on the Department? Will the Department have to go out to everybody and tell them what its requirements will be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is an obligation on the Government to supply the Committee with answers. I hope that my natural suspicions are wrong and that the Minister can provide adequate answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Mrs Roe, though you must be sick of hearing it, that it is very nice to see you again in this room? I do not know how we will manage over Easter without you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, much of the information that this country will be obliged to give to the agency will already be available to the Government. Much of the information not already known to them will be obtained from major nuclear companies such as BNFL,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
AEA Technology and Urenco, which are expected to co-operate fully, as they have under the 1976 safeguards agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining information will be required from businesses performing certain highly specialised nuclear-related activities and from businesses or academic institutions carrying out relevant research and development activities. All the businesses and institutions that we are aware of that are carrying out such activities have been consulted on the proposals in the Bill and have indicated their support. I hope that that gives some comfort to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. It is expected that, in practice, most of the information that the agency requires from the UK will be given to the Government voluntarily by those who have it and that formal notices under the clause will rarely be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the cost of the new measures to small business. Only companies that engage in specialised activities, such as the manufacture of nuclear fuel cycle components or associated research and development, will be caught by the measures. Such companies have told us that they fully understand that the measures in the additional protocol are necessary and they have indicated their support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked what constitutes a reasonable excuse. It depends on the circumstances. That is why the defence is in general terms and does not attempt to guess in advance what might be a good reason for not complying with a notice. Reasonable excuses might be, "Our records were destroyed in a fire, which we did not cause," or "The notice requiring the information did not reach me," although there could be some dispute about that. It would be for the court to decide whether the excuse was true and reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>RIGHTS OF ACCESS ETC. FOR AGENCY INSPECTORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is eminently reasonable that I should comment on the clause, because it is perhaps the most contentious and worrying part of the Bill. One wonders whether some gold-plating or going over the top has occurred and whether one of the aspects included in it should not be subject to amendment. I was rather disappointed that I did not receive notification yesterday that the Government had tabled an amendment to the clause, relating to the monitoring of the behaviour and activities of any of the agency's inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause constitutes the second element of the Bill, and will give inspectors designated by the International Atomic Energy Agency the right to enter certain locations in accordance with the provisions of the additional protocol. Such inspectors will be able to conduct in those places specific activities that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
additional protocol requires. Their primary aim will be to check the information that the United Kingdom has provided to the agency. Should access not be granted voluntarily, it would be a criminal offence to obstruct the IAEA inspectors carrying out their duties or to interfere with anything that they might place on the land during the course of their inspection. I am not sure what such items might be; perhaps they might include monitoring equipment. No doubt the Minister will thumb through his file and discover what items might be left on the land with which it would be a criminal offence to interefere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government rightly expect the visits to be made mainly to the sites of the major nuclear companies in the United Kingdom. Oddly enought, the Minister said on that famous Second Reading that all those companies had expressed their support for the new measures. However, when asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) to name any public bodies outside the nuclear industry that supported the powers to be granted under the clause, all the Minister could say was that the Government had received no objections from any manufacturing company or individual. Was he using the negative resolution procedure on the representations from those bodies, or had they all faithfully written in to say that they supported the new measures?

Of course the major nuclear companies will tell the Department that they are willing to allow the IAEA inspectors in. They could hardly say anything else. However—to return to a point that I made during our debate on clause 2—whether any companies outside this magic circle have been consulted is an issue to which the Government have only partially responded. I shall tease the Minister again to give me more comfort that all the players in the game have been contacted, that they have all written in to express their burning enthusiasm for the measures in the protocol, and that they are all quite happy about the cost of a few thousand pounds here and there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can clarify what kind of companies he has in mind? I have already made it clear that there will be companies directly involved—perhaps in uranium enrichment or in centrifugal devices for separation. What other kinds of companies does he think that the inspectors might wish to examine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, universities spring to mind as a typical example. As we know, several universities carry out research into nuclear activities. I should be happy to give way to the Minister if he can tell us that all the universities have been contacted and are happy about the few thousand pounds that is to be added to their costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have certainly contacted all the universities in which we know that such research and development is being carried out. We have received no objections from any of them. They understand that no shadow should be cast across their work, because it is important for them to maintain a reputation for legality in all things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understand why the Government regard clause 5 as an essential part of the Bill. The Conservative party, and possibly also the Liberal Democrats, regard it as such. However, I cannot understand—nor, I am sure, can any impartial observer—why the Government are so confident that the proposal does not breach the European convention on human rights. One cannot argue that agency inspectors must have rights of access to information, subject to the conditions that are provided by the additional protocol, and then make the sort of concessions that Lord McIntosh of Haringey made in another place on 13 December and on 24 January. He said that the Government expected that there would be challenges in the courts to the power of IAEA inspectors to enter business premises or homes without a warrant granted by the justice of the peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Bill that is brought before the House in the expectation that one of its fundamental provisions will be challenged in the courts is a constitutional novelty. New Labour's approach may mean no legal protection for UK citizens until a test case has been determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital for the Minister to clarify the situation. I do not believe that the clause's provisions offer much reassurance to hon. Members or to those who may be subject to the provisions. The fact that the agency's inspectors are envisaged as having unrestricted rights of entry to premises and homes in the UK is excessive. I hope that the Government will table an amendment on Report to clarify the situation and to ensure that there will be no challenge in the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Simpson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his remarks? We need to balance the need to give inspectors powers of intrusion for inspection purposes against the benefits of having an international verification regime, which is at the core of our common safety. Does he agree that verification is central to most, if not all, of the international negotiations that the UK is involved in, in the nuclear club and with the non-nuclear world? That, rather than considerations involving micro-costs or intrusions into domestic premises, is the overriding issue around which global security has to be determined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We fully support the protocol's aims and objectives, but there is a danger that it suggests that the end justifies the means. We must have a right of access—inspectors must be able to verify throughout the length and breadth of the land—but I have queries about the procedures that regulate the way in which inspectors work. Search warrants can be used to allow police constables to search and to investigate premises, people, companies and buildings, and there is a procedure whereby their use is authorised. A police constable goes to a magistrate and explains why the warrant is necessary. The warrant may be granted, and the process is duly authorised by law. However, the proposal in this case is to allow people whom we do not know or mominate into our properties, our premises and our houses without let or hindrance. While they must be given the right of access, the process whereby they obtain that right should be more closely examined. I hope that when the Minister responds he will not say, "It happens in other areas, so it must be all right here." Two wrongs do not make a third right. We should look at the previous two measures that allow unfettered
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
rights of access and bring this provision more into line with our laws, our rules and our country, instead of allowing unfettered access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (4) and (5) provide for authorised officers or constables to accompany agency inspectors on a permissive basis, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson) for giving me the opportunity to expand on this point. Officers and constables should accompany the inspectors as a rule and not on the basis of "I'm free this afternoon. I might go with this inspector if he would like a bit of company." If it is not done by rule, the provisions are largely redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made it clear on Second Reading, when he did a splendid job in going through the clauses and some of the Bill's weaknesses, that the inspectors should not face challenges to their status and authority when conducting inspections. If there is a dispute over their activities, it will be too late for the Secretary of State to rush along with a certificate, belatedly found and signed, to confirm that they are operating legitimately. Those who find themselves subject to inspections will want to know that the agency's inspectors are properly authorised and fully prepared to respect their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and hon. Friends would have liked answers to a number of questions on Second Reading. I am sorry that the Minister was deprived of the opportunity to wind up for a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes. Our concerns are genuine and important. I know that he will give them a serious response, but I also hope that he will table a suitable amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire described the clause, which is central to the Bill, as excessive and said that it granted unfettered access to the IAEA. My noble Friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire said that it was a most draconian measure. Indeed it is, but is is right that it should be, because we are seeking to apply in other parts of the world something that applies here. If we are not excessive and draconian in the UK in allowing international inspection of our nuclear plants, we cannot expect other countries to be excessive and draconian in allowing international inspections of theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the JPs are satisfied that agency inspectors should be accompanied by a constable, especially if the inspection results in damage to property or loss of business and is then found to be in order, what remedy will the British citizen, university or company have against the Government, the IAEA or the police authority that accompanied the inspector? The Minister should explain the practicalities in a little more detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to endorse the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire. Certain subsections in clause 4 begin with the phrase.
	<br><blockquote><p>If a justice of the peace is satisfied …</p></blockquote>

That is a clear reference to a long-standing judicial figure who enjoys the confidence of the public. That is in marked contrast to the measures in clause 5, which the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) described as draconian. Draco is the much-maligned tyrant of Athens, who believed in keeping decisions local. The Bill is confusing the principle that the end justifies the means with a major breach in a long-standing tradition of British law that reaches back to Magna Carta. Private property is sacrosanct, and only a representative of the law with a warrant issued by a judicial figure such as a magistrate should be allowed to enter it. Allowing agencies from outside this country to send in personnel without reference to any British legal authority is a wrong and ill-thought-out idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. The Shropshire representative of the Marches perhaps knows his classical history better than the Herefordshire representative. However, he should bear in mind one point. If we do not allow international inspectors full access to our civil nuclear plants, how can we urge Libya, Iraq, Iran and North Korea to to the same? Whether those countries in fact grant such access is, in a sense, irrelevant. If we start from a position of denying access, how can be expect them to grant it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important misunderstanding of what I have just said. I did not say that agencies of the IAEA should be prevented from investigating estbalishments with all speed. I simply said that the authority of a justice of the peace should be required. Clause 4, which uses the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>If a justice of the peace is satisfied, on information on oath,</p></blockquote>
makes that requirement clear. I am not saying that people who are clearly experts in this matter should not be allowed into this country, and I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument: if we do not grant such authority, we cannot make similar demands of rogue states. However, that is another debate—we are considering civil nuclear installations, not military ones. It is essential that anyone who is sent into any house in this country be required to have a legal warrant issued by, at minimum, a justice of the peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Colman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the nub of the Bill. In Iraq, for reasons that have been discussed today, prior notice is given, but that enables removal of any evidence by the time of the United Nations inspectors' arrival, it is important to recognise the problems associated with the current situation, which the additional protocol is attempting to remedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing entry into United Kingdom establishments and setting a precedent for the future; we have no legal jurisdiction in respect of Iraq. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the Iraqi regime will pay any attention to our deliberations, he is being naïve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Colman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was following the point made by the hon. Member for Hereford. I assume that we want rogue states to sign up to the additional protocol. If so, we cannot require a warrant from a justice of the peace in this country without expecting a similar arrangement to apply in rogue states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the hon. Gentleman is contradicted by clause 4, which demands the involvement of a justice of the peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a police constable or inspector requests a search warrant from a magistrate, they do not ring up the premises to say, "By the way, we're coming round at 4 o'clock in the afternoon to conduct a search". It is carried out secretly, in confidence, without the knowledge of the occupants. That is precisely what clause 4 stipulates. It is untenable for the hon. Member for Putney to try to extrapolate the argument in such a way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has eloquently made exactly the point that I was about to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intolerable that these powers should be given to an outside agency without any reference to a legal authority in this country. There is apparently no appeal system or recourse to law for any British citizen who feels aggrieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want briefly to refer to the European convention on human rights. When it was quoted on Second Reading, the Minister did not give an adequate response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not have the chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyement of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principle of international law.</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest.</p></blockquote>
I am not a lawyer, but clause 5 appears to be in breach of the convention. If that is so, what the Government's plan B?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite a few questions have been asked, and I shall do my best to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the closure motion, which was referred to several times, it would have taken much more than a quarter of an hour to answer all the questions that were put. I had 43 pages of them, most of which came from the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. The average speech lasted for an hour and five minutes, and we sat there for a total of five and a half hours. In fact, I learned a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the initial questions of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. He asked what types of activities agency inspectors will conduct on their visits. The precise activities that may be conducted naturally depend on the location in question and the reason for the access. The hon. Gentleman cited the example of universities. He is rightly concerned—as am I—about guarding their tradition of academic freedom.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0849">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
However, some universities are engaged in very sensitive research—into nuclear technology or genetic engineering, for example—and will therefore be subject to inspection from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examples of activities that could be performed include visual observation, collection of environmental samples and the use of radiation detection and measurement devices. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked what would be left on the ground, and that would almost certainly include detection and measurement devices. Other activities could concern the application of seals—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Seals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not seals that swim in the sea—the securing of containers. The examination of records could be another example. The additional protocol also allows for other objective measures to be defined for future use if they have been demonstrated to be technically feasible and their use has been approved by the agency board of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether agency inspectors should always be accompanied by United Kingdom officials was raised by the hon. Members for South-West Hertfordshire and for North Shropshire. The Bill permits an authorised officer to accompany an agency inspector. However, it does not require it, nor does it specify when an authorised officer should or should not attend. In practice, it is left to the Department of Trade and Industry's safeguards office to decide whether and when it is necessary or appropriate to send somebody to accompany an inspector. The Bill has been drafted in this way for a number of good reasons, some of which have been touched on by hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if the Bill required the presence of an authorised officer at all times, the United Kingdom would risk being in breach of the additional protocol. Article 4.f. of the protocol provides that the United Kingdom's right to have agency inspectors accompanied must not delay or impede inspectors in the exercise of their functions, and an inspector could be impeded or delayed if he or she could not act without an authorised officer being present. That could be unavoidable in a short-notice inspection, when the period of notice may be two hours or less. Moreover, to require the presence of authorised officers at all times could, as my hon. Friend the Member for Putney and the hon. Member for Hereford said, set a precedent to rogue states, which they would certainly abuse by forcing inspectors seeking to access to locations to wait for a long time until an authorised officer became available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's detailed answers, but a rogue state will not allow inspectors unfettered access even if the matter is going through its own legal system. In Iraq, the back-up of considerable force was necessary to enable the inspections to take place. The idea that a rogue state that is misbehaving will let inspectors roam free is disingenuous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is putting a good case for doing away with JPs signing search warrants, because the police
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
could argue "I want to conduct a search quickly. It will take more than two hours to get a warrant, so I will go ahead with the search. Otherwise we will lose out." That is the argument that he is putting to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly not the argument that I am trying to put to the Committee. As the hon. Member for North Shropshire said, the rules are specific in other parts of the Bill. In a case of short notice, it would be physically impossible to have to wait for a warrant. That is why we need the flexibility in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Iraq is the only country so far where this issue has blown up into a huge political question. Indeed, its status as a rogue state has been reinforced and highlighted as a result of its unwillingness to allow inspectors access to the most sensitive parts of its arms industry. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire knows that countries such as Iran and even Libya have been much more co-operative in allowing international inspectors to see their facilities. That has identified Iraq as one of the very few countries that are not prepared to allow it to happen. As the hon. Member for Hereford said, it would leave us in an embarrassing position if, at the same time as calling for inspections to be allowed in Iraq, for example, we said that we would not allow them in our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned Iraq. Does he agree that the Iraqi regime has been expert in identifying discordant voices, even within the Minister's own party, and using that as propaganda in its efforts to prevent the UNSCOM inspectors from doing their job correctly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is wrong for us to construe the importance of the Bill in terms of whether it would apply in Iraq? It is essential that the United Kingdom, as a nuclear power, is seen to be taking a lead in ensuring that the best standards of scrutiny and inspection apply within the nuclear club, so that the legitimate fears and misgivings of all those nations that are not part of the club can be addressed. By doing that, we will create a benchmark for acceptable standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. The atmosphere of secrecy was one of the great problems inherited by BNFL, and for a long time it prevented inspections of plutonium and enriched uranium facilities at the site. It contributed to a kind of Quatermass reputation that has been almost impossible to throw off, despite the fact that inspectors can now go to any part of the BNFL and, indeed, have been able to go to the site at Sellafield for a long time. That is a tribute to the previous Government for their recognition that such openness was vital if we were to show the rest of the world, including some of our closest allies, such as the Republic of Ireland, that we had nothing to hide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for North Shropshire and for South-West Hertfordshire asked about the European convention on human rights, which is crucial to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
issue, and the former even quoted from it. We are concerned that the civil liberties should not be infringed and we have considered the provisions in the Bill carefully. We are satisfied that they do not infringe civil liberties and that they are consistent with our obligations under the European convention on human rights. In particular, we have considered the compatibility of clause 5 with the convention, in the light of the debate on that clause, both in the house of Lords and on the Second Reading. I do not want to get involved in complex legal arguments, and I am sure that no one else does, but, as a question has been raised about the compatibility of the clause with the convention, I will go, briefly, into further detail about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no requirement in clause 5—unlike clauses 4 and 8—that a warrant be issued before access to premises is sought. A requirement to obtain a warrant is considered to be an appropriate control on the exercise of a general power to enter premises, particularly a power to search for items or information or to collect evidence for possible use in a prosecution. Clauses 4 and 8 contain general search powers of that sort, which is why the powers can be exercised only on the granting of a warrant. Clause 5 does not provide a power to enter premises and conduct a search, nor does it provide a power to enter premises and carry out activities defined in general terms. The agency's rights as covered by clause 5 relate only to the entering of premises to conduct certain tightly defined activities. That is the key point. Under clause 5, it is not considered that a warrant is necessary or appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered whether that interpretation is consistent with the convention. The key article—I cannot remember whether it was quoted by the hon. Member for North Shropshire—is article 8. It States:
	<br><blockquote><p>Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman will tell me whether that is the article that he quoted. It also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</p></blockquote>
That point has already been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article is relevant because, although it is very unlikely, it is possible, at least in theory, that the powers in clause 5 may have to be exercised on domestic premises. Committee members will recall that some of the most sensitive plants in Iraq were in Saddam Hussein's palaces, which were defined as domestic premises. Case law suggests that the term "home", which appears in the additional protocol, might encompass a professional person's office. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire pointed out on Second Reading that increasing numbers of professionals are working at home and that the key tool is the computer. To deny access to computer records, which may be crucial in relation to, for example, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
sale of part of a nuclear trigger mechanism, would be folly indeed. We are satisfied that it is necessary in a democratic society to allow entry in the circumstances and for the purposes that are describe in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hereford asked about remedies for the misuse of powers. If an authorised officer of the Secretary of State exceeded his or her powers, he or she would be acting unlawfully and open to legal challenge in the usual way. The appropriate form of legal proceedings would depend on what had happened. Judicial review or a claim for compensation might be involved. If an IAEA inspector acted beyond his or her powers, that too, would be unlawful, and the United Kingdom would complain strongly to the agency. Agency inspectors are covered by a form of diplomatic immunity, and neither they nor the agency would normally be subject to legal proceedings. If an inspector exceeded his or her powers in a serious manner or in a way that had serious consequences—such cases were discussed by the hon. Member for Hereford—we would need to establish whether the agency should waive immunity in that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be specific. If an inspector came into a premises in my constituency and caused damage or prevented a business from trading for a couple of hours, the agency would be covered by diplomatic immunity. How would my constituent get money to pay for the repair of a lock or computer equipment, or for the loss of the morning's activities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He or she could challenge along the lines that I described earlier—namely, because the inspector's activities were unwarranted. The inspector may have acted outside his or her remit and, therefore, acted illegally. There is no remedy for damage that is caused by an inspector who properly exercises the powers. In view of the type of activities that the inspectors are permitted to carry out, such damage is most unlikely to occur. In other words, the hon. Gentleman was discussing exceptional circumstances. I cannot think of similar instances in other legislation, except when company investigations are carried out because there have been allegations of distortions of markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us take the practical example of an inspector who goes into a business in Hereford or Shropshire. The Minister said that most of the relevant information would be on computer. The inspector would be within his rights to remove the computer. By doing so, he might damage the business, which would means that there would be a claim against the inspector. Who would resolve that claim?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ultimately, the courts will do so, as per normal. In the unlikely event that the provisions have to be used, there is no specific remedy for damage unless the person claims that inspectors acted outside their remit. If they found on the computer that illegal activities were taking place, and that subterfuge was involved, serious criminal proceedings, or some action to prevent that activity from going any further would, follow.

11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered all the questions on this difficult issue. Half the answer is that these powers are hardly ever likely to be used. We cannot find a case since 1976 under the existing legislation, and we are unlikely to have to use the powers in the future. However, they are necessary because of the circumstances in other countries. We are dealing with a great many countries, not just with the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's reply sadly inadequate. Despite the support that he has received from the Liberal Democrats, I believe that we are throwing away a long-standing principle of British law for the sake of obtaining a very dubious bargaining chip with states such as Iraq that have no respect for the law or for outside agencies of any kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not satisfactorily answered our questions concerning the gross infringement of the right of British citizens not to have their private property entered without an agent having the full authority of at least a justice of the peace and the correct warrant. That has been a tradition in this country that has worked extremely well. It is not worth throwing away that tradition for the sake of obtaining a dubious and debased bargaining chip to use in international negotiations with rogue states that have no regard for the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what my hon. Friend has said. When the Minister reads his words later, he will understand the disquiet that he has raised among Opposition Committee members by saying that he is sure that an inspector would not seriously exceed his powers. If those powers were seriously exceeded, there would appear to be virtually no redress. Therefore, I regret to say that if the Minister cannot give us some assurance that he will provide clarification on Report, I must register a vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have concerns, especially about the remedy issue. I hope that the Minister will come back to us with more evidence on Report. I am concerned about what might happen if any of our constituents should be investigated by an international body, although I am happy that that body should have access and that that should be gained in the way prescribed in the clause. If my constituent were found to be innocent, but had nevertheless sustained damage to his or her property or business, the question of a remedy in those circumstances must be examined. We shall seek further clarification on that matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as I can. I have a slight dilemma because I am trying to reconcile the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire said, being draconian is somehow allied with subsidiarity. I am not yet able to make that intellectual jump, but I shall work on it and perhaps come up with an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is necessary to protect information that can be gathered under the Bill or the additional protocol. Except in specifically prescribed circumstances, it will be an offence for certain information to be disclosed and the Bill sets out the penalties for such disclosure. Civil servants who deal with the information to be passed to the International Atomic Energy Agency were comforted to learn from the Minister last week that the clause is aimed primarily at them. Budding Sir Humphreys should note that their political masters cannot be trusted to protect them at all times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there will be circumstances in which information may be disclosed. If a criminal offence is alleged to have been committed under other clauses, information will inevitably have to be made available to the Crown Prosecution Service and to any court proceedings. The judicial system could not work in any other way. On the other side of the coin, what happens if the criminal proceedings fail? How can companies or individuals seek compensation or redress if they are found not guilty of misconduct concerning information that was made public during proceedings? An advantage may accrue to competitors of some of our major nuclear companies or to rivals of smaller manufacturing companies. If there is no means of redress, the consequences could be very damaging commercially and I wonder whether the Minister has considered that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman was a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry and, probably every morning, handled market-sensitive files dealing with mergers and takeovers, and containing information on which advice was sought from the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopoly and Mergers Commission, which is now the Competition Commission. The Government have a lot of experience in handling market-sensitive information. Redress is available, usually through judicial review, and I have no information that there will be a change in companies' ability to seek proper redress if their confidentiality has been abused or an unfair advantage has been given to rivals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the hon. Gentleman to realise that companies must trust the Government and that the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
Government have a duty to ensure that that trust is not only encouraged, but maintained. The Government could not operate otherwise and the Department of Trade and Industry could not operate if it was not capable of doing justice. If a company wanted information to remain private during a trial, it would have to ask the judge. That is the position now and will remain so under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has reassured me with the answer, "Trust me, I'm a politician." I go along with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not expand on this clause. As I said on Second Reading, it enables the extension of the Bill's provisions to the colonies, and the Minister will remember my slightly tongue-in-cheek comments in that regard.

It has been a privilege to serve under your chairmanship Mrs Roe. If it were possible for me to contract you to chair other Standing Committees on which I shall serve, I would be only too happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse those comments—it has been a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mrs Roe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should declare an interest. In the past year, I visited Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands, which are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
dependent territories, as a guest of their Governments. How does the Minister distinguish between a colongy and a dependent territory? Does the Bill regard them as the same thing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (4) will enable the Bill and the Act that implements the safeguards agreement to be applied by Order in Council, with appropriate modifications, to
	<br><blockquote><p>the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or any colony.</p></blockquote>
According to the Interpretation Act 1978, the word "colony" has a standard meaning. Such orders may be necessary if any activity within the scope of the additonal protocol or the safeguards agreement is carried on in any of those territories. The existence of that power would not prevent any of the islands or territories from passing their own relevant legislation, if that were considered appropriate. Indeed, some have already said that they would prefer to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the hon. Member for Hereford, I can confirm that, under subseciton (4), the provisions in the Bill can be extended to Gibraltar by Order in Council. The purpose of the Bill is to require information on activities relevant to the additional protocol; it does not deal with the way in which information is placed in the public domain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
