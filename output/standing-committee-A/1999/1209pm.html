	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 934, in page 184, line 15, after 'corporate' insert—
	<br><q><p>'(other than an open-ended investment company)'.</p></q>
The amendment raises an important drafting point, and relates to subsection (3), which defines "manager" as someone who manages part of the business. That definition relates to the body corporate. However, if the body corporate is an open-ended investment company, its manager is the external firm managing its assets. When the Bill refers to the manager of an open-ended investment company or OEIC—as the investment services directive does—it should be clear that it does not mean a manager in the sense given in subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment. I agree that the clause is designed to specify who a firm's managers should be. However, the amendment is unnecessary because "manager" is not used in relation to an open-ended investment company. Part XVI refers to the operators of an OEIC—not their manager—and the term "manager" is not used in relation to OEICS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the term "manager" is used in relation to unit trusts, hence the exclusion of unit trusts from the definition in clause 357. I hope that that persuades the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. On the basis of her explanation, I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment. If there is any confusion, the record will show what is meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>CONSEQUENTIAL AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 935, in page 185, line 13, after 'they', insert 'reasonably'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 936, in page 185, line 14, leave out 'or expedient'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1252</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 935 is another instance of our old friend, "reasonable". It would make a simple insertion in relation to the discretionary power to make supplementary provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 936 would delete "expedient", as the word means helpful, and gives the Treasury wide discretion to include extra provisions that are not restricted by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendment would insert in the Bill the Opposition's long-running desire to debate the notion of reasonableness. We have already discussed the use of that term. However, we have said that we shall consider in more detail the requirement for the FSA to be reasonable in its undertakings. The amendment concerns the Treasury and how it may make consequential and supplementary provisions. At present it is for the Treasury to decide whether an order is necessary or expedient. The provision will enable the Treasury to act promptly when the need arises and to make sure that it is doing what is right and appropriate in the circumstances. To stipulate that the Treasury should consider whether something is reasonable and necessary is to miss two points; first, that in reaching a decision the Treasury would be likely to consider whether it was reasonable and weigh up such factors as an adverse affect on millions of people; secondly, the Treasury may sometimes need to take decisions that are, in some people's eyes, unreasonable. Taking into account, and acting upon, the possible concerns of such groups would leave the Treasury unable to act quickly or rationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "expedient", with which amendment No. 936 is concerned, is part of a standard legislative phrase which confers on the Treasury powers to make regulations amending other legislation. That will be necessary to bring the Bill into force effectively. I do not believe that we should remove the phrase "or expedient" from the clause, as that would undermine the Treasury's carrying out of its functions under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some big issues arise, which we should perhaps deal with in a brief clause stand part debate. The Government are clearly not inclined to accept either of our amendments. The clause gives the Treasury substantial power to rewrite the whole Bill—a provision that we felt needed tightening a little. We shall not press the amendments to a vote, but we should like to put the larger issues on the record. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Tyrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a quite extraordinary clause. I should be grateful if Labour Members would have a look at it, rather than doing their correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household (Mr. Graham Allen)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit late for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman's comment; it is a very late clause. It means that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1253</span>
have all been wasting our time. A clause that just said "Let's have some financial regulation", followed by the clause that we are considering, would have done the trick very nicely, coupled with an explanatory note about the Government's intentions. The clause gives the Treasury powers virtually to rewrite the Bill from top to bottom. It goes far too wide and our amendments only scratch the surface of what is required. I believe that the Committee has accepted 440 amendments, six of which were tabled by the Opposition. That was out of a total of 970 amendments that were tabled, as well as 18 new clauses. We have had 35 sittings and 100 hours work on the Bill. On no fewer than 63 occasions—I counted—Ministers have agreed to give further attention to other parts of the Bill, in addition to the amendments that I have mentioned. Why on earth have we been doing all this work if, whenever the Treasury feels like it, it can just alter the Bill at will?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing that I felt I needed to discover in response to the clause was whether such a provision existed in the Financial Services Act 1986. After all, if the Government and previous Administrations have carried on in this way in the past, perhaps I should not be so concerned about it. Incidentally, lest any hon. Member should feel that I am over-egging things, it is important to read the clause. It states that the Treasury may "by order"—that is by negative resolution—
	<br><q><p>"make such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental provision as they consider necessary or expedient for the general purposes, or any particular purpose, of this Act".</p></q>
Not content with that, in subsection (4) we find:—
	<br><q><p>"No other provision of this Act restricts the powers conferred by this section."</p></q>
In other words, the licence is to do exactly what the Treasury wishes. That is why it is worth examining the 1986 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1986 Act also enables the Treasury to vary the provisions, but it is far more tightly circumscribed than what is before us in the Bill. For example, section 2 gives the Secretary of State the power to alter, by order, "the meaning of investment" in schedule 1. However, anyone reading the Act can see that the power is much narrower than in clause 361 as it applies to one specific aspect and deals only with legitimate transitional concerns. Other sections of the 1986 Act have a similar effect. For example, delegation orders can be made under section 114, which allows transitional and supplementary provision to be made in connection with a delegation order. The sub-heading to the section describes the provisions as transitional and supplementary measures and they are designed to deal with the transition and the creation of new legislation during which some bedding down and transitional effects may be relevant. By contrast, clause 361 makes provisions that will be on the statute book—end are intended for use—indefinitely, and that is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second major concern is how the courts might interpret clause 361(1), and I would be grateful to hear the views of my right hon. and learned Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1254</span>
Minister for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), Words such as incidental, consequential, transitional and supplemental could be interpreted narrowly by the courts, and that would restrict Treasury discretion under the clause to some extent. But what about the term "general purposes"? I was unable to find it in previous legislation, so why does it appear here? It could be deemed broad enough to include anything in the long title of the Bill. If so, might that not lead to further amendments having to be made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify her interpretation of "general purposes", as that would greatly assist the courts when the provisions came up for judicial review? Will she explain the wide scope of the clause, which seems to cover every topic that we have debated—for 100 hours, as I said? Will she also explain why we need on the statute book a provision that is clearly not a transitional measure, unlike similar clauses in previous legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, Mr. O'Brien, whether you ever met Henry VIII, but this is one of his clauses. They may not be familiar now, but I have a nasty feeling that they might become so. I doubt whether the Minister will be able to enlighten us, but I am sure that these Henry VIII clauses exist on a word processor somewhere in the office of the Treasury or the parliamentary draftsman. All it takes to put such a clause into a Bill is one tap on one key and in it goes. The ghost of Henry VIII may be stalking the Chamber, but one does not need ghosts. If anyone wants to know what ukase means, it is how Boris Yeltsin governments in Russia. It simply means diktat or decree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would enable the Treasury by order—one might as well say by ukase, diktat or decree—to change the Bill at will if it regards it as expedient for the general purposes or any particular purpose of the Bill. Do the Government really intend to hand the Treasury the power to alter this carefully crafted legislation—or so they would have us believe—immediately, simply by laying an order before the House? Could the Minister clarify that by order simply means subject to negative resolution and that the order simply has to be laid to come into force? I should know the answer to this question but I do not: can the order be reversed on a prayer to a negative resolution should the House decide to reverse it? It ought to be the case and I believe that it is but I have a nagging worry that it may not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to the point highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) concerning the phrase—
	<br><q><p>"incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental provision".</p></q>
I do not have much difficulty with "incidental, consequential" and "transitional". They all seem perfectly sensible ways of modifying a large piece of legislation such as this, but "supplemental" should put us on our guard. If the provisions simply supplement what can be done in a small way or if they tweak and make necessary changes or changes in practice that are within the spirit of the Bill, I have no problem with them, and nor does the Committee, I suspect.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1255</span>
However, if supplemental provisions mean that the Treasury, or the Financial Services Agency acting via the Treasury, can simply add to the enormous powers of the Bill in any way consistent with the long title merely by laying an order, it goes too far. I should be grateful for clarification on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Beard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bexleyheath and Crayford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In normal English, the word supplemental would never bear the second interpretation that the right hon. and learned Gentleman puts on it. That would be virtually amendment and replacement. Supplemental, by the nature of the word, means minor adjustments and adaptations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can recognise a sensible man when one hears one. I would agree with the hon. Gentleman that that is what it ought to mean. I ask him to lay a fiver on the desk to indicate his confidence that the Minister will say exactly the same as him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such a wager could be regulated under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the Bill is not yet law, but I shall be glancing in the hon. Gentleman's direction to see whether that fiver slips on to the desk in the few moments before I complete my speech. I see that the Financial Secretary is looking around to see whether it is there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(a) states that the order may make provision—
	<br><q><p>"for enabling any person … on a date set by or under this Act, by virtue of any provision made by or under this Act to take before that date any steps that are necessary as a preliminary to the exercise of those powers."</p></q>
Therefore, one does not have to wait for the order and can start frightening people off even before it has been tabled in the Public Bill Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like some examples in relation to subsection (2)(b), which states that an order may, in particular, make provision—
	<br><q><p>"for making savings, or additional savings, from the effect of any repeal made by or under this Act."</p></q>
That suggests that this ukase, diktat, Henry VIII clause could, simply by means of an order, alter not only the Bill, but previous Acts of Parliament. Those might have been wholly or partly repealed, which might be considered inconvenient. Therefore, we are changing not just the Bill, but past legislation. Is that really what the clause means? If so, could I have two or three simple examples of when something similar has been done so that we can set our minds at rest and see that we are talking about a sensible rather than an overweening use of power?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does subsection (3) mean? It states:—
	<br><q><p>"Amendments made under this section are additional, and without prejudice, to those made by or under any other provision of this Act."</p></q>
What do the words "without prejudice to" mean? That phrase is normally misused on the top of so-called legal letters. I cannot recall it having been used in legislation in precisely the way that it is used in the Bill? Does it mean that the amendments cannot be construed together with other provisions of the Bill or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1256</span>
of relevant legislation? If so, that might have curious results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) states:—
	<br><q><p>"No other provision of this Act restricts the powers conferred by this section."</p></q>
What does that mean in terms of the long-standing sui generis rule for the construction of statutes? According to that rule, one construes provisions in an Act in a way that is consistent with what has gone before in that Act. That was very much in the mind of the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) when he made the point that he is shortly to back with his fiver. Does subsection (4) mean that the sui generis rule has gone out of the window as regards the Bill's construction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is an extraordinarily wide Henry VIII clause, and the points that I raised should be addressed before we can agree to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I throw in my threepennyworth—or even five pounds' worth—as we reach the Bill's climatic stages?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend is far more versed than I am in the legal technicalities of the wording of such Bills. However, one does not need to be that experienced to know that this is a complete catch-all clause. The previous 360 clauses and 16 schedules—everything that we have argued about, amended and want to achieve—could be completely undermined by clause 361.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend mentioned a computer somewhere in the Treasury basement that contained the Henry VIII clauses. It probably has the equivalent of a spellcheck button, and the instant one presses it, the Henry VIII clause appears. It is 552 years since the death of Henry VIII, although when we started, it was 551 years. However, his spirit is alive, well and increasingly kicking in this and other legislation. The Bill is no ordinary bit of legislation, as you, Mr. O'Brien, and anyone else who has sat in the Chair will quickly have discovered. It is highly complex, highly technical and exceedingly important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The thrust of the clause is that so many of the provisions that we have discussed could be overturned. For example, the Government may determine, for their general purposes as set out in the clause, that the competitiveness principle is no longer required even as a principle because it may be rather cumbersome, although we have argued for elevating it to an objective. The Government may decide under the powers in the clause that the whole split between the FSA's investigative and prosecutory procedures that have been so much at the heart of all our arguments for so many weeks should be done away with. The independence of the tribunal for which we have argued so strongly could become something of an encumbrance. Indeed, the budget of the Lord Chancellor's Office, which will finance this part of the FSA's procedures, could be shrunk, therefore it would no longer be practical for it to operate in the ways that the Bill promised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Kidney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say whether, in deciding one of those cataclysmic changes, the court would accept that that was incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or expedient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or expedient, which remains in the clause. But it would be covered by general purposes, and how does one define them? Surely it is much better to have it clearly marked out in the Bill rather than having to court—which we have tried so often to avoid with these procedures—about precisely what the Government could and could not do without introducing primary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kidney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman under some misapprehension or are there alternatives beyond supplemental. If that is his reading of the clause, he is wrong. The first requirement is that the provision must be incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is plain wrong if he considers that there are alternatives to saying that a provision is necessary or expedient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All provisions are subject to being expedient for the general purposes. If the hon. Gentleman were right, he would have been happy for our amendment on the expediency line to have fallen. The point of all this is that the fundamental and basic arguments of recent weeks could still be overturned purely by triggering the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From a sedentary position, the Minister said that he felt that the phrase "expedient for the general purposes" implied a narrowing of the scope for altering the Bill. It is most important to have that on record because, as it stands, "general purposes" could mean almost anything, and a court would have great difficulty ruling a change out of order if it could be described as being for general purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister intended to imply—in the words of his colleague the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in Committee some weeks ago—that it is a tradition of such
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1258</span>
Committees that what is said here by Ministers takes precedence in law. We appreciate the Minister's comments, but there is some confusion as to what they constitute in terms of revisiting Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart.

To conclude, this is important future legislation that should not be subject, at the Government's whim, to secondary legislation by a reduction of the clause. It can be argued that some matters should be subject to the lesser scrutiny of the negative resolution procedure. We frequently amend the Baking and Sausage-Making (Christmas and New Year) Regulations 1985 or the Lawnmowers (Harmonisation of Noise Emission Standards) Regulations 1985. The Bill is in an altogether different league. One would have thought that at the end of these long deliberations and the almost equally long deliberations of the pre-scrutiny stages of the Bill, Ministers would at least want to tie down the clauses so that the Government would not be able to decide at a whim that something was not convenient because they determined that it was not expedient for the Bill's general purposes as they saw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely there has been an exaggeration. It is not possible to interpret the clause as giving powers to do such things as are necessary or expedient. The provisions, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) pointed out, are consequential, transitional or supplemental—all minor adjustments—that may be invoked expediency or necessity. The clause does not give powers to do generally such things as are necessary and expedient. That is the whole drift of the Opposition's attack, but it is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members seems to be getting into an awful muddle. I need to tell members of the Committee, in case it is thought that Opposition Members spent their lunch time adding up the figures, that I know for a fact that some figures were given to them by the Clerks, although they may have done one or two themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friends have been concerned about the inaccuracy of some of the other calculations that have been done, but there is also great inaccuracy in the rest. Some of the figures that hon. Gentlemans quoted were not their own handiwork and they did not spend their lunch time very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The number crunching was given to both sides of the Committee by the Clerks as we stood here immediately after lunch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Chichester for making my point for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford on his good sense and his ability to read the simple English of the Bill. It provides that the Treasury may make such regulations to make changes that are incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental to measures introduced in the Bill and which the Treasury considers either necessary or expedient. Necessity and expediency are governed by the earlier requirement that provisions be incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental. Many repeals and transitional and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1259</span>
consequential amendments will feature in schedules to the Bill, but we did not incorporate them when we introduced the Bill because they cannot by definition be finalised until the new arrangements are reasonably settled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman wishes to hear the answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady began to give an answer, I thought, but then started referring to the clauses and got into a bit of a muddle. Can she clarify whether she is saying, for Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart purposes, that expedience for the general purposes is extremely restricted, as her colleague said a short time ago from a sedentary position, and refers only to such matters as may already be incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I qualified the word "clauses" because I was referring to the earlier words and I thought that "clauses" in the Bill's context was unhelpful. That was why I reiterated the point slightly differently. "Expedient" must be read in the context of the preceding words:—
	<br><q><p>"incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental provision".</p></q>
In that context, the term "expedient" is designed to further the purpose of that as an—
	<br><q><p>"incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental provision".</p></q>
It was not designed to allow the Treasury to make orders in relation to a range of matters that are not linked to that primary purpose. Indeed, it cannot do that. Therefore, the Treasury is not given the power to rewrite the Bill. The hon. Gentlemans have not spent their lunchtime at all well because they have come back to Committee excited with several matters based on a poor understanding of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, hon. Gentlemans should remember that—in relation to general purposes—the Bill covers a wide range of matters. To attempt to identify its subject matter in anything other than a general manner would a recital of all its provisions. Opposition Members have spent some time saying how big the Bill is, how many amendments we have discussed and how long we have been here, so I am sure that they would not want to go through that. General purposes are simply a sensible approach to covering that which the Bill covers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly address the question of Henry VIII, who did not have a word processor. However, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire suggested that he did, and envisaged the clause spewing out into several measures. However, it is a standard way of dealing with issues, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows full well. There are many precedents for a provision of this nature. For example section 185(3) of the Companies Act 1989—which was passed when the Conservative party was in Government—allows the Secretary of State to make regulations that add to, amend or repeal any provisions of part VII of that Act, or provide that those provisions have effect, subject to any adaptation specified in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1260</span>
There are many legal precedents for the procedure, which is not unusual. Indeed, it is not unusual to find such a clause in a Bill, and I therefore commend it to my hon. Friends and Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a day of sweetness and light. The Minister has kept her record for 9 December 1999; 9/12/99 is a euphonious date and I was pleased by what she said. She has plainly given the Committee assurances that the clause—which is seemingly extremely broad—will be construed narrowly and sensibly by the courts. She did not say so, but I think that the fiver belonging to the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford is probably safe. He could have had the courage of his convictions and put it on the desk. Had he done so, he would be entitled to grin broadly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel a little better about the operation of the clause than I did 10 minutes ago. However, what is the meaning of the Bill's general purposes? The term is not defined. We are concerned that, under the clause the Treasury has power to make supplemental provisions—supplemental means additional—
	<br><q><p>"for the general purposes, or any particular purpose, of this Act".</p></q>
The general purpose in relation to common sense is the regulation of the financial services industry, which is as wide as one wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased by the spirit of what the Minister said and, as my right hon. and learned Friend commented, we are pleased to accept it late. However, I am still uncomfortable with the width of the power, and a few words on general purposes may make me more relaxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my words pleased the hon. Gentleman. However, he was not listening. I explained general purposes which—in one sense—means general purposes. Soon I will be asked to define what table means. I have a background in philosophy and I suppose that I could spend some time on the subject, but as I have said, the Bill covers a wide range and it would be best for the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) to relax outside the Committee, as there is a danger that it is addling his brain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has an extraordinarily lucid mind. He has made a great contribution to improving the quality of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That great contribution is shown not only by his comments this afternoon and the six clauses that he had a hand in drafting, but by the 63 occasions on which Ministers have listened to him and agreed to go away and think about his proposals. I welcome the Minister's interpretation of the phrase in subsection (1), which will be of some comfort to those who remain concerned that this could lead to the Treasury having the power to rewrite the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain concerned about one other aspect. The clause begins:—
	<br><q><p>"the Treasury may by order"—</p></q>
that is by negative resolution of the House—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1261</span>
	<br><q><p>"make such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental provision as they consider necessary or expedient".</p></q>
Would the Minister make it 64 issues that she is prepared to look at again? Could she see whether most or all of the possible changes could not be more narrowly defined as was the case in the 1986 Act? The areas under which the Treasury could use those varying powers were clearly circumscribed. Could they be subject to an affirmative resolution of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am unable to help the hon. Gentleman any further on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I must tell the Committee that the Opposition will table amendments on Report to achieve that effect. We will oppose clause 361 standing part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 942, in page 186, leave out lines 4 to 18.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would leave out "order" and insert "statutory instrument". The term statutory instrument includes both regulations and orders and it is appropriate that all statutory instruments should fall within the clause. As this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1262</span>
effectively adds up to parliamentary control of the territory, we feel that it is better to use the wider term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 938 to 940 are intended to improve parliamentary control of statutory instruments. In practically all cases, there should be a positive rather than a negative resolution procedure and we have sought to make all such instruments—except for orders under section 19(5), which introduces exemptions, and under section 365(2), which allows the Treasury to bring different provisions into force on different days—subject to the positive approval regime. Amendment No. 940 is consequential and the deleted lines provide that only orders—
	<br><q><p>"made under section 19 to which subsection (4) applies"</p></q>
are to be subject to positive resolution. As I said, apart from the exceptions, we believe that all orders made under section 19 should be subject to a positive resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 941 and 942 are consequential. There is no need to provide that orders made under subsection (4) are excluded from the orders that are subject only to negative resolution, because they would automatically be subject to a positive resolution. Similarly, the two negative resolutions would become positive as a result of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would have the effect that all secondary legislation made under the Bill would be by statutory instrument subject to affirmative resolution. The reason for allowing all orders relating to the Bill to be made under negative resolution is simple. Hon. Members will know that affirmative resolution procedures are less common than negative ones. I hope that Opposition Members will agree that we have applied the affirmative resolution where necessary throughout the Bill. If we were to accept the amendments—and other Bills were to follow this precedent—Parliament would have little time to debate anything other than statutory instruments. That might help the Opposition Whip accommodate the hon. Member for Chichester's difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order-making powers in the Bill have been examined and improved in the light of the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee memorandum to the Joint Committee. As we stated in our response to the Joint Committee's report, we agree with the opinion expressed in that memorandum that the affirmative resolution procedure is appropriate when extending the scope of regulated activities and for the financial promotion prohibition in clauses 19 and 20. We therefore made appropriate provision in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which we have applied the affirmative and negative resolution procedures is also underpinned by the policy that Parliament should have a chance to debate any extension of the ambit of regulation. That is what lies behind clause 363(4) as well as section 2(3) of the Financial Services Act 1986. I hope that that explanation of how we intend to use statutory instruments will convince the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that the Government have provided for affirmative resolutions, where appropriate, within the Bill. That is a large claim and it applies to a major piece of legislation. We are clearly not going to get any more out of the Government in this respect and we may have over-egged the claim for affirmative resolution. It all goes back to the key issue of accountability, but we shall not press the amendment to the vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Sixteenth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seem to bear on the question of whether Members of the House of Commons can sit on financial services and markets tribunals or be members of the panel. I made a speech in a debate on that issue and strongly suggested that there was no reason why they should not sit on such tribunals, at least in general terms. There might be reasons for not appointing individuals, but there is no reason in principle not to appoint Members of the House of Commons. There are sound reasons in principle for being able to appoint them. Equally, there are sound reasons in practice for not discouraging such appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of my speech was that one of the strengths of our constitution is that people bring knowledge of different aspects of public life to the House. Some of us bring experience of sitting in judicial or quasi-judicial capacities. That informs our ability to assist the House in legislating. We take our experience of forming legislation to the outside world and, in particular, to the judicial and quasi-judicial world. We then put it into practice. It would greatly weaken our constitution if, by intention or neglect, we removed that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the schedule, as amended, it would remove the power of Members of the House of Commons to sit on tribunals, which would be a great pity. Consequently, I must ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the schedule unless I get some brighter news from the Minister. It is some weeks since I made my speech. The Minister kindly promised to ensure that the Lord Chancellor would carefully examine the matter. He is a busy man, and I do not know whether he has had an opportunity to consider it. However, I hope that he has and I will be disappointed if we do not get a favourable answer. The Lord Chancellor might not have had an opportunity fully to consider the matter because of his many other activities. If so, I would be grateful to hear that it was still being carefully considered and that we could return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my right hon. and learned Friend's comments. I strongly agree that it is extremely valuable that people bring up-to-date experience of other walks of life to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate to which my right hon. and learned Friend referred, the Economic Secretary kindly agreed to write a letter answering some of the points that he made. I do not know whether he received his letter. I asked a question about members of the tribunal and the position of Members of the House of Lords. I do not know whether I got an answer; if I did, I must have missed it. If the Minister can remember what it was, I would be grateful if she could put it on the record.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak briefly to a couple of new clauses, which relate to legislation which has passed—or is passing—through the House and may have implications for the Bill. I seek the Minister's guidance on how that legislation is to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 16 relates to public interest disclosure legislation and the role of whistleblowers. It highlights the potentially difficult and awkward position of compliance officers in companies subject to the FSA. That problem has not, as yet, been resolved. On the one hand, such people are required to observe the codes of the company employing them and their promotion is subject to their performance in it. On the other, they are legally required to observe FSA rules and regulations and to report to the FSA when their company is deviating from those rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, that is difficult for those people personally and one can see how conflicts of interest may arise. Compliance officers who are exceptionally diligent in referring a matter to the FSA for investigation may face difficulties in their own company and their promotion prospects may be imperilled—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May we listen to the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If compliance officers are not diligent, they may be regarded as defaulting on their statutory obligations. The new clause deals with the role of compliance officers, who are important in making the FSA operate effectively, and would protect their position. Proposed subsection (1) would require any dismissal of a compliance officer to be approved by a resolution of the company management. That cannot be done by middle management, but would require the full involvement of the company employing the compliance officer. That would be important in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1271</span>
ensuring that compliance is something owned by the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed subsection (2) would require that the FSA be notified of any proposed dismissal, so that it is aware that someone is being subject to pressure, possibly of an unreasonable nature. Proposed subsection (3) would embody the idea of a compliance officer in legislation, explicitly recognising the role of such people so that their status is appreciated and any difficulties that they may have are met in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may envisage how whistleblower legislation may apply. However, as far as I can see—and, indeed, the City is concerned about the matter—such legislation does not adequately protect people who are seen to be unduly diligent in enforcing regulation. Such people should have the right to refer to their company's files to retrieve data. We have suggested the new clause to strengthen the legal position. The Minister may have other mechanisms to ensure that the compliance officer's role is properly protected. We have tabled the clause to the end of the Bill because it refers to legislation that has just passed and it is therefore appropriate for it to be considered here. I should be grateful for the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the all-party, convivial spirit got the better of me for a moment and I said something that I should not have said. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his proposal, but on 6 December the FSA issued consultation paper 35, "Senior management arrangements systems and controls" which I am sure is the current bedside reading of every hon. Member. It is particularly relevant on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly important to identify which person within a firm takes responsibility for the following: ensuring that the firm takes appropriate steps to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements; identifying breaches that have occurred or the potential for such breaches and taking any necessary corrective measures, including ensuring that consumers are properly compensated where appropriate. In its consultation paper the FSA proposes the following rule:
	<br><q><p>"A firm must take reasonable care to establish and maintain adequate systems and controls with its regulatory obligations and for countering the risk that it might be used to further financial crime."</p></q>
That rule is to be supplemented by guidance:
	<br><q><p>"Depending on the scale, nature and complexity of the business it may be appropriate for the firm to have a separate compliance function. The organisation and responsibilities of compliance functions should be staffed by an appropriate number of experienced and qualified staff who are sufficiently independent to perform their functions objectively, should be adequately resourced and should have unrestricted access to personnel and records of the firm as well as to an audit committee and to non-executive directors, if applicable."</p></q>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take some comfort from the importance that is clearly attached to the matter in the draft rules that have been produced so far to underpin the high level statement of principles. I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I tabled the new clause more to ask a question. Are the Government aware that the Freedom of Information Bill does not currently take the FSA into account? Is it a deliberate or accidental omission? How will it be taken care of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the Freedom of Information Bill does not include the FSA within the list of bodies in schedule 1 to which it will apply However, it is intended that an order will be laid under clause 4 of the Freedom of Information Bill, which will ensure that the FSA is subject to the new open arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first apologise for the fact that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells is unable to be here this afternoon? I should like to thank you, Mr. O'Brien, for having performed the lion's share of chairing the Committee in such a civilised constructive way. I would also like to record my thanks to Mr. Atkinson, Mrs. Dunwoody and Mr. Malins. It is a pity that the Committee has not benefited more from the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) who has considerable knowledge of the industry, but has been unable to attend.

We have debated important and difficult, territory. London was the major financial capital of the world for 100 years: it ceased to be so in 1914, but has just recovered its status in the past 15 to 20 years. I can assure the Committee that the City is a delicate flower. It is sometimes arrogant about its skills and its position depends on a delicate balance of good regulation, correct taxation, hi-tech skills and so forth. Many of us do not realise how easily the City's status could be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank my own team for its tremendous support. As the Committee knows, three lawyers helped us enormously and I am appalled when I think about the commercial cost of their help. They have given their services free of charge. When the cycle comes round, I hope that the Government will remember that opposing a Bill such as this without legal assistance—that is how our system works—means having to rely on volunteers for professional excellence.

As we see it, approximately half the issues we raised will receive further attention from the Government on Report. It looks as though our Report stage is going to be long and further issues will be fought. There remain major points of principle between us and the battle is not yet over. Before I sit down, let me thank everyone—especially you, Mr. O'Brien—and wish us all a happy Christmas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs in thanking you, Mr. O'Brien, for your expert chairmanship and guidance. Four other Chairmen have, at different times, overseen our proceedings—Mrs. Dunwoody, Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Malins and Mr. Gale. It was said a while ago, perhaps a little unkindly, that we had seen some of them off. Perhaps Mrs. Dunwoody thought that we had seen some of them off, but I am sure that that cannot be right. We are grateful to all of them for ensuring that we progressed through the Bill before Christmas was upon us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to thank the Clerks, Parliamentary Counsel and 	<i>Hansard,</i> for recording our debates so faithfully. I want to thank my hon. Friends, Opposition Members and my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.

It has been, on the whole, a constructive and good-humoured debate. It seems a long time since we began our considerations in the previous Session. It is worth reflecting on the fact that this is a landmark Bill going through a new parliamentary procedure—the carry over—for the first time. We have achieved a great deal in the time, although we recognise that scope remains for further improvement and refinement—inevitable with a Bill of such scope and complexity. The Committee has accomplished much of that work and many worthwhile issues have been raised, debated and taken on. That is as it should be in a Standing Committee.

What has also been heartening is the political consensus, at least in relation to the Bill's primary aims of ensuring that we have a modern regulatory system, and, at the heart, a single regulator with clear powers and responsibilities. Much of the credit for that should go to Lord Burns and the Joint Committee, some of whose members are also members of the Committee. I include also Members of another place, a number of whom were members of the Burns committee.

I conclude with two brief points. First, because they are here with us, and they ensure that things do not get out of hand—although in a different way from you, Mr. O'Brien—I should like to thank the police and the attendants for their role in Committee Room 10 over a long period. Secondly, I agree with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about the importance and value of the financial services sector. We recognise that and wish to ensure that this flower continues to bloom. We recognise that achieving the right balances is a delicate matter, which is why the Bill is complex and lengthy. However, it is an endeavor in which all of us think it worth while to have been engaged. I trust that we will continue to do so on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my co-Chairman and all the people on this side of the Table, I thank the Minister and members of the Committee for their kind remarks. The Bill has had a long Committee stage. I thank each of you, and especially members of the Front Benches, for helping to get the business through the House. I thank the Whips for their co-operation in speeding through the Divisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give special thanks to the Clerks, who have been my guidance, helping to draw up amendments and ensuring that the business of the Committee ran in accordance with the rules of the House. Thank you very much, gentlemen. My thanks also to 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make one more point before we complete our business, Mr. O'Brien. Someone once told me that a much older person had said that one should not to expect to be paid for a job and be thanked for it. I will make an exception. I had forgotten to thank the officials, the very important people who are paid to work and who work hard and deserve our thanks, They have supported the Government's work on the Bill. I have thanked them privately but I should like to do so on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
