	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Hood. You cannot imagine what a pleasure it is to see you this morning. Perhaps it is as well that we are not discussing congestion charges today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the amendments tabled in my name and in those of other members of the Public Accounts Committee, I reiterate the point that I made during the previous sitting that these are all-party—one might almost say non-party—amendments. They are parliamentary amendments. They are also in the name of the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon), and therefore reflect the views of the Public Accounts Commission as well as the PAC. They also reflect the views of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combined experience of the people who have tabled the amendments is enormous. The right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne was my predecessor on the Public Accounts Committee for 14 years, the longest ever sitting serving Chairman, and he fought on these issues for much of that time. His experience, coupled with that of the other signatories and the Comptroller and Auditor General, is extensive in the fields of accountability to Parliament and of the measurement and control of Government performance. On those grounds, I would argue that these are well judged amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrusts of amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are rather different, so I shall deal with them separately. Amendment No. 24 is clear: its purpose is improve openness and accountability in the Government's financial reporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(1) establishes the form of the financial statements that Departments will be required to provide to Parliament for the use of their funds. As it stands, the clause specifies that amounts must detail
	<br><blockquote><p>"resources acquired, held or disposed of by the department during the year, and … the use by the department of resources during the year."</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? One interpretation is that the first phrase refers to a balance sheet and the second to an income and expenditure account. That may be the intended reading, but we cannot be sure. The terms "income and expenditure" and "balance sheet" have meanings that are clearly understood not only in the world of accountancy, but among Members of Parliament and the public, so why not use them? They have formed the basis of financial reporting for almost a century. They are stable and will not change dramatically. Their explicit use would bring the Bill more into line with commercial accounting practice, which, after all, is the aim of resource accounting. The Companies Acts require a set of commercial accounts to include a profit and loss account—or, in terms relevant to the Bill, an income and expenditure account—a statement and a balance sheet. The Bill should impose the same requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (a) and (b) are not sufficient for the preparation of resource accounts. The appropriation accounts that resource accounts will replace are currently subject to a statutory requirement that the Bill will repeal without reinstating. Appropriation accounts are, by definition, cash expenditure accounts.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
Accounting standards require a set of commercial accounts to contain a cash flow statement. The Bill should specify the same for resource accounts, so that the existing statutory requirement for an account of cash use is retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was noted during an earlier debate, cash will remain a key control, even under resource accounting and resource-based supply, and will still be subject to separate authorisation by vote of Parliament. However, the Bill will not require Departments to provide Parliament with continuing information on their use of cash. That is a glaring omission. Parliament's first responsibility is to raise taxes, which are raised in cash, not resources. Taxes are accounted for as cash; indeed, they will be so accounted even under resource accounting. If the financing side of the equation is accounted for in cash, Parliament is entitled to clear information on the use of cash on the expenditure side. To give another example, the public sector borrowing requirement is also accounted for in cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that one intention behind resource accounting is to encourage Departments to think in wider terms than cash when deploying their resources. However, to Parliament and the Government, cash is still an important control. It will continue to be subject to a vote of the House that is separate from the vote that covers resources. A clear statement should be given to Parliament explaining how that cash has been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No successful or well managed company would operate on the basis of control of profits or income without keeping an eye on cash, and we should not do so either. The amendment deals with, that. Instead of the Bill's uncertain and incomplete specification of resource accounts, the amendment would require each set of accounts to contain a statement of income expenditure, a balance sheet and a cash flow statement. Those three statements have formed the basis of financial reporting for half a century, and two of them have formed that basis for a century. They provide a logical and robust framework, and it is difficult to envisage a need to change it for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will also repeal a requirement in the original legislation for each appropriation account to be accompanied by a statement that explains the use of cash that exceeds that which is authorised by Parliament. That is an important provision. There is little point in Parliament specifying cash and resource limits if it receives no clear feedback about breaches of those limits. The Bill should reinstate a provision requiring an explanation of variations between amounts that are voted for Departments and amounts that are used by Departments. That is why the amendment would require an explanation of variations between cash and resources that are used and amounts that are voted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary may say that it is intended that resource accounts should show such variations. Without statutory provision, that would be done at the Executive's discretion. We have seen time and again that Parliament's rights in this regard should not
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
depend on the Executive's discretion. That is not because we distrust the present Government but because the Bill will establish the framework for the foreseeable future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly said that the letter that was sent out early last year contained fictional accounts for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. However, Parliament has not yet seen a full set of resource accounts in which the relevant information is provided clearly. It has not been assured that the new system will provide as much transparency and accountability as the previous system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment's proposed new subsection 1(a) would require the income and expenditure account and the balance sheet to show a true and fair view. It is a statutory requirement in the commercial world that directors of a company who draw up a financial statement should present a true and fair view. In central Government, the permanent secretary, in his role as accounting officer, occupies a similar role to that of a director of a company, and he or she be under similar obligations. It is he or she who puts his or her name to the accounts and who signs them off before passing them to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. It is anomalous that clause 6 requires the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the accounts
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a view to satisfying himself … that the accounts present a true and fair view",</p></blockquote>
but that there is no requirement on Departments to ensure that accounts present such a view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who are accountable for expenditure should be under a statutory obligation to follow the accepted rules, and the Comptroller and Auditor General should assure us that the rules have been followed. The Bill's failure to require Departments to produce financial statements that present a true and fair view is a major omission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Comptroller and Auditor General's interpretation of the phrase "a true and fair view" be the same as that which is used under generally accepted accounting principles, and which is, in effect, the private sector's interpretation of the phrase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is suffering from prescience—he raised the matter that I am about to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Economic Secretary will point out that clause 5 requires the Treasury to issue directions to Departments to ensure that resource accounts conform to generally accepted accounting principles, subject to such adaptations as are necessary in the context of departmental accounts. Placing Departments under a statutory requirement to present a true and fair view would not reflect the special nature of public sector accounting. However, while "a true and fair view" implies adherence to private sector accounting standards, the Accounting Standards Board has recognised that standards have to be departed from in exceptional circumstances. A statutory requirement on Departments to provide a true and fair view in presenting their financial statements would not conflict with the need for a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
generally accepted accounting practice to be subject to the adaptations that are necessary to reflect the central Government context. In any case, objections to the amendment on those grounds would be inconsistent with the requirement on the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide an opinion on whether the accounts represent a true and fair view. The Bill contains no provision for his true and fair opinion to carry a caveat with reference to the necessary amendments to generally accepted accounting principles in the public sector—although I would naturally expect him to exercise common sense in dealing with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will probably respond that in practice we must expect the Treasury to behave in a sensible way. I offer the Committee a way of testing that point of view. During the previous sitting we talked about the process of supply in the House, which I described as a disgrace. To test the idea that we should rely on the Treasury's view, we should consider what it has done historically. If one looks at the estimates produced by almost any Department, it will be evident that they are not very informative. In fact, they are completely opaque and consequently difficult for a layman—or an ordinary Member of Parliament—to understand. This is a matter of parliamentary accountability, and it is vital that we clearly specify what we expect from Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether my right hon. Friend's statements as Chairman of the PAC will have a particular effect in law under Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart. I suspect that they may, and would therefore be grateful if he could give a further clarification. If the Government accept the amendment, will it be the judgment of the Accounting Standards Board as to whether the accounts are true and fair that is material when the matter comes to be judged in court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it will necessarily be the judgment of the ASB. In the first instance, the Comptroller and Auditor General's judgment will be relevant in interpreting the issue. The point partly depends on the Minister's response to our discussions on Tuesday about an independent accounting standards body. We all accept that it is necessary to address the issue of what is special about central Government accounting. That is all that I propose to say about amendment No. 24, which is important in respect of transparency and the rights of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 addresses an incredibly significant issue. It is linked with an amendment that I have tabled to clause 6, which would provide for the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination of performance reports. The revolutionary element of resource accounting, as originally envisaged, was the link between resources used and performance delivered. Its aim was to provide the public and Parliament with information on what they get for their money rather than just how much money was spent—focusing on outcomes rather than inputs. Performance reporting by Departments is therefore one of the most important developments to come out of the Government's modernisation initiative. Speaking personally, I count myself as one of those who
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
believe in the high quality and effective delivery of public services, and view this as possibly the most revolutionary reform of Government for a long time. It holds the prospect of dramatic improvement in the delivery of public services to those whom the Government want to help, including the most vulnerable in society. It will focus on how many people are cured rather than how much money is put into the health service. It will focus on how well we teach children, rather than how much is spent on education. It will focus on how well our justice system works, rather than how much money we spend in legal aid and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill covers issues that were the original focus of Parliament in the control of supply. In this sitting, which is one of the first in the new millennium, the future purpose of Parliament will focus on the extent to which we can deliver good public services to British citizens. That is a vital component of resource accounting and is, in many ways, more vital than the commercial accounting practice that we are introducing in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that strikes me is that the Government have changed course. Performance reporting was integral to the accounts at the outset. At every stage of parliamentary consideration of the initiative, the importance attached to performance measures and their independent validation was paramount. I am referring not just to the Public Accounts Committee but to the Treasury Select Committee and the Procedure Committee. They argued in favour of the importance of these measures and independent validation by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office. That is why the amendment focuses on sending the information to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have good, clear accounts for the public sector, we must have a system of good, clear performance information to go with it. Modern management of public finance demands that Departments show what has been achieved with the money provided by Parliament. The Bill is silent on that. My judgment and that of the Public Accounts Committee is that this is a missed opportunity of mammoth proportions. The technology is now available to measure performance at a micro level, as well as a macro level, creating an unprecedented opportunity to identify and spread good practice, improve value for money and so on. The Government seem to have recognised that, and are developing an extensive performance measurement regime, but almost independent of that, they have moved the goal posts with respect to the link to resource accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Integral to resource accounting when it was first introduced was a requirement on Departments to produce a statement known as an output and performance analysis, in which they reported their performance by objectives. That was an integral requirement, not an option, and it was to be produced and published within the financial reporting cycle. That would have established a clear link between performance and resources. It would have enabled Parliament to make well-founded
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
judgments about the effectiveness and use of resources in pursuit of Government policy and would have been in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By not incorporating in the Bill the requirement to produce output and performance analyses, the Government have broken the direct link between performance and resources, which was a cornerstone of the resource accounting initiative. That would have ensured a direct comparison between resources expended and output achieved, and would have provided valuable information to Parliament as it considered future spending programmes. The amendment would ensure that Parliament had that detailed performance information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in the public sector, bodies are required by statute to provide performance information. The Government, rightly, are imposing a rigorous, independently audited performance measurement regime in local government. They are pouring millions of pounds into the Audit Commission to finance the new audit regime, but we have yet to hear a well founded argument why central Government should be different. That relates to the issue of independent validation and performance information. In local government, the best value performance regime will be rigorously audited; indeed, the Audit Commission is expanding massively to do that. However, the Government have refused to match that discipline in central government. The failure of the Bill to provide the Comptroller and Auditor General with the information to allow him to examine a report on departmental performance information will undermine its credibility and usefulness. That is a tragedy for the Government and for Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are undertaking a large amount of performance information creation. Research done by a Liberal Democrat Member on written questions in the past few weeks showed that 2,500 new performance measures were being created. We should consider the risk involved in that, which applies to any Government. Under this Government and the previous Government, there have been disputes about the nature of information. Most recently, those disputes have been in relation to national health service waiting list figures, tax burdens and numbers of policemen. Under the previous Government, disputes were in relation to unemployment figures, and other figures. All Governments are subject to the temptation to put the best gloss on their performance. That is perfectly understandable political behaviour, and a part of life in a democracy. However, it is vital to the proper operation of democracy that the public, and especially Parliament, can rely on a firm factual basis of information from Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a significant risk that, if this amendment or a similar one is not accepted, the thrust of the performance measurement aspect of resource accounting will be jeopardised by sterile disputes over whether a particular figure is right or a piece of propaganda. Such disputes will undermine the public
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
credibility of those numbers. If that happens, the managerial usefulness of the figures will be undermined, even within the Department. The Department will start to view them as numbers with which the Minister can defend himself at Question Time, rather than a proper measure of the Department's achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, in my judgment, is one of the most important that I will table in this Committee. It offers the hope of a major step forward for parliamentary accountability and a major step forward in the Government's modernisation programme, on the presumption that that programme is designed to provide the best service for the British public in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendments Nos. 64 and 65, which are grouped with amendment No. 24. Before I do so, I want to lend my support to the Public Accounts Committee amendments. Without reiterating the arguments that its Chairman has ably expressed, I should say that amendment No. 24 merely puts in the Bill what the Government say they intend. It would not give the Government any extra duties—the Government say that they will provide such information, and the wording of the amendment does not overprescribe, in primary legislation, how that information should be provided to Parliament. Many Government discussion papers on resource accounting and budgeting set the matter out in that way, so it seems an eminently reasonable and acceptable amendment. As it seems self-evidently in line with the Government's intention, we look forward to hearing the Minister's arguments why it cannot be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis) said, amendment No. 25 is key. It goes to the heart of the resource accounting and budgeting process and method, which is about raising the quality of public services, not just about how much we spend on them. The performance statements, which monitor improvements in public service quality, should therefore be audited, so that the people gathering and using the information can be sure that it is valid and have faith in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden said, Committees of the House have asked for the information to be audited. Paragraph 23 of the Second Treasury Committee report of 1996 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore recommend that further consideration be given to including the output and performance schedule in the Notes to the accounts and to the provision of an audit opinion on the data."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of an all-party Committee. Amendment No. 25—the Public Accounts Committee amendment—goes along with the thrust of Parliament's previous arguments, and is not an attempt to do anything new. The Treasury will have heard the arguments before, and should be open to accepting such an amendment. As the right hon. Member tor Haltemprice and Howden said, it was a surprise not to see such provision in the Bill already. The Government have made an awful lot of how they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
are trying to develop the performance measures. Public service agreements have been fundamental to the Government's plans on how they will manage public finances in coming years; I refer especially to the comprehensive spending review. The Government's public finance management is based on the type of information with which the amendment deals. One would have thought that they would like to include such a provision in legislation to tick off another of their performance measures in the next annual report published by Downing Street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 65 deals with a different issue from those dealt with by amendment Nos. 24 and 25, and harks back to the Committee's debate on Tuesday about setting accounting standards in the public sector. It does not contain the Liberal Democrats' preferred approach to accounting standard setting; I do not want to repeat the debate that we have already had. It seeks to give the Government a chance to include in the Bill what they claim to be their approach to setting accounting standards, and it tries to describe the process that they have gone through in discussion with the FRAB and in consultation generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain why the Government are not prepared to include their own process in the Bill? What is their objection? She may reply that the amendment has a technical problem. That would be fair enough, and we would be more than happy to discuss an amendment produced by the Government's parliamentary draftsmen and women. Is the Minister prepared to set out in statute the framework of her proposals for setting accounting standards rather than simply relying on 13 words in clause 5(2)? Will Parliament and the Government have to rely on those 13 words to set accounting standards? Do the Government not want the measures to be more detailed? They have a process; will the Minister explain why they do not want to set it down? It seems odd that the Government do not want to set down in more detail than 13 words their preferred way of setting accounting standards in the public sector as has been done in amendment No. 25 by the PAC. Amendment No. 65 refers specifically to the role of the FRAB and to the 	<i>Resource Accounting Manual,</i> which should be referred to in the Bill as they are vital components in the process with which the clause deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 64 builds on amendment No. 25, the PAC amendment. The first part of it is a direct repeat of that amendment, but it tries to add something else. As I understand it, amendment No. 25 would ensure that when the performance statements are published, the National Audit Office will audit them so that they are subject to external scrutiny and validation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that is important, but amendment No. 64, which harks back to Tuesday's debate on the process of setting accounting standards, would ensure an independent contribution to the setting of performance statements and output and performance analysis before they are compiled and audited. It should not be a case of the Government saying, "Right, we are going to choose these performance standards. We are going to compile them in this way and use that data which is going to be produced and
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
published in this particular format." Surely there should be independent input into the framework for output and performance, measures. The Government have accepted the need for an independent contribution in the setting of accounting standards for traditional accounting. That is why they established the FRAB. It is consistent to say that an outside, independent body should also examine performance standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will not accept amendment No. 64 because it would establish an independent body, like the national accounts commission, to direct what is contained in performance statements. Although we understand that view, we do not agree with it. Surely the Government accept the need for an independent input into how the measures are established. We would welcome a Government amendment on Report that is in the spirit of amendment No. 64.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury has tried to outline its thinking on how output and performance measures will be established. In December 1997, it published, "Output and Performance Analysis Guidance". Although I have not read it, I am sure that it is excellent and intellectually rigorous. In compiling that report, the Treasury did not ask what outside bodies thought. It was purely a Treasury document; it was not produced by the FRAB. But the work on this subject exists and it could be examined by the NAO, the national accounts commission or the FRAB. We are open to suggestions on which body is the most appropriate to give independent guidance on the setting of guidelines. We are not prescriptive about that, but we want to hear the Government accept the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden explained that the data is important. We must ensure that the creation of the framework, and its external validation, is right. This is about basic considerations, such as improving the health service, our schools and the performance of the police. That is why our decision is so important. To pick up on what the right hon. Gentleman said, the Government will, presumably, use the performance measures that they have developed in the public service agreements and the resource accounting information that they have produced in their resource budgeting in the next comprehensive spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate a time when we will move to the next generation of budgeting—from cash budgeting to resource budgeting. But other Governments are considering output budgeting, which starts by looking at output—what performance is wanted from the public services—and working back to cash. Performance output standards need to be built into the framework so that we can move to that next generation of budgeting in, say, 10, 15 or even 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we are discussing new measures. It is not a case of borrowing accountancy traditions from the private sector. Developing performance indicators that are right for the health service is not easy and is a new, difficult science. These are early days. If indicators could be developed on which we all agreed, the NAO, political parties, the Accounting Standards Board and other organisations would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
able to pay attention and to aim for them. Budgeting could be done on that basis, and results would flow back. The main point of such an approach would be better outputs, although it could mean that less, more or even the same amount is spent. One can be completely sanguine about that, as we cannot prejudge such matters. If such information is independently collected and audited, outputs could become the goal of Parliament and of Government. That is what our constituents want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be open-minded and that they will accept the PAC amendments. If they believe that amendments Nos. 64 and 65 are technically deficient, I hope that they will express agreement with the thrust and principle of them and propose perfect amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ruffley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury St. Edmunds)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak in support of the amendment, which was tabled by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden. I know that its reasoning will be commended by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the Treasury Select Committee's remarks on the important matter of independent validation of output performance accounts and output performance measures. The Treasury Select Committee, of which I am a member, heard a great deal of evidence on the matters with which the amendments deal. We agreed unanimously that the Government's approach was not consistent. Much of the evidence that we received last year drew attention to the fact that local government performance indicators were audited by the Audit Commission. Professor Richards, a member of the Audit Commission governing body, was a witness. He said that the Government's failure to allow any external audit of the output performance account measures was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a very good example of central government … requiring other bodies to be thoroughly audited and validated"</p></blockquote>
He went on to point out that the Government were
	<br><blockquote><p>"not willing to contemplate undertake the same discipline"</p></blockquote>
themselves. Sir Peter Kemp, the august Whitehall warrior and man of great distinction, believed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the National Audit Office and/or the Audit Commission would be the natural bodies"</p></blockquote>
to undertake external validation of output measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence also drew attention to an important exercise that the National Audit Office undertook in relation to the Benefits Agency. The NAO referred to the failure of the Benefits Agency's internal auditors in auditing performance information. It said that much of the auditing was "significantly inaccurate". I shall not labour the point, but the NAO's work on its validation of performance data in the Benefits Agency, which took place a couple of years ago and has been published, is instructive. I was concerned about the matter, as were most members of the Treasury Committee, which was—I hope like this Committee—of a cross-party nature. Our conclusion on public service agreements was set down on 29 June
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
1999. We concluded that there was no good reason why external validation of OPAs should not be fully audited and we therefore regretted the Treasury's decision to exclude them from departmental annual accounts and reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the Public Accounts Commission arguing for external validation of output measures but the Treasury Select Committee, after hearing a great deal of evidence from witnesses and going through a different thought process, came to the same conclusion. Those two important bodies have undertaken serious work on this matter. Their view is also held by former mandarins such as Sir Peter Kemp, who makes it clear that civil servants and Ministers are engaged in an exercise to put the best gloss on Departments. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden made that point. There is nothing wrong with it. All Ministers want to make the best case for their Department and their ministerial colleagues. It is in the nature of Whitehall that they will be tempted to present and interpret output information, especially in relation to OP As, in a way that would not find favour if it was independently audited. I do not understand how that argument can be gainsaid in a sensible way. The Economic Secretary should focus on this matter. If it is good enough for local government output information to be audited by the Audit Commission, why is it not good enough for central Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a brief point to make on amendment No. 65, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats. I am sure that the Economic Secretary will be able to answer my question, which is also pertinent to other clauses. If a Department wants to deviate from the auditing assumptions that the Treasury makes in the 	<i>Resource Accounting Manual,</i> that is subject to a discussion with the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Ultimately, of course, the Treasury can direct that an assumption in the manual does not have to be followed in relation to a particular set of departmental resource accounts. We know that the membership of the FRAB includes representatives of the Treasury, other Departments, the Audit Commission, the Accounting Standards Board, industry and academia—a wonderful collection of the great and the good. If the Treasury issues directions that deviate from the assumptions in the 	<i>Resource Accounting Manual,</i> what is the mechanism by which the FRAB is consulted? Is it telephoned and told that the Treasury intends to deviate from the manual? Does FRAB convene a meeting to discuss a deviation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes a fair stab at suggesting that the 	<i>Resource Accounting Manual</i> should be reviewed by the advisory board. What is the process by which Departments consult the advisory board when there is a conflict? Are the individuals who comprise the advisory board contacted to convene a special meeting? I realise that we shall discuss the matter elsewhere, but it would be helpful, in relation to amendment No. 65, to hear from the Minister the answer to the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit to a suspicion that in addressing these amendments we may, for once, be doing something important in Parliament. In the short
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
time that I have been here, I have not often had the sense that Parliament particularly mattered, but I think that today we may be on the verge of something that matters, in the sense that it is possible that the Committee will accept the amendments. If it does not, another place is likely to insist on them, or on something similar. I suspect that, at the end of the day, the amendments or something like them will enter the law. So it is important that we expose as far as possible the impact of the amendments, because that will influence how a court will interpret them. The thought of that will influence the way in which the Government's legal advisers advise on the amendments and hence how the Departments approach them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 has been tabled not by the Opposition but by the Public Accounts Committee. The Opposition, nevertheless, subscribe to it. It has a significance that goes beyond that given to it by the Chairman of the PAC, my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden. He mentioned that there was an analogue to the set of statements required by amendment No. 24 in section 12 of the 	<i>Resource Accounting Manual.</i> In common with much in the manual, the statements have benefited from careful drafting—careful enough to avoid being clear to the average layman. However, one thing is clear even if one follows all the references—there is no reference in section 12 to a true and fair view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden pointed out, the second part of amendment No. 24 specifically provides that the income and expenditure statement should give a true and fair view and—more important—that the balance sheet should do the same. The amendments tabled by some of us on a cross-party basis to install an independent body to check standards have been not only withdrawn but vetoed, as a result of the fairly extreme measures taken by the Government under the auspices of their Whip at the end of our previous proceedings. At present, therefore, the Bill has no provision for an independent body with teeth. The Minister will say that we have the Financial Reporting Advisory Board, and I shall return to that subject when we discuss amendment No. 65, tabled by our Liberal Democrat colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider amendment No. 24 in the context of the absence of a body that would have a specific remit to set the standards for public accounts. We must, therefore, ask how a court would interpret the phrase "a true and fair view" if amendment No. 24, or something like it, passed into law. How would we want a court to interpret it? The phrase has not been dreamt up by those who have tabled the amendment. They did not possess the poetic ingenuity to invent a fresh Miltonian phrase; instead, they used a time-honoured phrase. Were the matter to reach the courts, as well it might, the court would want to hear from expert witnesses about the meaning of the term "a true and fair view". Those witnesses would be influenced by the meaning that the term has retained for a very long time, and which is defined by the Accounting Standards Board and in its various products. There may be doubt about whether reference should be made
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
to our accounting standards or international accounting standards, but in essence there is a coherent body of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Courts would tend to take a particular view of factors that, in the private sector, must be counted as liabilities to qualify as "a true and fair view" under statements of standard accounting practice and other guidance provided by the Accounting Standards Board. An argument might then arise as to whether there was a material difference between national accounting and private sector accounting that would highlight different meanings of the term "a true and fair view". The Minister may wish to correct me, but as far as I know the term "a true and fair view" has not hitherto been used to describe the necessities of public accounting. Therefore, there may be disagreement as to whether that phrase should have a slightly different meaning when applied to national accounting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us want the presumption to be that, unless there is a strong reason to the contrary, the term "a true and fair view" has the same meaning in national accounting as it has in private accounting. I hope that those words might have some impact should the matter come to court. For example, when the Government, as they will, entertain a strict contractual liability—as occurs in the public-private partnership and the private finance initiative—it will have to be entered on the balance sheet. Whether the liability will be sufficiently contingent to be entered in the form of a note, or sufficiently explicit to be entered in the body of the accounts, is a matter of refinement that should be left aside for the moment. As the Economic Secretary confirmed on Tuesday, the amendment would change the strict contractual liabilities of the private finance initiative that, at present, need not be entered in the national accounts in any form. I am pretty convinced that the state's implicit obligations to state pensioners, which amount to some £300 billion, would have to enter the accounts. The Economic Secretary confirmed—she used the phrase "I think"—that the amendment's use of the phrase "a true and fair view" would imply that those obligations, which are currently excluded from the accounts, must be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have a proper and colossal impact on the character of the national accounts. Inevitably, there would be a further impact. Given that the court would want to hear from expert witnesses, who would look to the ASB as the primary interpreter of the term "a true and fair view", the court would, in the long term, bring the ASB's judgments to bear on national accounts. That would do much to achieve the position that we were trying to achieve, albeit less elegantly, in amendments that we moved on Tuesday, which were supported by the Liberal Democrats. It would create a separate accounting body with real teeth that was dependent of the Government and would have an effect on national accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's comments and I support amendment No. 24. However, I hope that he is not suggesting that

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
in clause 6(1)(a) will be interpreted as meaning that if the Government provide a set of accounts, including a balance sheet that does not set out proper liability, the National Audit Office cannot say that the Government have not accounted properly for their liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a serious issue of statutory construction. I am tempted to agree with him in the hope that a court might pay attention to the agreement. However, I am not wholly persuaded that clause 6, without amendment No. 24 to clause 5, would have the effect that he intends. The Comptroller and Auditor General, as was shown on Tuesday, made it clear when he briefed the Committee that his interpretation of his own task at present is merely to ascertain whether, according to the standards presented to him as the proper standards—and hence, under the Bill, by the Treasury—are being applied in a particular set of accounts. Having the words "true and fair view" in clause 6 might change his mind, but we must assume for the moment that the Comptroller and Auditor General will interpret clause 6 in the same way as he interpreted his functions when he briefed us before the Committee met. The words "free and fair view" in clause 6 will not have the purchase that we want them to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 to clause 5 is very different, if subtly so. It refers not to the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General, but to the Government's duty to present
	<br><blockquote><p>"a true and fair view".</p></blockquote>
The question then arises: who judges whether the Government have conformed with that requirement? The only answer is: the courts. The matter is ultimately justiciable and it is highly likely that it would be adjudicated, just as if a party in Parliament, the Public Accounts Committee or another parliamentary body believed that the Government had not lived up to amendment No. 24, they would seek judicial review. The courts would consider that to be legitimate because the matter was of the greatest public interest, and it would undoubtedly reach the House of Lords. The "true and fair view" would suddenly become a matter of deep interpretation, and I do not understand how it could be interpreted without reference to the ASB. Amendment No. 24 gives purchase to that term, which clause 6 does not. It also, thereby, gives great power over national accounts to the ASB. I do not understand how the experts in court could be expected to interpret such matters without reference to the ASB, which would become conscious of that fact and would start saying things about national accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point out to the Minister—this may be otiose because she may be fully aware of what I am about to say—that as a result of her resistance to our amendments on Tuesday and the likelihood that, in the Committee or another place, amendment No. 24, or a similar one, will be accepted, her position, or that of her phalanx of 600,000 civil servants, will be materially more constricted than it would be under
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
our amendment. Instead of a national accounts commission specifically considering national accounting, there will be the uncertainty of the courts' interpretation of the effect of the ASB's rules on the national accounts. I am not uncomfortable about that—I am sure that the combined effect of the majesty of the law and the ASB will be sufficient to constrain the national accounts. However, our amendment would probably have a less constricting effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to my hon. Friend, especially in respect of his view that a court may look at these exchanges with a view to interpretation. However, the other place may look carefully at the question of the independence of whatever advisory or accounting body is set up to assess the areas in which public accounting deviates from commercial accounting. In that case, the issue would be self-solving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "a true and fair view" will transcend whatever the ASB proposes. Somebody interpreting "a true and fair view" would have to take into account the fact that one addresses different audiences when dealing with commercial accounts and public accounts. The PFI example that my hon. Friend cited was apposite. From the point of view of a private sector commercial company, the question of what is on or off balance sheet is driven largely by the allocation of risk. That is appropriate to the interests of the shareholders. In assessing what is appropriate for the taxpayer in the context of a true and fair view, risk is less important than prospective liability for expenditure. That is an example of differing interpretations of "a true and fair view" in the commercial and public sectors. "A true and fair view" is a good phrase, because it transcends the situations in which the ASB may make a judgment specifically for the commercial sector that does not necessarily translate identically across to the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that as well as having a technical meaning, the words have their own meaning and will be subject to an interpretation which partly depends on that. I also accept that there is a difference of perspective in relation to the national accounts and private sector accounts. That difference of perspective cannot be overstated. As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) said on Tuesday, from time to time—mercifully not for many years—even a British Government may find themselves unable to persuade the financial markets that their credit rating is triple A. If Moody's or Standard and Poor's offered a rating of the British Government that was lower than triple A, the risk involved would become very material, and the balance sheet would no longer be an academic or political issue but a financial one. For some Governments, that has become a crippling, terminal and sometimes war-engendering problem. Although—thank heavens—it has not happened in the United Kingdom, in Africa the re-rating of some countries' debts has led to political turmoil, bloodshed and changes of regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are matters of the utmost importance, involving circumstances in which risk may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
material. Mercifully, in the UK we are generally concerned with the political and socio-economic effects of later and deferred expenditure, and Parliament's duty is to point those out and understand their implications. The duty of the public accounts is therefore to bring before Parliament a true appreciation of later expenditure that will be incurred as a result of policy decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. The virtue of "a true and fair view" in this respect is that on the nine out of 10 occasions when the treatment of commercial and public accounts should be the same—calculating a depreciation on a particular kind of asset, valuation base, the mechanism for accrual and a vast range of other areas where there is a proper commonality of approach—the ASB would probably be the appropriate body. The "true and fair view" also bites in areas where the public sector is different. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) about the rating of the Government's financial instrument is, of course, key. The Treasury is not the best arbiter precisely because it has an understandable interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my hon. Friend's example of the private finance initiative, I argued with the previous Paymaster General about the whole prospective treatment of the PFI for precisely that reason. It might be used as a mechanism for creative accounting and off balance sheet accounting, which might be beneficial for the Government and the taxpayer in the short term, but, in the long term, it might undermine the validity and credibility of Government accounts. I am glad to say that the Treasury has reached a better conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept my hon. Friend's point but, in relation to the "true and fair view", on the nine out of 10 occasions where the commercial analogue is appropriate, it is covered, as, indeed, it is on the other one out of 10 occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with that. My right hon. Friend pointed out that I was, if anything, being insufficiently attentive to the strength of the amendment. First, I should perhaps have said that it invokes the principles, at least, of the private sector in a wide range of areas. Secondly, it inevitably brings the ASB to bear. Thirdly, it brings the ASB to bear on the divergences between private and public sector—inevitably—through the mechanism of the expert witness. Finally, on my right hon. Friend's point, it brings to bear, beneficially, the principles of the interest of the public in looking at future expenditure, even where one of the previous three items might not apply. That makes amendment No. 24 especially strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crucial point is that "true and fair view" is a technical professional term. Unless it was defined in reference to specific accounting principles laid down by a national accounts commission, courts would have no choice but to start from the ASB definition. As my hon. Friend said, if it were relevant, witnesses would be called to interpret it appropriately in terms of Government accounting. However, the ASB
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
framework would have to be used to define what "true and fair view" would mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the great help of other Committee members, I have sufficiently expounded my point, and put important matters on the record for the future. I hope that the Government will be minded to accept the amendment. If the Economic Secretary tells the Committee otherwise, I feel certain that there will come a time, in the legislative history of the Bill, when the amendment, or one similar, will come to bear, and will be tougher than the amendments so far rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn briefly to the other PAC amendment and amendment No. 65, which was tabled by Liberal Democrat Members. I am mindful of the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) from the perspective of the Treasury Committee. In her remarks on Tuesday, the Economic Secretary argued—irrelevantly to the issue then being debated, but none the less importantly—that the FRAB is an important and independent body and a sufficient assurance. As the Economic Secretary is aware, I do not accept the principle that it is a sufficient assurance, but I agree that most of its members are independent, and, as a body, it is probably independent. It is a body of great importance, because we live in a parliamentary system—alas, but we do—as opposed to one of constitutional propriety and separated powers. In those circumstances, Governments that command a majority in the House of Commons have virtually untrammelled abilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only constitutional device that is effective in preventing abuse by the Executive is embarrassment. So long as there continues to be—mercifully, there does among all our political parties—a basic commitment to democracy, and therefore to elections, Governments will be worried by the prospect of public embarrassment. They will not be worried by parliamentary defeat, which rarely happens, nor even by parliamentary scrutiny, which has little impact. They will, however, be worried that the attentions of the press and the media may result in parliamentary defeat or scrutiny. If I may be permitted a snide comment, never have a Government been more subject to that kind of concern than this one, as they are brilliant at dealing with, and being concerned about, the media.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FRAB is an effective tool in that it can create serious embarrassment, now and in future Administrations, because all Governments are concerned about these matters. A report from FRAB that the national accounts were improperly conducted would have no statutory effect under current or proposed legislation, but it would have an almighty public effect. The Minister would be the first to be concerned. The Treasury would send her and her colleagues scuttling over to see the FRAB to persuade them that they were mistaken. I accept the Minister's argument that the FRAB is an important element in the constitutional settlement, even though it has no statutory authority.

	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
Amendment No. 65 follows exactly that line. The Minister herself could have tabled it, because it follows exactly the argument that she made on Tuesday. She said that Opposition Members were wrong to suppose that there was a need for anything else, because the Treasury would always consult the FRAB, and that would be our assurance. Therefore, an amendment that would require the Treasury to consult the FRAB and the FRAB to review and report to Parliament will, I take it, command the immediate acceptance of the Economic Secretary, and I look forward to that amendment being made to the Bill today.

I turn now to the question of output measures, or performance indicators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend moves on to that subject, I have a question about the consultation that amendment No. 65 would put on a statutory footing. What would happen if, after the consultation, the Treasury ignored the advice of the advisory board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those Members who tabled the amendment may also wish to comment on this, but, as I understand it, no statutory consequences would result. There would, however, be great embarrassment. The Minister is, therefore, bound by her own logic to accept the amendment, because she says that there is no need for statutory provision, and the amendment would not be statutory in its effect, although it makes statutory the possibility of embarrassment. The Minister invited us to accept that that was a sufficient assurance. Amendment No. 65 accepts that, so the Minister should accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I confirm that the intention behind amendment No. 65 is to insert into the Bill a practice that the Government intend to follow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely helpful, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. We could, then, describe amendment No. 65 as the Minister's amendment. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Perhaps that was mischievous. I hope, however, that it will not appear so by the end of her remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not mischievous; it was merely an example of my hon. Friend's inexorable logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a comment by a stoic about that, to which I shall not refer, Mr. Hood, because that might intrude on your good will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the serious matter of output measures. I admit to slight unease that the amendments would not do the job that needs to be done, although some amendments that we shall presently reach may help. The comments of previous Committee members were undoubtedly just. The previous Government, the present Government and future Governments were not, are not and will not be immune from the tendency to present matters in the rosiest light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment's proposal that Departments should have the duty to report on whether there has been an exact match between targets and results does not do the whole trick because nothing is compelled to be the case with regard to the statement of objectives.
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
It would be consistent with the amendment's proposal if Departments did not advance any performance objectives or targets. That may sound fanciful but, in the slightly strange, Alice-in-Wonderland world of mandarin discussions, which are beautifully insulated from the normalities of life, it may be suggested that in some sensitive areas of public administration, it would be a mistake—I believe that the phrase used in Whitehall is about the best being the enemy of the good—to advance precise objectives and targets, because that would involve precise measurements. The amendment on its own might have a perverse consequence—Whitehall might retreat behind measures so vague that civil servants could report entirely accurately in relation to them without informing anyone of anything. That is the genius of systems of bureaucracy—bureaucrats understand exactly how to perform such convolutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the Opposition support the amendment on the grounds that in Committee or during a later stage of the Bill's passage we may be able to ensure that that potential loophole is closed and that appropriate standards are established. I suspect, Mr. Hood, that you would rule that a discussion about the ultimate guarantor in that regard would not be appropriate in this Committee. However, we need to establish an independent body to set the standards in the first place. It could ask the Government what their objectives were and verify whether they were established in ways that were sufficiently objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points arise in relation to my hon. Friend's argument. First, the amendment is deliberately minimalist because it has been argued—not very powerfully—that public service agreements are in their infancy and are difficult to specify. My view is that we are not dealing with rocket science. There is much experience in the private sector of measuring qualitative components and quality issues, and we should use it. The amendment was designed to be minimalist so that it would attract a complete consensus and, in relation to the 1994 Green Paper, be incapable of being argued against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, my hon. Friend discussed who should set the targets. That matter involves serious controversy. Governments come to power with a manifesto, having set themselves targets, and the public elect them on that basis. Governments have the right to transpose manifesto targets into governmental targets without being told that they should not do so. Frankly, I did not want to involve the PAC or the Comptroller and Auditor General in a discussion about that serious political issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that the amendment was intended to be a staging post, and that it would be acceptable as a result. I am sure that the House's intention in this context is that we should move towards more precise definitions. In coming decades, that will probably be one of the great evolutions of the legislative process in this country and abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept my right hon. Friend's observation that, in a democracy, Governments have the right to put before the public the measures by which they want to be judged without being told by others what those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
measures should be. Ultimately, it is the electorate who tell Governments the measures by which they should be judged, so it would be improper for a quasi, apolitical body to decide on them. That is not how democracy works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there may be specific measures relating to matters such as waiting lists, Governments usually come to power with a broad agenda. To achieve meaningful performance outcomes, once such an agenda is established it must be translated into precise departmental targets. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, such matters are investigated by the Treasury Committee. In translating an agenda, someone must decide what constitutes a reasonable translation. That cannot be achieved through the Bill, but it is important to note that it must be achieved eventually. As I have said, I accept that the amendments are beneficial and constitute a minimalist staging post; I merely note that they are insufficiently beneficial, and I shall leave the matter at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Economic Secretary will accept the amendments that deal with output measures. They are in tune with the Government's thinking and are broadly acceptable to all parties. Indeed, she may wish that she had tabled amendment No. 65 herself. One wonders how she will respond to amendment No. 24 and the question of the phrase "a true and fair view". If she accepts it, it will be music to our ears. If she wants the opportunity to table an amendment that has a similar intent, we would be content with that, but should she try to resist that intent, the Opposition will fight to the last ditch alongside those who share our view. If necessary, we shall continue that battle throughout this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be proper to give way on an issue on which the interests of the House and the electorate are one. It is not a matter of party politics; the problems that confront the Labour Administration will confront the next Conservative Government. The issue is critical to the proper functioning of the Bill, and of democracy. The Economic Secretary should realise that, whereas the national accounts commission was, in our view, a council of perfection, the current provision is barely acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems extraordinary that we are even debating amendment No. 24; likewise, it is extraordinary that, in 2000, we are still cash accounting. If one is to require of Departments—or any other body—resource accounting, it is axiomatic that one should provide a professional definition. When I showed clause 5 to some senior friends in the profession, they laughed out loud. They said, "You've got a tautological bit here: (a) and (b) merely state that resource accounting shall be resource accounting." I trust that the Government will accept the amendment, because if they do not, they will look rather silly. If they intend to have a requirement, they must give a professional definition of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 25 and 64 go to the heart of an issue of our age, on which future historians will look back and comment appropriately—namely, the increasing trend for Governments of both parties to seek to massage performance figures for political
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
propaganda reasons. The electorate are utterly fed up with it. The country needs systems that incorporate standardised bases of defining performance and, as far as possible, independent criteria for the basis on which performance figures should be collated. History will record how that was eventually achieved; I hope that the Bill will prove to be a watershed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 is relatively mild. It would give some leverage to the Comptroller and Auditor General, in that if he is pledged to audit performance figures, he has to audit them against something. An element of back-doorism is involved in making him the layer down of proper independent standards, but it has to happen, one way or another. It is a joke for Governments to think that they can go on playing around with figures, or that the electorate will be impressed with performance claims unless they are accompanied by some verification of independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 65 represents a reserve requirement. I hope that it will prove to be unnecessary because the appropriate arrangements for proper independent standards of accounting—if not a national accounts commission—will have been put in place before the Bill completes its passage through this House or the other place. As our earlier debate made clear, we do not have that now and it is vital that that situation should be rectified. If the Government are unwise enough not to recognise that, the amendment would at least keep Parliament—and the country—informed about what is going on if the Treasury is still tweaking and changing things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by returning to amendment No. 24. Parliament's approval of figures becomes a mere formality unless there are proper definitions and an understanding of the basis on which those figures are produced. The Government in power will always have the necessary majority, and ultimately the procedure will be a waste of time unless figures are produced on a verifiable and professionally defined basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to clarify the reasons that were given by Treasury Ministers when they appeared before the Treasury Committee on 11 May 1999 as to why external validation of output measures and the auditing of performance against targets is a bad idea. That will save the Committee time, and may help the Minister to formulate her reply. The Select Committee, of which I am a member, was not impressed by the reasoning of the then Chief Secretary, now the Secretary of State for Health. The first reason that he gave was that targets were still being refined. There was no point in having external validation or audit because the Government started to tweak the output and performance analyses and the public service agreements in their infancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Chief Secretary's second reason was that standards for auditing performance measures had not yet been agreed. We can understand that they have not yet been agreed, but that is no reason for not embracing the principle of external audit and validation performance output.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason was interesting. The then Chief Secretary said that the National Audit Office should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
not be an external auditor of performance measures because it would be getting into target setting. There was concern that the NAO would be setting targets. That was mischievous of the then Chief Secretary. The NAO's report on the Benefits Agency in July 1998 stated clearly, and we accept, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the validator"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the external validator of performance information—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would not comment on the objectives or targets themselves, which are a matter for Ministers."</p></blockquote>
The comments from the Opposition Benches have been to that effect. Public service agreements and output and performance analyses are one measure of whether objectives have been met, but the objectives are a matter for Ministers, and rightly so. It was mischievous of the Government to suggest that the external validator would be setting targets because that is manifestly not so. It is not the wish of the NAO or any other body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth reason given by the then Chief Secretary for not embracing external validation was devastating—he said that it would cost money. We can agree with him that auditing costs money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth reason, which was not convincing, was that the NAO would be taken into the arena of local government, raising questions about its relationship with the Audit Commission. The argument was that the NAO might upset the Audit Commission if it entered the realms of auditing Government performance measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments were not convincing and I shall close by reading from the short conclusion from the all-party Treasury Committee, whose judgment was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We agree that reporting standards for performance information are necessary and that work on them should continue; but the fact that this work is not yet complete does not, in our view, give grounds for delay in the implementation of external auditing".</p></blockquote>
I thought it important to put on the record the conclusions of the Select Committee, which were cross-party in spirit. The then Chief Secretary's reasons were not persuasive or convincing, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will come up with some better reasons for opposing external auditing. What we would really like her to do is to concede the principle of external auditing and to accept the amendments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee was correct to say that, the first three hon. Members whose names are set against the amendments proposed by that Committee have a lot of experience in such matters. Sadly, that is not true of the fourth, but it is a privilege to be able to support the right hon. Gentleman in his amendments on behalf of the PAC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that, in my brief experience of the Public Accounts Committee, performance review is already taking place in that Committee. It may not have been set up specifically to do that, but in practice many of the questions asked in that Committee refer
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
to performance and not just to accounts and how well Government expenditure has been accounted for and reviewed. The amendments would put in place proposals that one would expect the Government to support and which, to some extent, are already in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in amendment No. 24 appear to match the approach that Government have said that they support, and I do not expect them to object to it. Amendment No. 25 either matches the Government's intentions, in which case the Bill should state their intentions clearly, or it does not, in which case Committee members have rightly asked why the Government feel that that approach is right for local government—the district auditor already performs such functions—but not for central Government. If the amendment does not match the Government's intentions, the Government appear to be saying, "Don't do as I do, but as I say". Why do the Government think that procedures that are appropriate for local government are not appropriate for central Government? My experience of local government suggests that such matters are handled better in local government than in central Government. Performance accounting and resource accounting are better handled in local government than in central Government. That may be why the Government believe that the Bill is necessary. I hope that amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are in line with the Government's intentions and that they accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a point that I made during our debate on the sittings motion: some people believe that such a change may be inconvenient for the Government. The hon. Member for West Dorset, who is no longer here, said that the proposal would be inconvenient for a future Conservative Government, but he appeared to forget to add that it might also be inconvenient for a future Liberal Democrat Government. However, his suggestion may not be correct. Allowing the National Audit Office to review performance might be inconvenient in the short term for a Government of any political colour, but, as I pointed out during our debate on the sittings motion, it must be in a Government's best interest to have their performance reviewed properly by an external and objective source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are signs that the NAO, through the Comptroller and Auditor General, has already successfully pushed the Government into making various savings in expenditure, and that must be in the Government's best interest. All Governments want more money to spend on the desirable objectives that they set, and it would be against their interests to waste money. An external source would help them to save money, and that must be in their best interest. It might be inconvenient in the short term to suffer the embarrassment of having an external and objective source criticising some of the Government's actions and some of the ways in which the civil service has carried out policies, but in the longer term that must be in the Government's best interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 65, which appears in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), is, as my hon. Friend said, clearly in line with the Government's intentions. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
therefore hope that our debate on that amendment has been something of a waste of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been in this Room for almost two hours, and I hope that much of what we have said has been a waste of time because the Economic Secretary is about to say that she agrees with us. I sometimes wonder whether the way in which Standing Committee debates are structured is somewhat peculiar. It might be helpful to have a ministerial statement early on in our debates. That would establish whether there were objections to amendments, and we could focus our arguments on those objections. This morning, we may have been making points that the Economic Secretary already accepts, and it would have been helpful to have been told that earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have objections to the amendments, which appear unobjectionable to many people, I hope that we shall be able to respond when the Economic Secretary has finished speaking. The Economic Secretary should accept the amendment and those grouped with it. They are in the best interests of Parliament, the people of this country and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister to speak, I inform hon. Members that copies of the minutes of yesterday's evidence to the Public Accounts Committee are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond for the Government. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) remarked, if Opposition Members were to make shorter speeches, which would allow them to hear what the Government had to say sooner, it would be welcome. It would set a new trend in Standing Committee behaviour, to judge by the Committees of which I have been a member. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's indication that he might follow that path in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we discussed in the Committee's previous sitting, the Government believe that a robust and professional framework already exists to determine the accounting requirements for resource accounts. We also believe that we have introduced important improvements in terms of the amount of information on departmental performance that is available. I agree with those hon. Gentlemen who spoke about the importance of departmental performance information. The Government have innovated and made many changes so, clearly, that is an important matter. I shall deal with each amendment in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 would rob resource accounts of flexibility. Assuming that the Bill, once enacted, will last a long time, the amendment could become outdated as accounting standards change. The accounting statements mentioned might not be appropriate to all resource accounts in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to following best accounting practice. The financial statements prepared under resource accounting will, as far as possible—taking account of the particular circumstances of departmental accounts—follow the requirements of
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles change over time, and it would be undesirable if the requirement to comply with the clause were to prevent us from being able to follow them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with a couple of points made by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden. In relation to his comment on the incomplete statement on forms of account, details of the financial statements required under resource accounts are set out in the explanatory notes, in paragraph 24, which is somewhat confusing as we are discussing amendment No. 24. The requirement is for the equivalent of a profit and loss account, a balance sheet and a cash flow statement, which is exactly what the right hon. Gentleman asked for. In addition, two statements unique to resource accounts are required—a statement of outturn and a statement relating costs to objectives. That is set out on page 5 of the explanatory notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden also said that the balance sheet, and other matters, were of long standing, which I accept. However, by building specific points into the clause, the amendment would not recognise that practice changes. For example, the ASB has recently consulted on a proposal to merge the profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses into one statement of financial performance. Were that proposal implemented, the amendment would prohibit the flexibility to adopt the new and revised standard because the format would be specified in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has moved on. I was going to tease her about a most amusing yes-ministerish performance on the temporary nature of something that has been going on since the 13th century. I shall treasure that memory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more serious point, I do not understand how a requirement to give a statement of income and expenditure conflicts with the requirement under the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals set out a number of headings, the detail and content of which may not accommodate an unforeseeable development. We are trying to include measures in the Bill that will last for a considerable time instead of reflecting the processes, standards and procedures that detail current practice. I realise that current practice is changing for a variety of good reasons. Processes have to be adapted to accommodate changes that are introduced by the ASB and other authorities. The proposal in the amendment is too rigid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Economic Secretary, but will she answer the question? She posed the change as something that would challenge the amendment. How does it not fit within the term "income and expenditure"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is whether a future development would fit in. As I said to the right hon. Gentleman, we have no argument about what should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
be covered at the moment. That is listed on page 5 of the explanatory notes. We agree about the present state of play, but that may not be the case in future. We could produce a Bill that made impossible to accommodate a desirable development in accounting standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not one to interrupt, but the amendment is not exclusive; it merely states what should be provided. If accounting developed to provide more sophisticated tools, the amendment would not stop them being added. It specifies today's proper standards of accounting, which have not changed greatly for a long time, but it is not so inflexible that it cannot accommodate change. It does not say that what it stipulates are the only considerations. It would be easy to add to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the ability of hon. Members to see the future so clearly; they are more ambitious than I am However, the statement of total recognised gains and losses would include items such as gains or losses on the valuation of fixed assets.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is highly debatable. Whether there is a specific example or not, we cannot foresee the future. The only reason why the Government have not been specific in the manner proposed in the amendment is that we do not believe that it is appropriate, as it would limit the development of best standards in resource accounting in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Treasury has an annual Bill, the Finance Bill, and that the Government intend to put such a Bill before the House every year? Will it not therefore be possible for the Treasury to adjust accounting standards every year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's proposition: it is not necessarily a fact that there will be a Finance Bill. Supposing, hypothetically, that one does come before the House, there are still a lot of reasons why matters are dealt with in separate Bills such as the one under consideration. One cannot change any old legislation with the introduction of a Finance Bill, and that applies to accounting changes, which may not be appropriate for a Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the Minister to give the Committee a proviso. Hon. Members familiar with the Companies Act 1989 know that it contains such requirements, which apply to all companies. If the hon. Lady takes advice, she may find that adjustments should be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point shortly, as I was planning to do. The Government are sympathetic to a number of the suggestions made in the amendment. Paragraph (d) of the amendment would require differences between the amounts authorised in the estimate and those actually used to be shown, and would ensure that explanations of the variances were given. That is a restatement of the current requirements, as set out in section 26 of the Exchequer and Audit Department Act 1866. The Government had intended to repeal that section without replacement because, although we have every intention of continuing to provide the information, we felt that it was unnecessary to introduce a statutory requirement applying to that one item in the accounts. However, we appreciate that hon. Members may have reservations about moving a statutory requirement to a non-statutory base, as the amendment proves. I therefore propose to table an amendment on Report to reinstate the provisions of section 26 of the 1866 Act, obviously in a modernised form.

Other important points were made about amendment No. 24. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred to the Departments' detailed accounting policies. The policies have to follow the framework set out in the Treasury's 	<i>Resource Accounting Manual.</i> Deviations must be taken to the Treasury and discussed with the National Audit Office. They have also been taken to the FRAB. Deviation can be countenanced only where all parties agree that it would improve the faithful representation of the accounts and allow for "a true and fair view".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 131 of the RAM makes it clear that, for resource accounts to give "a true and fair view", compliance with the manual will be necessary in all but exceptional circumstances. As in the private sector, "a true and fair" override can be applied, so the requirement is for "a true and fair view" in accordance with RAM. Therefore, "a true and fair view" is set out in the context of central Government rather than the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In articulating that expression, I have been emphasising somewhat the indefinite article. The requirement is for a true and fair view not the true and fair view, but some Opposition Members have slipped into using the definite article. That requirement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
applies as much to the commercial world as the public sector. For example, under the fourth EU company law directive, it is possible for accounts to show a true and fair view in one member state that would not be accepted as such by another member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return briefly to the point that I was making about the Companies Act, on which the hon. Member for West Dorset was attempting to provide "help"—I put that in quotes. The Companies Act specifies the format of the accounts but not the detailed standards. They are specified by the Accounting Standards Board because such matters are not immutable. That is why the amendment is not helpful, with the exception of paragraph (d).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also require financial statements under resource accounts to show "a true and fair view", and the Government accept that they should do so. We do not propose to make that a statutory requirement because it is implicit in clause 5(3), which will require that resource accounts comply with generally accepted accounting principles. However, I am happy to table an amendment on Report that would make that a statutory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 65, clause 5(3) will oblige the Treasury to follow generally accepted accounting practice, modified only to take account of the specific requirements of departmental accounts. Accounts directions will state simply that departments should follow the RAM. It is not necessary to specify in legislation the way in which those obligations will be put into practice, because there may be more than one way to achieve compliance with GAAP. Other bodies, particularly the FRAB, NAO and Government Departments, are consulted on proposals to update and/or amend the RAM, which is already published by the Stationery Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FRAB already conducts an on-going review of the RAM. As an independent body, it decides when it should report to Parliament, and I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for West Dorset comment on that this morning. So far, the FRAB has reported twice on its activities for periods significantly shorter than the three years envisaged by the amendment, which is another reason why we cannot accept the amendment in its entirety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The setting of accounting standards relies on more than clause 5(2). Clause 5(3) will oblige the Treasury to follow GAAP, with modifications. How that obligation will be met does not need to be specified in the Bill. As I said, the Accounting Standard Board's due process, for example, is not specified in the Companies Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with performance measures and amendments Nos. 25 and 64. Before doing so, I shall highlight the major step forward represented by public service agreements, which have been mentioned only in passing this morning. We are presenting Parliament with clear performance statements and will provide annual reports on progress through departmental reports, which under resource accounting and budgeting will show outturn against targets alongside the departmental accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
I strongly agree that providing robust, reliable performance data is important. Indeed, in the recent PAC debate, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury commented on the importance of ensuring that reliable information is provided. I have ministerial responsibility for national statistics, and, of course—like everyone else, I hope—I expect the new national statistics commission, which has not been mentioned this morning, to play a significant role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission will be independent of Ministers and producers of national statistics. It will produce an annual report, which will be submitted to Parliament, and its precise coverage of national statistics is currently being discussed with Departments. However, one of its aims is to allow Parliament and the public to assess the impact of Government policies and it has the specific objective of improving public confidence in official statistics by demonstrating that they are produced to the best professional standards and are free from political interference. The new arrangements are expected to be launched in April 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a result of the Minister's deliberations and consultations, is the new commission likely to have responsibility for setting statistics involved in output and performance measures? If so, that is a change from what was said about the commission on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The commission will have a role in examining all data that is produced. We are in discussion with Departments and shall report in the next couple of months, in time, we hope, for the new arrangements to be launched in April. We are starting to appoint members of the commission, whom we expect to be involved in deciding the detail of their role. There is no point in having an independent commission if it cannot develop a role independent of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks about the commission having a role, but when the matter was debated in the House, it was argued that that role would be decided by Departments, not by statute or the commission. Has the Minister moved from that position, or is the role to be Department-determined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Departments will produce statistics that they feel are appropriate to include in national statistics. Obviously, it will be up to the commission to determine whether those statistics meet the required standards for acceptance. However, we are not here to discuss the future of national statistics. I assure the hon. Gentleman that many measures will be hallmarked as national statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November's PAC debate, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said that reliable systems should be in place for measuring and monitoring performance. However, he went on to say that he was not sure that mandatory external validation by the NAO was necessarily the best way forward. Several issues will have to be considered further as performance reporting policy develops. It is too early to give exact details at this stage. Rejecting the amendment will not preclude any of the options that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
are emerging as the policy is currently being developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a series of reports on performance measurement over the past few years. He has done so by virtue of section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, which constrains him from querying the merits of a policy. That is a reasonable constraint, and I am sure that the Comptroller and Auditor General would not wish to be other than constrained in that way, because the merits of policy are a matter for political decision and it would be inappropriate, and perhaps controversial, for an independent figure such as he to be drawn into commenting on them. Legal advice suggests that such constraints would also prevent him from criticising the performance measures and targets that the Government had included in its service agreements. That should be borne in mind when considering the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite convinced by the Minister's argument. She says that, under the terms of the 1983 Act, the National Audit Office was required to distinguish between getting involved in policy and validating the accounts. In other words, since 1983 it has developed a culture of being able to make that distinction. It has done that exceedingly well, especially in its value for money reports. Does it not, therefore, already have the skills to distinguish between validating from a statistical point of view the performance statements that amendments Nos. 25 and 64 would require it to receive, and commenting on them in terms of policy? Is not the Minister arguing against herself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not. The hon. Gentleman is confused. I seldom argue against myself, for reasons that are clear to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should go through some of the outstanding issues on validation. No standards for validation have yet been established, and there are still many questions as to what form it should take. Hon. Members have rightly suggested that they require details of the exact role of the National Statistics Commission, in terms of the quality of the measures which will be covered by it. There are also questions relating to the meaning of validation for measures based on data from private sector companies and international bodies, and whether bodies that might conduct validation have the necessary skills and resources to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many issues to be examined. As the Government introduce these measures, we are committed to making sure that we get it right, and that we get performance measures worthy of the purpose for which they are intended. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden rightly said that the provisions might do more to transform the way in which the Government worked, the issue of accountability and the assessment of how well the Government were doing than even the development of resource accounting and budgeting, which will itself be a big step in the right direction in terms of accounting. We intend to keep this issue under active review. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
are serious questions about the appropriate form of validation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public service agreements have built on and extended the foundations laid by output and performance analyses by providing comprehensive targets for the Government's objectives prior to the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting. The Government plan to build on that even further in the next spending review by producing targets on the management of operations separately in new service delivery agreements. Public service agreements will continue as slimmer documents, focusing only on the Government's key performance targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will, as envisaged, produce annual statements of performance. However, public service agreements and service delivery agreements have now subsumed output and performance analyses, and there is no need for a separate OPA document. Those outturn statements will be included in departmental reports and, under RAB, alongside departmental accounts, as originally planned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The targets that the Government set are determined by Ministers and presented to Parliament by Ministers. Therefore, performance against the targets should properly be reported to the House by Ministers. The amendments would break that essential chain of accountability by requiring performance information to be included with the accounts that are prepared by the accounting officer and by requiring the proposed national accounts commission to lay down guidance on preparing that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have already announced that they will report to Parliament and the public annually on progress, and that further details will be provided in departmental reports. Following the introduction of resource accounting, those reports will also contain a copy of the resource accounts, so that Parliament and the public may judge how well their money has been spent. The arrangements that we have already announced will provide for greater openness and accountability to the public than would be achieved by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, as Chairman of the PAC, will speak to the PAC amendment, and I have no intention of wasting the Committee's time by duplicating what he says. As I am a great believer in getting my grovels in early, I should tell my hon. Friend the Whip—who will want, I am sure, to have the vote before 11.30 am so that we can make progress this afternoon—that I will of course be supporting the PAC amendment, despite the heavy costs that are involved. I know that for the next few months my hon. Friends, having basked in the benefit of Tommy's nod in the Tea Room, will ride out through the back door, while I sit late into the night, in an otherwise empty Chamber, listening to the heady deliberations of three of our colleagues. I say to the Whip, in special pleading, that I do not take this masochistic course happily or readily. I wish that neither I nor the Chairman of the PAC were in this position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
Thank you, Mr. Hood, for explaining that the minutes of yesterday's meeting of the PAC with the Chief Secretary are being made available to the Committee. At that meeting, it was made clear that one of the reasons why we are here is that seven months ago, the National Audit Office sent the draft amendments relating to quangos to the Treasury. As of yesterday, it had not received a reply, which is why we are having to go through this performance today. That is not a satisfactory way for the Treasury to treat the NAO or the PAC. I apologise to members of the Committee. I thank the Minister for the point that she has accepted, although she will not be surprised to know that I shall press the case for her to go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to alter the focus of the debate. While it necessarily involves discussion of abstruse points about accounting and accounts, we and the PAC fundamentally seek to ensure transparency in the Government's affairs and accounts. That will help hon. Members—those of us who are not accountants have difficulties working our way through, for example, Red Book estimates. Transparency is an objective in its own right, but it also involves the wider objective of ensuring accountability. Our amendments would help hon. Members and people outside the House to understand matters that are at present largely unintelligible. Amendment No. 24 would place the relevant requirements on a statutory basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to tell my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary that the Companies Act contains the points to which we referred, and that it would need to be amended. If changes were introduced, companies and the Government would have the same flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In pursuit of transparency, validation of information relating to performance is fundamental. During the 35 years that I have been in the House, how much time have I wasted trying to get at the facts? Those hon. Members who entered the House two years ago may feel frustrated when they try to get information. They have to go to the Library to second-think the answers that they are given to parliamentary questions or the information that is published in official documents. That has always been the case— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have just been told that we must vote on the amendment by 11.25 am, which does not give me much time. I shall not pursue my argument further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate my basic proposition, which is that the amendments do nothing to harm the process of public accounting and everything to clarify it. If the amendments are agreed to and they are found to contain minor drafting faults, we should be happy for
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
the relevant adjustments to be made on Report. However, if they are not agreed to in Committee, they will not be agreed to on Report because, as we all know, most hon. Members will not be present on Report to hear our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the time, I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary made a few minor concessions, for which I thank her, but I shall press the amendment to a vote. She made two major points, both of which amounted to saying, "The man in Whitehall knows best. Trust us and we shall do what is best". We are debating public accountability, the delivery of a revolution in public service and the need for Parliament to continue to hold the Executive to account. We should not allow the mechanism by which the Executive is held to account to be decided by the Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary's comments on the Bill's drafting were, frankly, implausible. The words, "income", "expenditure", "cash", "assets" and "liabilities" will not change in meaning during this century, and they will not provide appropriate constraints. Similarly, her comments on involving the Comptroller and Auditor General in policy were wrong. He already considers some measures of performance delivery—they are much easier to deal with than value-for-money matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On both counts, I am afraid, the Economic Secretary's response was inadequate. I shall press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
