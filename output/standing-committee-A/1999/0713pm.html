	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>this day</i>]: No. 33, in page 8, leave out lines 20 to 29.—[	<i>Dr. Brand</i>]</p>
	<p>2.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. I am sure that I am not the only member of the Committee who finds it somewhat embarrassing to have to walk out of the Chamber just as the Prime Minister begins to speak, as we did today. I would have liked to hear what he said in response to the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. It seems ironic that, on a day when the House is discussing the relationship between Parliament and the Executive, some of us are forced to leave the Chamber to do our duty in scrutinising the Executive. Will you use the route of the Chairmen's Panel to feed back the discontent that I feel about that, which I am sure that other hon. Members share? The so-called modernised arrangements for Thursdays can result in our missing important business on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me, but I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and will relay it to the Chairmen's Panel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea what we were discussing before we broke for lunch. I was probably being unkind to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand), for which I apologise to him. He is a man of enormous common sense, and I was surprised that it seemed to have deserted him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has slightly misunderstood the origins and the nature of the obligation to inform, which has not been conjured up out of thin air but originates in earlier provisions in the Children Act 1989. It serves a sensible and practical function in keeping local authorities informed after a child has moved. For example, if a young person leaving care moves from Newcastle in the north-east to Newport in the Isle of Wight—in the hon. Gentleman's constituency—the social services department in Newcastle will want to know from the Isle of Wight that he or she has been properly accommodated, in a suitable area and with a suitable landlord. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
obligation to inform the authority is a matter of common sense, which members of the Committee will, I am sure, consider it important to retain in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood the authority's duty in another respect. He was concerned that the young person might go on temporary excursions such as a shopping expedition or a visit to his or her granny and that that would require the responsible authority to notify the other authority, but that is not the area in which we expect the duty to be triggered. It will be triggered when the young person has moved and intends or proposes to live in another part of the country. The arrangements must have some degree of permanence attached to them before the duty can be triggered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reconsider his views. Eavesdropping or snooping is no part of the intention behind the measure, and that is not how local authorities would discharge the duty. If it would be convenient to him and other members of the Committee, I can show them the relevant sections of the Children Act 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My objection to the new section, which I suggested was unnecessary, was that it was not an enabling provision, allowing one local authority to involve another in the exercise of its duties, but a mandatory instruction to do so. In more mature relationships between a sponsoring local authority and a personal adviser, I can imagine that having a negative influence. The Minister assures me that information passed to another local authority does not necessarily trigger action, but he has a hard job setting guidelines for local authorities to ensure that they are not unduly zealous in what they believe might be the exercise of their responsibility, once they have been informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to press the amendment to a Division, but it is important to flag up the subject. The whole thrust of the Bill is to place impositions on a local authority, which is right. However, the Bill sometimes tends to forget that the duties also carry the responsibility to respect the individuals with whom the authorities work. At no time is that made explicit in the Bill, so we will have to rely on good practice. I accept that good practice should prevail most of the time, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the reporting procedure could lead to undesirable practice. I am prepared to wait and see. If it becomes necessary to vary the provision, the Minister will be able to do so later, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several issues relating to the clause have not been covered by the amendments, and I would like to raise them now. Before I do so, I want to ask the Minister for some information. This morning, the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) referred to the percentage of young people who go on to become offenders. We had a short exchange about that and about how many young people arrive in the care system because they are offenders. The figures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
showed that a disproportionately large number of care leavers enter the criminal justice system. So that we can distinguish them from the more general problem, will the Minister let us know the percentage of people entering the care system who do so as a result of being offenders referred to, for example, local authority secure units?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to turn his attention to proposed new section 24(2) to (4) of the Children Act 1989. I asked him about the definition of "accommodated", and he told me that there was a lengthy definition in the 1989 Act. The solution to the problem might lie in the detail of that definition. Proposed new section 24(2)(d)(ii) appears to state that if a former relevant child—a relevant person under 21, but over 18—is accommodated, which in the everyday use of the word would mean given a bed, in a national health service hospital for more than three months, they would on leaving be subject to receive assistance as provided in proposed new section 24(5). The definition of "accommodated" may be sufficiently precise to exclude someone going into an NHS hospital as an acute patient and staying for three months, but I would be grateful if the Minister explained how the clause works in that regard. I understand what the Bill intends with regard to people who have had dealings with mental health services and community health services, but I am concerned that it may inadvertently cover people who have simply been in hospitals as acute patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise another point with the Minister concerning people leaving health authority or NHS care. Under the provisions for people leaving local authority care, it is clearly defined that a local authority in which someone was in care remains the responsible authority throughout the relevant period, but proposed section 24(5)(a) and (b) would provide that the responsible local authority is the one that contains the NHS establishment—with the many forms of care that the NHS provides—from which someone is discharged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about that because my area of Surrey has historically had a high level of long-stay mental health institutions. With the advent of community care in the early 1990s, many of those in-patient institutions were closed and people were discharged into the community. Health authorities in the area, particularly west Surrey, consequently have a much higher than normal requirement to provide support for people with mental health problems in the community. I am concerned that the clause will place disproportionate financial burdens on authorities because of the coincidence that institutions in their areas discharge people who fall within the provision and to whom they have obligations. None of that matters if the Minister's arrangements for financing the provisions take proper account of that and ensure that authorities are reimbursed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chatham and Aylesford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To what sort of NHS institutions is the hon. Gentleman referring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can quote from the Bill; anyone who has been
	<br><blockquote><p>accommodated for a consecutive period of at least three months—
	<ol>
	<li>by any Health Authority, Special Health Authority, Primary Care Trust or local education authority, or</li>
	<li>in any residential care home, nursing home or mental nursing home or in any accommodation provided by a National Health Service trust</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
would be eligible. My first question to the Minister was an attempt to narrow that down. I imagine that the provisions are not intended to cover such cases as the chap who has been in hospital with an unfortunately complicated broken leg. The people whom we are particularly trying to pick up are probably those who have been in contact with the mental health services, but that does not affect the point that I am making, which is that authorities that happen to have one or perhaps more institutions will have the responsibility of dealing with the people covered by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that if the financing arrangements are right, that does not matter. The local authority will simply be performing a function for which it is properly reimbursed or financed by central Government. If the financing arrangements are based on something other than a per capita reimbursement, however, considerable problems might result. I would be grateful to the Minister if he were to explain how that will work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I run through this part of the Bill, the next point of note is proposed new section 24A(4). As the record will show, the Minister told me during an earlier debate that the Government had not changed proposed new section 24A(4). For the record, the Government changed it during its passage through the House of Lords. It may make similar provision in substance, although the words are different. It would help the Committee if the Minister were to explain precisely how that works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new section 24B(2)(b) provides that a relevant local authority may give assistance to a person to whom subsection (3) applies. A person to whom subsection (3) applies is one who
	<br><blockquote><p>qualifies for advice and assistance by virtue of section 24(2)(a).</p></blockquote>
Such a person would be receiving education or training. The provision allows the local authority to make a grant to enable him to meet expenses connected with his education or training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the provisions that allow or require local authorities to contribute assistance to care leavers who are being educated, does the Minister intend to ensure, through regulations or directions, that such people are in no more and no less advantageous a position than those who are not care leavers but who face all the other financial rigours that further education involves these days? Will he assure me that what he has in mind is making a grant that would reflect what might usually be expected in terms of a parental contribution? We should not put somebody who is covered by the provision in a better position than someone going into higher education who is required to take out a student loan. I wholly support the intention to try to put children in care and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
care leavers in a position as closely analogous as possible to that of children who are more fortunate and have been brought up and looked after by their natural families, but I would hesitate to put them in a position that was financially more advantageous, because of the dangers of creating unintended perverse incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new section 24C(2)—which we have discussed a little because of amendment No. 33—provides that the person carrying on a home
	<br><blockquote><p>shall inform the local authority within whose area the child proposes to live.</p></blockquote>
What is the purpose of that? It is my understanding that, as long as the person is a child, the originating local authority will continue to have responsibility for him and be required to look after him. I am not sure that I understand why, when a child ceases to be accommodated in one area, there is a requirement to inform the local authority in whose area the child proposes to live. That seems to suggest that two local authorities will have an overlapping responsibility for that child. What is the precise purpose of the requirement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks several perfectly proper technical questions about the clause. I apologise if he has not had a chance to examine the provisions alongside the original section 24 of the Children Act, as that might have put some of his anxieties to rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed anxiety about whether a child who is seriously ill in hospital for three months or more might be counted as a child who is being accommodated. The answer to that is no, unless, of course, the child has been placed there by a local authority or voluntary organisation. Perish the thought that, if any of our children were to spend a period of three months in hospital with a serious illness, they would become an accommodated child for the purposes of the Bill. I hope that that is clear. The provision is a simple restatement of existing law. It might help the hon. Gentleman to examine section 24 of the Children Act, as some of his anxieties might dissolve. I hope that his point about proposed new section 24(2)(d)(ii) is not a particular anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the amount of financial assistance that might be provided to a young person under proposed new section 24B(2). No regulation-making power connected with that provision is provided in the Bill. The amount of financial assistance that might be made available to a young person will, therefore, be up to the local authority involved. However, we can deal in guidance with his anxiety. Again, the provision already exists. The clause simply restates provisions found in section 24 of the Children Act. His anxiety was that, if the local authority were to provide such financial assistance, it might materially and significantly place looked after children in a better financial position than other children. He looks puzzled; perhaps I have misunderstood his anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has moved on; I shall take him back. I look puzzled because he entirely skipped over one of my points, suggesting that it was no longer relevant. With respect, I am not sure that that is true. Presumably, even children accommodated in the Children Act sense but placed for whatever reason in an NHS institution outside the area covered by the local authority that is responsible for them will, on discharge, become the responsibility of the local authority in whose area the establishment is located. Is that so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am struggling to answer the hon. Gentleman, as I am not sure to which provision he refers. My instinct is that that would not follow, as I am not sure that such circumstances would change the definition of the responsible authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed anxiety about financial assistance. In one sense, we all expect the looked after child to be no worse off than any other child, and that is how I expect the local authority to discharge its responsibility to provide financial assistance. However, it is difficult to quantify that in strict accounting terms, and there may be perfectly good reasons why a local authority would want to provide additional support in particular cases. In general, we are encouraging local authorities to act in the same way as responsible parents would—no more, but certainly no less. It would probably not be especially useful to dwell on exactly how that will work out in particular cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a fair point about how the clause has changed in its configuration, largely through amendments made in another place. He was especially worried about proposed new section 24A(4), which he thought had been substantially changed to make the original duty more permissive. On one level, he is correct, but on the more substantive issue, he is not. It is incorrect to say that previous section 24A(4) contained a duty to assist or that the Government removed such a duty from the Bill. There was a power to assist, with only a regulatory power for a duty to apply in the case of prescribed persons, and the original explanatory notes made it clear that the regulatory power was to be exercised in favour of former relevant children when funds permitted. That power became redundant when the other place replaced it with a duty to assist former relevant children in new section 23C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The net result is that new section 24A contains a provision identical to existing section 24(4) of the Children Act. In a convoluted way, the hon. Gentleman and I are both right and wrong; we are two-all. He is right to say that this part of the Bill has been changed and I was wrong to say that it had not, but I was right to say that the fundamentals remain as originally drafted, and he was wrong to say that they had changed. We have not converted a duty into a power—it was always intended to be permissive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise if I have not responded to all the hon. Gentleman's points, but they sounded like technical concerns. I shall be happy to write to him if there are outstanding issues. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Ah—perhaps that will not be necessary. I have received a note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
At the risk of ploughing a deeper furrow, let me clarify the position relating to a child leaving hospital. The powers to provide aftercare for a child who leaves a hospital after, for example, a three-month stay, will fall on the local authority for the area that the child is in. If the child moves area, the duty will fall on to the new local authority. That is what happens now. However, if a child is a relevant or former relevant child, the duty will fall on the local authority that last looked after him or her. Going into hospital at a later stage will not affect that or change the responsible authority, nor will it stop him or her being a relevant child for the purpose of the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is slightly wiser. I am not sure that I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am struggling. I do not have the detailed definition of accommodation, but the Minister distinguishes between a child who qualifies because he has been looked after by a local authority—in which case, he remains a relevant or former relevant child no matter what happens—and a child who qualifies because he is or has been accommodated for a period of at least three consecutive months by some part of the NHS. It is the latter category that concerns me. As the Minister said, the arrangements for such children are in marked distinction to the arrangements for children who are looked after by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cleared up the problem relating to children who are looked after by local authorities: the authority that looks after the child will continue to be responsible for him—wherever he goes, whatever he does, that local authority is responsible. However, there is a distinct arrangement for a child who has been accommodated within the NHS, perhaps by the mental health services: he will be the responsibility of the local authority for the area that he is in. However, a child may live in a London borough that prefers to look the other way—a problem that the Minister identified when he introduced the Bill. He said that some local authorities were inundated with people coming from outside their area and were therefore disinclined to respond to the problem. Does not the Bill provide an opportunity to address a part of the much wider problem that he has identified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an issue on which I shall have to reflect further. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's point is a substantial one and I shall take further advice on whether the difficulties to which he referred exist. I assure him that we will consider ways of putting right any technical deficiencies on Report. I do not think that the problems he identifies are apparent in the Bill, but I shall reflect on his remarks. As a general principle, we are trying to resolve the arguments about who is responsible for children in such circumstances that have bedevilled this aspect of the law in the past. We are confident that we have resolved those difficulties, but if we have not done so, we shall reflect further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, about 500 children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister understands why I question him. Figures have been bandied about to show that a phenomenally high percentage of care leavers end up in the criminal justice system. On the face of it, the Minister's figure is alarming, but if a lot of the people who pass through the care system are there only because they enter it as offenders, the figures quoted by the hon. Member for Ceredigion are slightly less alarming than they might otherwise seem. The point that we must understand is the percentage of the number of people leaving care each year have entered it as offenders—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) have some information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that, whether or not people are offenders on entering the care system, by re-offending after they leave care, they contribute to the high percentage of former children in care who become offenders in the adult population and so the staggering statistics that have been read out build up. Such people may have been in the care system for a short time as young offenders, but if they offend again, they will bolster the figures and produce something of a false reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat the figures that I possess. I understand that about 1 per cent. of the population of looked-after children are remanded into the care of the local authority every year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that children who are taken into care after breaking the law or becoming involved in crime are not put into care for those reasons alone? A host of other circumstances are relevant. Local authorities prefer to work with such youngsters by retaining them in the home. We are considering the statistics in too crude a manner, as we risk not allowing for the other factors that affect whether such children are taken into care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always fascinated by statistical answers. The question was about how many children go into the care system as a result of offending. The percentage remanded into care by the courts was given as the answer. However, a larger number may go into care without being remanded there by the courts because that is seen to be the only solution for that

child. While it may be technically correct as a statistic, I am not confident that the Minister's answer gives a true reflection of offending among children in care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very different issue; I was trying to answer the question put to me. My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford made the point that there can often be several reasons why a young person comes into the care of a local authority, including delinquent or criminal behaviour. I am sorry if I did not answer the question correctly, but I was asked how many young people were remanded directly into care as a result of their offending behaviour, to which the answer is 1 per cent. There is always a problem with statistics—we all struggle to understand what any of them mean—but I have at least tried to answer the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will say by way of conclusion that it is clear to every member of the Committee and to you, Mrs. Michie, that the clause is complex. I do not pretend otherwise: it both restates and amends section 24 of the Children Act, and such legislative drafting is always complicated to pull off. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) has rightly drawn attention to on-going concerns about the way in which the provision has been drafted, and he has certainly given me sufficient cause to have another look at it. I am sure that we will find a solution to those problems, if any remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I understand the complexity of the statistical argument, but we have not got anywhere by the Minister telling us that at any one time about 1 per cent. of children in care are there as a direct result of offending behaviour. He is taking a snapshot of a stock, but we need to consider a flow. To put it in extreme terms, if people who entered the care system as a result of offending behaviour had an average stay of only a month, and people who entered the care system as a result of non-offending behaviour had an average stay of five years, the fact that only 1 per cent. at any one moment were there as offenders would not alter the fact that a large percentage of people categorised as former children in care for the purposes of the statistics that the hon. Member for Ceredigion quoted this morning would have gone into the care system as a direct result of offending behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister understands. I am looking for a measure comparable to the value-added indices that we find in education. It is no good saying that a large number of children leaving care become offenders without asking how many of them were offenders when they went in at the front end. In education we consider how good the system is at adding value; in relation to the problems in the care system, we should perhaps be asking ourselves to what extent that system is subtracting value. I hope that the Minister follows my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to have the information immediately available, but is he prepared to study the figures that the Department has available and to try to answer the question? We could then understand what proportion of the large number of former children in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
care did not enter the system as offenders, but went on to become adult offenders after leaving, and the number who entered the care system as offenders and re-offended as adults once they had left. The distinction is important for understanding the scale of the problem that we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the clause is small, it is important. It creates an opportunity for representations to be made to local authorities. We touched on the subject earlier, and the Minister kindly said that he was prepared to talk through scenarios in which communications between an adviser and a child break down. We are now talking about the next stage, when a breakdown in communications has occurred and the child wants to make a complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to give the matter serious thought, because we learned from the Waterhouse report and other investigations into abuse that children have great difficulty in making a complaint, getting their voices heard and being taken seriously by those in authority. That is no exaggeration. All those involved and all who have read the report have learned a great deal, and I have no doubt that those working with vulnerable children will now take complaints seriously. However, we need to be doubly and even trebly sure that it is made easy for such children to be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause places a requirement on local authorities to establish a complaints procedure. However, it does not address some aspects of the complaints procedure that are fleshed out in rather more detail in legislation relating to other subjects, so I have a few questions for the Minister. The answers will, no doubt, appear in the guidance, but it is important that we probe the Minister on what the Government have in mind. It is the only way to discover how the Bill is intended to work, and it will help to inform public debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I know the answer to my first question, but I seek confirmation. Usually, the ultimate backstop of a complaints procedure is an ombudsman. Given that we are talking about local authorities, will the ultimate backstop for this complaints procedure be the local government ombudsman? As Members of Parliament, we often take complaints to the local government ombudsman—it is a bread-and-butter part of our surgery work—but the ombudsman can rule only on maladministration. In my experience, many people suffer quite badly before a case goes the whole hog and becomes one of maladministration, and children wanting to make complaints might have difficulty understanding what is meant by maladministration. Many would want to complain about being treated unfairly: show me the child that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
does not regularly say, "It's not fair." My children certainly do not refrain from making such complaint whenever the opportunity arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the complaints procedure has real teeth. I mention the ombudsman in part because he would bring a degree of independence to the complaints procedure. What worries me is that the process set out in the Bill is an in-house procedure: the adviser will be appointed by the local authority; various local authority duties towards the care leaver are set out in the Bill; and the local authority is required to put in place a complaints procedure. The weakness of in-house complaints procedures is that they can have a damping-down effect on the individual trying to make the complaint. They are insufficiently independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to independent advocacy, a matter raised in connection with a previous clause. It is important that an independent advocate is at the disposal of the care leaver who wants to make a complaint under the procedure in the Bill. The Minister said earlier that the Department is consulting on independent advocacy. On Second Reading, the Minister for Public Health gave a sort of promise when she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>We will certainly use the powers in this Bill to ensure that care leavers have advocates to speak on their behalf.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 June 2000; Vol. 352, c. 419.]</p></blockquote>
That is a clear undertaking, but I should like it to be put in the Bill. It is important because the complaints procedure, as it stands, lacks independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Independent advocacy is not a new matter: it was raised in the other place by Lord Hunt, who said that it was in the Government's mind to do something about independent advocacy. We want that to happen in practice. It would greatly improve a skeletal clause dealing with representations—a clause whose thinness does not disguise the seriousness of a child wanting to make a complaint. No doubt many children have tried to make a complaint but were not listened to or could not get through to someone on the outside of the authority in whose area the cause of the complaint had arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abuse has gone on for far too long—we must learn from past mistakes. I want to know what in the Government's mind. I commend the use of independent advocates in the representation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister thinks about the regulations and how to set up a complaints procedure, will he make sure that he does not replicate the mistake whereby it was up to the local authority to decide whether the complaints officer was responsible to the chief executive, chief officer of the authority, or the director of the department that a complaint was about? In several cases, I found it extremely difficult to deal with complaints officers who felt constrained because their direct line manager was also responsible for the service about which the complaint was being made. I hope that my proposal will be taken on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Wales, the regulations will be made by the National Assembly for Wales, which raises the possibility that it may decide to make the new children's commissioner the backstop facility to overcome the problems of the local authority and the local government ombudsman mentioned by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). I hope that the Minister will respond positively to that suggestion. It will not affect the discretion of the Assembly, but I should like to know whether such action comes within the ambit of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. Member for Meriden about independent advocacy and the need for the complaints procedure to have built in to it access to advocacy at every level for the young person. That is of particular concern in my area—a rural county—where we have problems with advocacy, as it tends to be available only in the main towns. In my constituency, I can think of two towns in which such advocacy may be available: those towns are 35 miles apart and there is hardly a village of more than 500 people between them, although there are children in care living with foster families scattered around that rural area. The question of how they can obtain access to advocacy needs to be addressed by the local authority, within guidance that might be produced by the National Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister considered addressing the need for independent advocacy in this part of the Bill? I suspect that he will say that regulations and guidance will be sufficient, but the inclusion if such provision in the Bill, and, therefore, its possible discussion on Report, might be a useful way of setting the right tone. It would show that the Government regard independent advocacy as the way forward in the complaints system for young people in care, who, by their nature, are the weaker partners in the relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a short but very useful debate. It has been harder to have the definitive debate that Opposition Members might have wanted because the consultation document on reform of social services complaints procedures was launched only three weeks ago. We asked interested parties to give their views on what should be the important new features of a reformed social services complaints procedure. Many of the issues raised in this debate will be resolved as we respond to the consultation document. The procedure under the Bill will be part and parcel of the wider social services complaints procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden was concerned about appeals going to the local government ombudsman, to whom she felt it was not suitable to refer complaints about maladministration. It is difficult to see who else should be dealing with those complaints. It is probably best to leave referrals to the local government ombudsman as they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wider issue of advocacy arrangements are important. We have made no secret of that fact. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary was right to say that we have taken a robust view on the importance of having proper and effective advocacy schemes for young people in care. That will be a characteristic of the new arrangements. There is no argument about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
benefits or otherwise of advocacy arrangements for those young people—we subscribe positively to that argument, and, if necessary, we will use the regulation-making powers under clause 5 to build in a requirement for advocacy services for those young people. I assure the hon. Member for Meriden that we will not hesitate to use those powers to achieve the clear end that we have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion asked for my views on the children's commissioner performing such an advocacy role in Wales. I think that it is better for the National Assembly and politicians in Wales to express a view on that. It was charming of him to ask me to comment, but it is properly a devolved matter. It would not be appropriate for an English Minister to interfere in those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's sensitivity to such matters. Nevertheless, will he confirm that it is not necessarily the case that the local government ombudsman would have to be the backstop in Wales? That is because of the establishment of the children's commissioner, which we hope to see on the statute book shortly. Wales therefore has another option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are always options, but the question is who presses the buttons. In relation to primary legislation, it is clearly the responsibility of this Parliament. We obviously do that in close collaboration with the National Assembly for Wales. Labour Members certainly want the devolved settlement to work effectively and to deliver primary legislation in the spirit of partnership. On the children's commissioner, that has been a successful partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that, because the matter raised by the hon. Member for Ceredigion was a devolved one, he did not think that it would be appropriate for an English Minister to respond to it. Did he mean an English Minister, as opposed to a Minister in this Parliament who happens to be Welsh? Or was it a slip of the tongue for a Minister in the Westminster Administration? That is an important distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not in my gift to determine constitutional precedents in the way that the hon. Gentleman envisages. I was simply saying that as the Minister with responsibility for social services in England, I do not regard it as my responsibility, or appropriate, to express views about how the National Assembly for Wales should use its regulation-making powers in that regard. The hon. Gentleman was right; under new section 24D(2), the power to make regulations in connection with the complaints procedure would be a devolved matter for the National Assembly for Wales. Given that that is the way that things will work in future, that is perfectly sensible. I am sure that Welsh Members of this House would respect the fact that those matters are for the National Assembly for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden was right to say that the clause is modest, but it is important—given the predicament in which many young people in care find
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
themselves—that we take seriously the need to put in place proper and effective complaints procedures for those young people. We are determined to do that and we think that we can improve substantially on the complaints procedure. We are currently consulting on the best way to do that. I hope that she and the hon. Members for Ceredigion and for Isle of Wight, who speak for their parties on these issues—bearing in mind all that I have just said on the subject, it may be harder for the hon. Member for Ceredigion, given that he is a Welsh Member—will want to participate in the consultation process and express their views on how we can improve the complaints procedures on social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 9, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'unless he is an eligible person under this Act over the age of 16 who elects at any time not to be supported by his local authority.'</p></blockquote>
I shall not discuss the amendment from the perspective of civil liberties because I know that, to his credit, that makes the Minister uncomfortable, and when he is uncomfortable, he gets irritable—although that has not happened very often. I tabled the amendment because of a concern that I expressed on Second Reading. I am in no way trying to undermine the objectives of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter, which I believe was sent to all members of the Committee, from the Scottish Council for Single Homeless People which reflects the clear feeling among people working with young homeless people—specifically in Scotland, although I imagine that it is shared elsewhere—that one should not rock the boat too much because a tremendous step forward is being achieved. I share that sentiment. It is interesting that Shelter, Who Cares? Scotland and the Chartered Institute of Housing, among other organisations, are uneasy about the assumption that all benefits will routinely be withdrawn, except in circumstances to which I shall come later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an ideal world, local authorities would never have to act as parents, because parents would always have a relationship with a cared for child. However, because, sadly, that relationship sometimes breaks down, there has to be provision for a local authority to act as parent to a 16 or 17-year-old. It would need someone more optimistic than even a Liberal Democrat politician to assume that that relationship will always work out well, in the way that we all hope that the Bill will encourage. As has happened not infrequently in my clinical practice, I can envisage a complete breakdown between a young person and figures of authority. Young people are not short of a sense of their own importance and of being right. I am sure that many of us went through such a stage, as otherwise we would have been unlikely to have become Members of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
Parliament. That is a genuine problem. People will deny themselves support because they will feel as a matter of principle that they should not talk to the local authority, because it has somehow offended them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ensure that I have understood the amendment. Would it effectively make the application of clause 6 optional and allow the child involved to decide whether to be excluded from benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The nature of the drafting may mean that, but, to return to an earlier debate, in the event of a clear breakdown in relationships, a positive decision can be made. The hon. Gentleman's argument about adults over 18 applies to some children aged 16 and 17, too. The circumstances can, at the time, be irretrievable. I want to explore what mechanism the Minister expects to be put in place to ensure that some support, no matter how irregular, is available for young people in such circumstances. I realise that current benefits are hardly generous for that age group, but at least such people can receive housing benefit and access severe hardship payments, which may make the difference between a vulnerable young person receiving some support and his having to steal, deal or prostitute himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about what that mechanism will be. If someone turns up in London and refuses point blank to get in touch with a local authority that he feels has dumped on him all his life, or at least for the past six months, what mechanisms will be provided? At the moment, going to the Benefits Agency is perfectly respectable, because people are allowed to hate it, so they can still feel good when they have screwed some money out of it. That is the sort of attitude that is fed back to me from time to time. It is not a very positive relationship—indeed, it is rather sad—but at least it gives people some means of supporting themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the issues involved is how emergency payments will be handled. That may well involve an inter-agency agreement between the responsible home local authority and the local authority for the area in which the young person finds himself, or the Benefits Agency, if that is the point of contact. I should like the Minister to explain what practical steps he is likely to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like the Minister's advice about the treatment of lone parents and the disabled. It is clear from the guidance that non-means-tested benefits will remain available to a young person, which is absolutely right. However, will young disabled people who receive disability living allowance be denied access, because they are disabled, to the support, including finance, that would otherwise be available through their local authority? One section of the guidance states that all disabled young people will be on benefit. The guidance says that all disabled young people will be on benefit, whereas in another place it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
states that only those benefits that apply to the disablement are affected by the exclusion measure in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of young women who are pregnant and subsequently mothers and, presumably, boys of 16 or 17 who are noble enough to act as lone parents, although that is not a situation that I have often met. [HON. MEMBERS: "Never".] Well, quite. Those young parents, especially those who became parents at 13 or 14, are often relevant children and need the parenting support from the local authority more than other young people in that age group. They have the practical problems of looking after their child or children and need a stable contact to help them with the emotional problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the explanatory notes, it appears that lone parents are automatically treated as non-eligible children. Will they be non-eligible for financial support or for involvement with local social services? It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us the practical consequences of the pragmatic decision that someone who is a parent can no longer be a relevant child for a local authority. That is not an argument that I am prepared to accept, because in practice a lot of very young girls become parents who still have a need for a parent themselves and have no family to support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure might also provide a perverse incentive, in that people who want to cast off the shackles of their local authority can go and have a baby. That might not be relevant, and it is similar to the strange argument that people put about with regard to housing. There is little evidence that young women become pregnant to get a house. That is the sort of 	<i>Daily Mail</i> argument that I am not prepared to countenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions give powers of regulation that include anybody and everybody, within and without the regulation—it is very enabling, this Bill. The amendment gives the Minister the opportunity to set out, in practice, how the provisions will work when a young person is determined not to co-operate with the local authority but has a real emotional, financial and physical need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have some sympathy with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, but even he agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), who said that it was a bit slap-happy. It would allow young people to elect to leave care at the drop of a hat and go on to benefits, which is exactly what we do not want to happen. If a young person has a disagreement with his foster carers or social workers, he could say, "That's it. I'm signing a piece of paper and I'll be out of here to get my benefits." All young people and adolescents present difficulties; we do not want to provide them with an easy bolthole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On Second Reading, I said that I hoped that some exceptional circumstances would arise in which it would be better for a young person to receive benefits from the Benefits Agency than to get financial assistance from the local authority. The point about a young parent to which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred may be an exceptional circumstance, whereby a young person would be better served by the Benefits Agency than by the local authority. I should be grateful to hear the response of my hon. Friend the Minister to that suggestion and to know whether there is such a possibility under the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment could also lead to a situation opposite to one that involves fascist local authorities that hound people and check on them. A negligent authority could tell a young person, "If you don't like it here, sign this paper and you can collect your benefits and look after yourself." We need to be careful, although I have sympathy providing flexibility for exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have considerable sympathy with the purpose of the amendment and the common-sense argument advanced by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. Nevertheless, the amendment is quite dangerous. It would drive a coach and horses through the pivot of the Bill, which is the re-jigging of the benefits system, and the other sums of money that the Minister said would form a ring-fenced fund that is available for young people when leaving care. A completely open-ended system, as the amendment suggests, whereby any person can elect not to be supported would be hell for local authorities. It would be difficult for them to operate planning provisions and to have fiscal control, because they would not know from one year to the next how many children in care would opt in or out of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thing is too open-ended. The amendment would make it difficult for local authorities to plan a proper support system for young people. We debated
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
whether permissive powers to support vocational training should be a duty of local authorities. If local authorities do not know how many people leaving care intend to opt in or out of the system, it is unlikely that the permissive powers will be used properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford made a serious point about exceptional circumstances. We can all think of circumstances in which young people with families of their own—they could be approaching 16 and therefore still children in the eyes of the law—would need support arrangements different to those set out in the Bill. That again raises the guidance or regulations question: it is unclear how much will be included in guidance and regulations and how much will be decided by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales. I am not sure how much scope the National Assembly will have, but I assume that the powers are not devolved and that the Secretary of State retains the right to make regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clear guidance is needed to determine the circumstances in which young people can opt out of the system. I imagine that the planning and pathway process would allow a mutual decision to be made that someone would be better supported by the benefits system than by the system in the Bill. However, that would happen only in exceptional circumstances. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight raises an important question, but he does not answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Ceredigion. The amendment would wreck a principle purpose of the Bill, but there will be exceptional circumstances. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight drew attention to one category of circumstances in which it might be appropriate to use the benefits system rather than, or in addition to, the support system, but subsection (3) gives the Secretary of State the scope and power to deal with that issue. We should be asking whether the Government have considered what classes of person they would exclude from the scope of subsection (2) using the powers in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me ask the Minister another question. I notice that powers in subsection (3) exclude from the provisions of the clause people who would otherwise be caught by subsections (2)(a) and (b). Subsection (2)(c) gives an apparently unlimited power to include any other person. Subsections (2)(a) and (b) refer to eligible children and relevant children. Subsection (2)(c) extends the scope of the clause to cover
	<br><blockquote><p>any person of a description prescribed in regulations under subsection (4).</p></blockquote>
That could be significant. What reassurance can the Minister offer that that power will not be used to extend the withdrawal of right to benefit far beyond 16 and 17-year-old eligible and relevant children? I support the Government proposals, but that would take us into a wider field and would be much more controversial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Olner. It is true to say that the amendment would be difficult to accommodate within the main thrust of the Bill, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware. There is more than a slight problem with the amendment—it is pretty full on. As worded, it would have little effect because it is aimed at eligible children: those who remain looked after are not normally entitled to those benefits. I imagine that the hon. Gentleman is more concerned about the relevant child who is 16 or 17 and has left care, although his amendment does not address that group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a major provision; we are making important changes. We all need to be clear about the reasons why we believe that we have outlined the best way in which to support young people in every sense—financially, physically and so on. The local authority will be made the conduit through which local support is delivered to young people, instead of expecting young people to go out and navigate their way around the benefit system as is far too often the case now. I am sure that we are all aware of the way in which the current system can be construed as encouraging local authorities to push children out too early, making them dependent on the benefits system. My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford referred to that issue. At that point, of course, authorities cease to become financially responsible for those young people. We know that that has happened and that the consequences for young people have been disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered carefully those aspects of the current system and consulted extensively in "Me, Survive, Out There?" on the right path down which we should proceed. Generally we got a positive response from the organisations that responded. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight expressed concerns that have been raised in Scotland about the proposals. It is right that concerns have been expressed and we acknowledge them. For the sake of completeness, we should also be prepared to acknowledge the strong support expressed for our proposed changes. I was struck, for example, by what the Foyer Federation said in response to our proposals. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>we warmly welcome the proposal of removing care leavers from the benefits system thus replacing a hugely frustrating and at times baffling process with a more simple one, at a particularly vulnerable time in their lives.</p></blockquote>
I was also struck by the conclusions of a special conference conducted by the children's organisation National Voice to consider the Government's proposals. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>it doesn't matter who gives the money as long as it is easy and straightforward to access and…the agency holding the purse strings can efficiently administer the money.</p></blockquote>
We should consider the matter in the round and recognise that there is substantial support from such bodies as well as from local authorities. We should also be clear about why we are making the changes and removing benefit entitlement from a group of young people: we are doing it to support and to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight asked me several questions about the arrangements and the way in which they would operate. It would be largely true to say that most of the concerns expressed have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
about the way in which the new system will work. Will young people be properly supported? Will there be enough money in the system? My answer is simply that we have made it clear that we want to establish a new ring-fenced budget to support the changes, which will draw in all the money currently being spent by local authorities on young people, together with the money currently being spent by the Department of Social Security through the Benefits Agency on benefits entitlement. In addition, we will include a further sum, which will be made available from the spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the national budget is guaranteed to exceed that which is currently spent. We should all be clear about that. The Government are not taking benefits away from people and providing no support, although that is something to which we previously became accustomed. We are introducing the provisions in the right way and for the right reasons. We want to provide additional support to young people and not penalise them financially. That explains why so much support has been expressed for our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was rightly concerned about arrangements to deal with young people who run away and cease to come under the protective arm of the authority that was previously responsible for them. Such people can find themselves in another city or area without any obvious means of financial support. My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford, who spent a large part of his career working with such young people, will know that children sometimes leave the care of an authority with no notice—they simply get up and go. Such children will remain entitled to emergency help from the authority in the area in which they turn up, but we believe that the new arrangements should make it easier to encourage children to remain within the support arrangements. If a young person wishes to break off contact with his responsible authority, he must do no more than keep in touch with his personal adviser in order to be supported anywhere in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That flexibility is positive and welcome. The new arrangements provide financial support to young care leavers when a relationship breaks down and difficulties arise. We want young people to be properly supported. We only need to imagine that our own children's welfare is at stake. I know that that is an emotive way of dealing with the matter, but it brings it down to a practical level to which we can all relate. If our son or daughter was having difficulty with the local authority, we would not want him or her to be bouncing around, trying to negotiate a way through the benefits system and all the trauma and tribulation that is so often associated with it, especially at a crisis point and at a vulnerable time in their lives. That is the wrong way to deliver financial support to children who are in such a position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not urge my hon. Friends to support the changes we are making if I could not tell them that they improve financial support for young people. The changes will make it easier for young people to obtain the support that they have often lacked in the past, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
they will encourage local authorities to adopt better practices in supporting young people at transitional phases in their lives, when they are reaching towards adulthood and independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge wanted to know who we would exempt from the benefit entitlement provisions and who would retain entitlement. My hon. Friend asked for discretion in relation to lone parents, for example. I have made it clear that we intend to exempt lone parents from the benefit entitlement provisions, as it is right and proper that they should continue to be entitled to benefits. If such a young person was living at home, he or she would continue to be entitled to benefits. That should apply also to young care leavers who are pregnant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister remind the Committee of the percentage of girls leaving care who are either pregnant or are already mothers? I think that he referred to the relevant figures on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have that figure in my head. I have used it previously and I shall try to find my way to it in a moment, but I do not have it immediately to hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the percentage is substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is a substantial figure, but I do not want to trawl my memory to produce a figure that might turn out to be inaccurate. I accept that it is far too high and that it is a matter of considerable concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to trap the Minister with a difficult question, but he has made it clear that the figure is significant. I am told that that the figure is one in seven, which is certainly a substantial proportion. I think that most Committee members agree that the amendment would have adverse consequences for the principles of the Bill. Is not the Minister afraid that an exemption that covers such a large number of care leavers has a detrimental effect on the Bill's overall purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we have considered the matter carefully, and we are satisfied with our conclusions. Many young girls leaving care are pregnant, but I would not want to hazard a guess about the annual number of care leavers. It is about to emerge. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am told that as many as one in four girls who leave care are pregnant. That is a high proportion: it is the equivalent of one in 10 of all care leavers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I almost questioned whether lone parents should be an exempted group. Will the Minister make it clear to local authorities that, even if they do not have a duty to support those young people financially, they still have a duty of care? Having created financial support packages, I am concerned that people will regard them as purely financial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course support is not purely financial. The hon. Gentleman seems to think that if we allow relevant children to retain benefit entitlement, they will somehow cease to be considered relevant for the purposes of the Bill. They will not. Support can continue to be provided, particularly through the young person's adviser, the pathway plan and other aspects of the Bill. That is where we draw the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I get the impression that the hon. Gentleman wants us to exempt lone parents from their benefit entitlement. I tried to explain why we thought that would be unfair. If such young people were living with their natural parents, they would be entitled to benefits under existing arrangements. We believe that, whenever possible, the treatment of care leavers and other young people should be conterminous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the principles of equity that drive the Minister, but I am deeply troubled by what he says. Has he given any thought to what message is sent to young girls aged 15 in local authority care their co-residents in the children's home and others who are pregnant will anticipate receiving benefit because of the exemption, but those who are not pregnant will not expect benefits? I might be rather optimistic, but unless the Minister believes that most young people will not think of the withdrawal of cash benefits as a negative feature—rightly or wrongly, I rather suspect that they will—does he not fear that the signal sent will be a negative one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it will. The hon. Gentleman asks me to explain some complex issues about human motivation. I am not convinced that young women will get pregnant because they might then be entitled to income support. That is not likely to be a reason why young women in care get pregnant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not say that in as many words, but he implied that the availability of cash benefits would send a signal to young people so that if they became pregnant they might say, "Whoopee-do, we'll have piles of money thrown at us by the benefit system." That is not the experience of the benefits system. Retaining the entitlement to benefit will not cause problems in administering the new scheme. The principle of equity is important, at least to my hon. Friends, and we do not intend to remove the benefit entitlement for lone parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford that we are sure that it would be appropriate to exempt disabled children from the provision. They, too, will continue to be entitled to benefits when they leave care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked me how we would use the regulation-making power, and I gave two examples of what we envisage. I can sense from his body language that he feels that we should exempt benefits from those two categories. Perhaps we should debate that subject at some future time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
Yes, we are making important changes. We are taking away a benefit entitlement from a particular group of young people, but we are not doing that to put them at a material disadvantage. Far from it; we are making sure that the money stays in the system, we are adding additional resources and I am sure that the end result will be a better set of mechanisms for supporting young people who leave care at a critical time in their lives, making it easier for them to obtain the assistance and support, including financial support, that they need to make the adjustment to independent living. We do that in a genuine desire to support those young people at a crucial time in their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the full extent of our motivation. There are no other agendas involved. Having considered the failures and weaknesses of the present system, we know that it cries out for such a change, so we are making it. The technical deficiency of the amendment rather negates its purpose, and applying the provision to relevant children in the way in which the hon. Gentleman suggests would substantially compromise our ability to deliver our effective support mechanism. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford said, it might encourage a continuation of the bad practice that has been such a hallmark of the system to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear about it: the system has failed to support people properly, so the idea that the benefits system holds out a better prospect to a disaffected young care leaver than the new arrangements is wrong. I do not subscribe to the view that the benefits system has succeeded in properly providing the right support for young people, which is why we are making the changes. I hope that we are doing so with strong support from at least all my hon. Friends and, I hope, most Opposition members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last remarks were right. We understand what the Government are doing in excluding 16 and 17-year-olds from cash benefits, and we support them in that. We also understand the need to allow people in specific cases to carry on receiving benefits, as that will sometimes be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to what the Minister said, I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of an exemption from the general arrangement that will extend to as many as one in seven or eight of all care leavers, if I have understood the arithmetic correctly. That sends some strange messages. I do not suggest that 15-year-old girls in care will automatically think that they have one year left in which to become pregnant, but there will be serious consequences to anything that seems to people's peers, however misguidedly, to reward them for a type of behaviour that we would not seek to encourage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman hear my hon. Friend the Minister when he said that the finance available for the transfer would be the benefits plus additional money from the comprehensive spending
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
review? It follows that there may be a disincentive, if one takes the hon. Gentleman's argument, to become pregnant or receive benefits, because the benefits may be less than the young people would receive in a care home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. If the package on offer were for those who "behaved", were looked after and remained eligible children rather than relevant children, that would be a different matter. I did not hear the Minister holding that out as a specific prospect. If that was because I was not listening properly, he will correct me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford has pointed to the solution to the dilemma. Although defending the decision that has been taken and the way in which the Bill is presented, I suggest that the Minister understands the concerns and may feel some of them himself. I judge that from his body language. We would not normally feel comfortable taking such action. Everything hinges on the perception of the child. It may be mistaken for the child to think that the cash benefits available in the social security system are preferable to being properly looked after and accommodated by a local authority. If the child perceives that the benefit would be better and that it would somehow be negative to have it taken away, we shall have all sorts of problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford may have suggested a way in which to resolve those problems, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight for bringing the matter to the Committee's attention. We will want to explore it further on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about the potentially wide scope of the regulation-making power in subsection (2)(c) and whether we could use it to exempt anyone that we chose. The answer is clearly no, because the provision is tied in clearly to subsection (4). In fact, we will use it to implement the changes for Scotland when the necessary legislation is in place there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for making that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been an extremely useful debate. We have teased out an issue that is not apparent in the wording of the Bill by asking the Minister to check the percentage of people who might be exempted as a result of the proposed arrangements. From that, we have learnt that it would not be the odd, occasional person but a significant proportion of the relevant children. The Committee and the House will want to consider carefully the consequences of the measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, a dangerous amendment concentrates the debate, and I appreciate the contributions that have been made. I am still not sure what arrangements will be made to cover the—roughly—2 per cent. of care leavers who are disaffected and present a difficulty. I hope that the Government will create some flexible arrangements to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
ensure that emergency help can be given, through the Benefits Agency, local social services or the voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt the motivation behind the Bill, which represents a tremendous step forward, and would not want to be part of anything that undermines it. To return to the point about the exemptions suggested in the explanatory notes. Would it not be a good way forward to consider an extra benefit for a young parent or disabled person, in recognition of their special need for emotional and financial support? I fear that a local authority might not be as interested or as rigorous in maintaining contacts with those two categories, whose need may be greater than average, if its role does not involve the disbursement of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been useful and we will learn more when the Bill is enacted and applied. Not all relevant children have the same needs, and I hope that the Minister, in using his powers, recognises that one set of regulations may not meet the needs of all. I beg to ask leave to withdraw this dangerous amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important group of amendments, which deals with what I have described as the hybridity in the Bill. It is so complex because, for the most part, it deals with matters of devolved responsibility to Scotland. The clause deals with a matter that relates to the whole United Kingdom, which is therefore reserved for this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about eligible or relevant children, not people over 18. I shall call amendment No. 14 the double-dipping amendment. It is designed to tackle the concern that a person should not be able to have the support of a local authority as set out in proposed new section 23B(8) of the Children Act 1989, with which we are all now familiar, and also be able to claim means-tested benefits such as jobseeker's allowance, income support or housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might think that that situation would not arise by virtue of the exclusion of 16 and 17-year-olds from benefit under clause 6. Most of the Bill applies only to England and Wales, but clause 6 applies to the whole United Kingdom. How do the Government think that they will get round that problem? They cannot control business in Edinburgh. Perhaps the Minister is privy to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
some information and can tell me that, by the time this legislation is on the statute book, similar legislation will be on the statute book in Scotland. That would render our debate of no practical significance, but I think that it would none the less be a fascinating constitutional debate—although I can see that not everyone might be so fascinated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal to deal with the problem is to introduce, through subsection (7), a power to make regulations, so that there could be different provisions for different areas. That seems to be a fundamental attack on one of the pillars of the devolution settlement. The main purpose of reserving matters such as social security to this Parliament is to ensure their uniformity across the United Kingdom, so that there will not be differential benefits payable in Scotland, England and Wales. By giving themselves powers to make regulations that put different regimes in place in Scotland and England, the Government undermine the fundamental distinction between reserved and devolved powers. That step would logically lead to the argument that, if we are not to have uniform benefits available across the UK, one might as well devolve social security responsibility to the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 would strike out subsection (7). It would not replace it directly, but it would deal with the problem that I have identified, which arises from a disparity in timing between legislation in England and Scotland. It assumes a situation in which the Bill is in force in England and the Government are anxious to bring it into effect, but are unable to persuade the Scottish Executive to pass a similar measure in Scotland, minus clause 6, which will not be needed there. In that situation, the positive side of the Bill, which is all the additional support being made available to help relevant and eligible children, would be in place in Scotland before the negative side—if I may describe it as such; the phrase is not intended to be pejorative—removes the benefits that would have been necessary in the absence of the duties that the Bill places on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would tackle that problem through amendment No. 15, which would simply specify that the Bill, or at least clause 6, could not be brought into effect until similar legislation is on the statute book in Scotland to give effect to clauses 1 to 5, 7 and 8. In other words, it would mean that a regime must be in place throughout the United Kingdom to provide additional local authority support for the children affected before the Government can withdraw the benefits that are currently available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the right way to approach the matter. The Government's chosen route of making different social security arrangements for England and Scotland is not a principled response. It is merely an expedient response that recognises the Government's inability to control business in Edinburgh and could give rise to the problem of double-dipping that is identified in amendment No. 14. If means-tested cash benefits continue to be available for 16 and 17-year-olds in Scotland but not in England, nothing in the Bill will prevent a young person or child from receiving
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
support from a local authority in England as a relevant child and going to Scotland to claim those benefits in Scotland. On Second Reading, I envisaged floods of people on the west coast main line from London to Glasgow. That might be stretching the bounds of probability, but I can easily envisage Glasgow or Edinburgh becoming magnets for young people, in the way that London is now, if cash benefits are available there that are not available in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more realistic example might be someone from the Minister's constituency, not far from the Scottish border, who might be tempted to exploit the differential in the regimes in force on either side of the border. It seems a dangerous precedent to allow the Government to make arrangements for Scotland that differ from those that apply in England and Wales, rather than tackling the fundamental problem, which is that the Bill cannot work properly until similar legislation is introduced in Scotland, because social security is a reserved matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three amendments would prevent double-dipping by requiring the Government to secure legislation in Scotland to introduce a similar regime to that which applies in England and Wales and to have a big bang to bring the relevant Acts into force throughout the United Kingdom in one go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the double-dipping amendment. On Second Reading, I thought that it related to the Meriden to Musselburgh theory, but perhaps for the hon. Gentleman it is the Runnymede to Roxburgh theory—the idea that hordes of young people will grasp hands and say, "You take the high road and I'll take the low road, and I'll be in the Scottish benefits office before you." I do not believe that that will happen. I cannot think of an earthly reason why they would want to leave Barrow, given the excellent representation that I am sure that they receive from my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment exposes the Tories' dislike of devolution and lack of confidence in the Scottish Parliament to make suitable provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The route that the Government are taking betrays a certain lack of confidence in their ability to persuade the Scottish Parliament to pass the necessary legislation in a timely fashion. If they had that confidence, they would have no need for subsection (7) and our worries would melt away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. The Scottish Parliament will make the necessary arrangements. Of course, young people must provide certain information when claiming benefits. A young person could not just wander into the Glasgow benefits office, put on a Scottish accent and try to claim benefit. Checks will be made and, if a young person cannot provide such information, he will not receive the benefit. It will not be long before the Scottish Parliament resolves the issue. It will do so in its own way and in its own time, which is what devolution is about. The double-dipping that the hon. Gentleman referred to will not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend because he delivered some cracking lines that, unfortunately, I do not have. There are two ways in which to handle the amendments: we can examine them line by line and nit-pick our way through, spotting the occasional technical deficiency, or we can argue the case full on. I prefer the latter option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge must ask himself whether the changes in England and Wales should be delayed until similar legislation is introduced in Scotland, or whether we should implement them as soon as possible. We shall have to come to terms with the fact that there may be a transitional period until similar changes can take place in Scotland—or should the legislation be enacted in one big bang?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I detect that the Minister does not share the confidence of the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford in the willingness of the Scottish Parliament to enact appropriate legislation speedily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. There is a choice to be made. We shall argue about the length of the transitional period, but either we adopt the hon. Gentleman's solution and delay the introduction of the changes in England or we enact them all in one go. I have been in communication with the Scottish Minister about the matter and I know that there will be an opportunity in the next Session of the Scottish Parliament for legislation to be introduced to make similar changes in Scotland. That would be welcome, and it is a matter entirely for the Scottish Parliament and for the Scottish Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said once or twice that we were in such a position because we could not control the business in Edinburgh. Well, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford was right to draw attention to that aspect of his remarks because they were not entirely consistent with our understanding of the spirit of devolution. It is not the business of the Government to dictate to the Scottish Executive or the Scottish Parliament. All matters in Scotland are entirely the business of the Scottish Parliament—that is the spirit of devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If memory serves me correctly, there is still a Scottish Labour party and it might be reasonable to expect that the agenda of the Labour party in England would be co-ordinated with that of the Labour party in Scotland. Can the Minister confirm that there is no cross-party consensus on clause 6 in Scotland, as there is in England? Although the Scottish Parliament will no doubt consider the matter in the not-too-distant future, it is not certain to have as a smooth ride as it has in the Westminster Parliament on the basis of cross-party consensus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are disagreements in Scotland; that is a matter of public record, so I do not know why the hon. Gentleman wants me to confirm that—it is hardly news. The decision is for the Scottish

Parliament to take and I have absolute confidence that my hon. Friend the Minister for Children and Education will make a convincing case to the Scottish Parliament on why the changes should be made. The Scottish Parliament will have an opportunity to debate the necessary legislative changes in Scotland soon. The Scottish Executive intend to legislate at the earliest opportunity, so a short transition period is likely; therefore, I am not persuaded that we should delay the benefits of the Bill for children who are looked after by English local authorities. We should proceed with implementing the legislation in England, where transitional arrangements will be necessary for what I hope will be a short period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman explained his double-dipping argument on Second Reading, but I find it no more convincing today than I did then. My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford dealt with most of the hon. Gentleman's arguments. Suffice it to say, it is implausible to suppose that there will be an exodus of children from the care of English authorities because of the supposed advantages of the benefits system in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to draw a distinction between what he thinks might happen and the principle involved. Let us set aside amendments Nos. 13 and 15, which deal with separate arrangements for Scotland. What does he object to in amendment No. 14? It seems a perfectly unexceptionable amendment, which states what I assume to be the Government's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the amendment would make sure that English care leavers who are supported under the Bill would be unable to claim benefits anywhere in the United Kingdom. It would make no difference to Scottish care leavers. I am therefore not sure that I follow the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that I am trying to make is a simple one that addresses the choices that we have to make. I am sure that our approach to the Bill is right. I cannot logically dispute the hon. Gentleman's argument that we are proceeding on a different time scale. Assuming that the Scottish Parliament approves it, the legislation in Scotland will almost certainly kick in later than the equivalent legislation in England. There is no point in denying that, as that is the purpose of the provisions to which he has drawn attention. However, that does not drive a constitutional hole through the devolution settlement; it does not fundamentally compromise in any way, shape or form the principle of devolved and reserved matters. We are trying to develop the proposals in a way that makes perfect logical sense and is consistent with the principle of the devolved settlement that now governs the administration of the United Kingdom. I can understand why the hon. Gentleman might make such arguments for political reasons, but they do not add up to a row of beans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to treat that last remark as a political statement, which is impossible to verify. If we are discussing a power to create different regimes in Scotland and England in what is supposed to be a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
reserved matter, what is the purpose of keeping social security as a reserved matter? I understood that it was reserved because the Government wanted to have a uniform regime of benefits across the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that, and that is why social security is a reserved matter. I accept that the solution to the problem seems novel, but the argument that we must address is simple. It involves the timing of the introduction of the legislation and the immediate benefits that it will bring to English care leavers. The hon. Gentleman's solution is to delay the introduction of the Bill until equivalent changes have been made in Scotland. That may be a reasonable argument, but I do not think that English care leavers should experience that kind of delay. We should go ahead and introduce the legislation in England in a way that is fundamentally compatible with the spirit of devolution. The hon. Gentleman's argument has no substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Labour Members remain deeply sceptical about his party's commitment to devolution and those of us who have to deal with such matters in Committee and elsewhere constantly come across the type of argument that now confronts me. Conservatives say that they believe in devolution, but then they nit-pick their way through Bills, advancing all sorts of arguments that imply the opposite. The hon. Gentleman's comment that the Government in London are unable to control business in Edinburgh gave the game away. I think that the hon. Gentleman said that there was still a Conservative party in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He may have referred to the Labour party in Scotland, which is substantially larger than the party that he represents. We have strong and substantial relations with our colleagues in the Scottish Executive who, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, are doing an excellent job of governing the affairs of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friends not to accept the amendment. Let us speed the Bill through Committee, so that we can start to implement the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party in Scotland may have larger representation than the Conservative party but, given the direction in which the parties are travelling, I know on which party I would put my money in the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's whole argument smacks of expediency; I have heard nothing of principle. Why make social security a reserved matter if one is going to dip into the principle of uniform benefits whenever it is convenient to do so? I do not want to be cast in the role of arguing for a delay in implementation of the Bill, but I am obliged to state a problem that the devolution settlement creates for hybrid Bills such as this—Bills that have a part requiring legislation in Scotland and a part that can be dealt with on a United Kingdom basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V001P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lords Commissioner to the Treasury (Mr. David Jamieson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a hybrid Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since seeing the Bill, I have made a conscious decision to use the term hybrid because there is no better term to describe a Bill dealing partly with reserved matters and partly with devolved matters. Clearly, such a Bill creates specific difficulties. It is not a hybrid Bill in the conventional sense of combining public and private business, but it is one in the post-devolution sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has seven clauses relating to devolved matters and one relating to a reserved matter. The issue will probably arise in other areas of business dealing with devolved matters that require changes in the social security regime or other reserved areas. I understand the Minister's obvious reluctance to delay the implementation in England and Wales simply to accommodate a delay in Scotland, but I reject his claim that it is inimical to the devolution settlement to expect the party in control of Government in England and Wales to negotiate with the same party that has effective control of Government in Scotland to ensure that legislation is co-ordinated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where it is necessary to have legislation in both parts of the country to make it effective, as is the case with this legislation, it creates a precedent that is quite dangerous in the long run to put short-term expediency ahead of important constitutional principles. Subsection (7) constitutes an important departure from the established reasoning behind social security being a reserved matter. However, I do not wish to appear, or to allow myself to be cast by anyone with ulterior motives, as wanting to delay the implementation of the Bill. In fact, I would like the Government to speed up the implementation of the appropriate legislation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will withdraw the amendment, but the issue has not gone away and I have not been satisfied by the answers. I need to consider our approach to the issue and reflect, between now and Report stage, on any developments in Scotland, so that we can look again at how we might create, as soon as possible, a uniform situation throughout the UK. The Minister talks about a transitional period, but if, as he says, he has no control over the business in Scotland, he cannot be sure that that will occur. There could be a permanent settlement whereby separate social security regimes in Scotland and in England and Wales are created. I do not think that that will be satisfactory. However, developments over the summer may reassure us on the situation in Scotland before we return to the issue on Report, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
