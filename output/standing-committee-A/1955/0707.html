	<p>Resolved,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Agriculture (Improvement of Roads) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Nugent</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment I would draw the attention of the Committee to the Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill. I do not propose to read it, but copies of it are on the table for any member of the Committee who would like one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF ROADS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. R. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 8, after the first "county" to insert "or district."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to call the attention of the Committee to the fact that this Amendment is tied up with that to Clause 3, line 3, after "county" insert "or district," and that to Clause 5, page 4, line 29, after "highway" insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in the case of an unadopted road the district council in whose area the road is located."</p></blockquote>
If the first Amendment were not accepted by the Committee I would not move the other Amendments, as they are consequential on the acceptance of the first one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations have been made to me by a large cross-section of those who live in the County of Aberdeen that it would be desirable, if possible, to bring the district councils into the picture in this Bill. The Bill, as it stands unamended, proposes that the grants shall be administered and applied solely by the county councils, and, having studied all the proposals of the probable size of the grants and, indeed, the nature of the work that will be carried out on non-adopted roads rather than on classified roads, it seems to me that there is a case for the inclusion of district councils since they have
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
so much more intimate knowledge of the precise conditions prevailing in their areas and what benefits might come from a modest application of some of these grants to improve and bring up to standard roads at present almost unusable. I hope that when the Minister replies he will indicate that this can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the Amendment is perfect, but it may be that other means can be used for bringing the district councils into the picture. I would be grateful to the Minister if he would consider this problem and indicate to the Committee whether it is possible to include district councils within the scope of the present Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Niall Macpherson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Spence) for the very moderate way in which he moved this Amendment, but I am afraid that I could not recommend the Committee to accept it, at any rate in its present form. I hope, however, that what I say will satisfy him. As the Amendment is drafted, the question it poses is whether this Bill should confer on district councils a share of the responsibility for submitting proposals for improvement of unadopted roads for the benefit of livestock rearing areas. Nobody would deny the good work that the district councils have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble is that the Amendment as drafted would give parallel powers—I will not call them equal powers—to the district councils with the county councils and this could give rise to some confusion. There is nothing in the Bill as it stands which would prevent the district councils taking some part in this Bill provided that the county councils delegate powers to them. In other words, as my hon. Friend has put it, there is nothing to prevent them being brought into the picture. But what my hon. Friend is asking us to accept is that a district council should have this power even if a county council is unwilling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment also seeks to confer totally new powers on district councils. In fact, this Bill confers no new powers on any Scottish authority, and we do not regard this small but useful Measure as a proper vehicle for extension of powers in general. My hon. Friend will know that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
district councils have a permissive power but not a duty under Section 29 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1894, to prepare and maintain public ways which are not highways on the county council lists. Therefore they are excluded in any case from the unclassified roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know my hon. Friend has in mind unadopted roads, and I know he appreciates that the Amendment in its present form, if it were carried, would lead to a lot of other Amendments having to be made. The Amendment would make the district council a highway authority, which would be a new departure, in respect of roads which they had improved under the Bill. It would, in fact, increase their burdens—it would not lighten them—whereas this Bill to some extent will lead to a lightening of the burden through the adoption of unadopted roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, it would not confer any additional financial resources upon district councils in order to fulfil their responsibility. Some district councils are already levying rates to the limit of their capacity, that is, up to 1s. which is the limit of their capacity to levy rates. This Amendment would confer new powers. It is the county council and not the district council which has a duty to maintain highways. Under this Bill the unadopted road which is improved is taken into the county council list of highways and so becomes the responsibility of the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand my hon. Friend's Amendment, what he would wish to do is to have a district list of highways as well as a county council list. In other words, it would be an entirely new departure. But the county council can delegate this function, or it can ask the district council to contribute voluntarily to the improvement of the roads, as is done at present in the case of the Highlands. There is nothing whatever to prevent district councils putting up proposals to the county councils for roads to be improved under this Bill, but we do not think that it should be the district council which should put the proposals to the Secretary of State, because in the first place this would mean duplication and overlapping; secondly, it would involve what are really fundamental changes in the present system of responsibility for highways; thirdly, it would almost certainly necessitate some amendment in the powers of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
district authorities to levy rates which would be quite outside the scope of this Bill; and, lastly, the system has worked quite well in the Highlands under the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act and we believe it will work well also in the Bill as now drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say one other word to my hon. Friend. Although we do not suggest that the Committee should accept this Amendment, if he will move his second Amendment at a later stage, between now and then we shall be giving it consideration. I would not, therefore, suggest that he should decline to move the other Amendments, but I would ask him to withdraw this particular one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Joint Under-Secretary of State has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment, and in doing so I should like to thank him for his appreciation of this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sidney Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 14, after "council" to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the County Agricultural Executive Committee."</p></blockquote>
This is the first important Amendment to which we must give consideration. There was every indication that this Bill was hastily drawn up as a result of the recommendations of the Council for Wales and Monmouth. In moving the Second Reading of the Bill the Minister indicated that he had only a hazy idea as to how the Bill would be administered and how schemes would be put forward and considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading debate my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts) specifically asked him whether schemes put forward by the county councils would be referred to the county agricultural executive committees. The Minister in reply merely said, "Well, of course, we can consult anybody." But a very important matter is whether, before any particular scheme or road improvement in these areas is submitted to the Minister, the agricultural executive committee should have a full opportunity of looking at it and assessing the benefit, if any, which would accrue to agriculture from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no mention in the Bill of agricultural committees. It is very important to know whether it is the intention of the Government to make full use of these committees and, indeed, of the district sub-committees. I should say that the county agricultural executive committees are gradually being put to sleep. It would be no exaggeration to say that the district committees have already gone to sleep. They are performing no useful function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that the sole authority for submitting a scheme to the Minister will be the county council, so the first schemes will undoubtedly be those which county councils, or their officials, or perhaps individual county councillors, have had in mind for some time. The main purpose of those schemes may not be the benefit of agriculture, but the opening up of roads through the hills so that charabanc parties may be taken round, or for some other such purposes. It has already been indicated that a very large mileage of roads ought to come under the Bill. On this side of the Committee we are concerned that schemes shall be for the benefit of people engaged in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is mention of another authority, the Forestry Commission. It may well be that schemes pushed forward to share in this meagre £4 million will be those of Forestry Commission officials, to the detriment of agriculture. We want agricultural committees to be brought into the picture at the beginning, so that we shall all be sure that the first consideration in the sharing out the money is to assist those who are endeavouring to produce more food and cattle in difficult areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to avoid the Forestry Commission's getting the lion's share of this meagre £4 million, the agricultural executive committees should be stimulated to much greater activity than they have shown in the last few years. They must have the power not merely of consulting county councils but of initiating schemes. They should be able to vet schemes from the agricultural point of view. We could then all be sure that agricultural interests will not be secondary to the interests of people who may be serving with every good intent on a county council, but desire to have certain
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
roads improved, although the purpose may be something other than purely agricultural. The agricultural committees will know the likely future developments in their areas, and they would ensure that the improvement of a road would not be an isolated incident but would be linked up with local agricultural development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commision may be looking with longing eyes for certain areas to fall right into their hands for development for forestry purposes if they can get a road put there. We are concerned that the agricultural interest should be predominant. Agricultural executive committees should be alerted from the start and should have the chance to initiate, or in conjunction with the county council to put forward, schemes that will immediately benefit those who are struggling against adversity in the difficult areas. The result would be immediate agricultural benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's Amendment. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary will have to give us an explanation in order to make clear to highway authorities what machinery they have for consulting the Ministry of Agriculture when putting forward schemes. Will that machinery be the local agricultural executive committee's, or the land commission which has now access to the county council, through its smallholdings committee? We have no information so far on that point, and I have seen no statement on the matter in the eulogy which has been given in Wales to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission may well have greater priority in these schemes, unless something to the contrary is stated by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary. I am a member of a county council. Fortunately for me, I am an alderman and do not have to attend the meetings so regularly as an elected person, but I take an interest in highway matters. The county council has not the same information as the Minister of Agriculture is certain to have about the definition of livestock areas. Areas must have been mapped out in the Ministry of Agriculture to which the scheme will apply, but county councils will not have this information, so there will have to be some kind of liaison between highway authorities and the Ministry of Agriculture.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
This is a very important point. It may well be that highway authority schemes put forward after consultation with the elected representatives will go to the Ministry of Agriculture, and then be put on one side because they do not come within the definition which is in the mind of the Minister and which may not be in the minds of local farmers and others interested in these matters. We should like to have a long explanation from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary how this machinery will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not too long, but putting once and for all what machinery is to be set up for proper examination of these schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rupert Speir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reference has been made to how the Forestry Commission is to be treated in the allocation of grants. In Northumberland the Commission has something like 100,000 acres. The Bill is extremely useful, but it is very small, while the number of miles of road to be covered is very large. We do not want the Forestry Commission, which has funds from its own resources for building its roads, to swallow a large part of the limited funds provided under the Bill. I hope that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will be able to reassure us on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. G. R. H. Nugent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with most of the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Norfolk, Southwest (Mr. Dye) but not quite all of them, and by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins), about the necessity for the agricultural interest being the main one when determining whether or not improvement grants are to be given for this purpose. That is certainly the intention of my right hon. Friend. May I say on behalf of my right hon. Friend how much he regrets that he is not able to be here at the beginning of this Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He must be an alderman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He probably would be glad to have the privileges of an alderman. He will join us later and, of course, he has the closest interest in the business before us. The agricultural
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
interest is the prime one which will determine whether or no schemes will be approved. It certainly will be the intention of my right hon. Friend to consult agricultural executive committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be possible for county agricultural executive committees to initiate schemes, as the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West suggested, because they are the agents of my right hon. Friend. It would be like the Minister proposing a scheme to himself. The initiative must remain, I think properly, with the county council, which is the highway authority; but I do not doubt that farmers in the neighbourhood will have their own views and feelings about the work required, and that they will be well able to make their views heard and understood in their county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the county council is considering making a proposal for the improvement of a road it will naturally want technical assistance, which the agricultural executive committee will be able to give. Such assistance is needed in determining the exact definition of a "livestock-rearing" area so as to know whether the proposal comes technically within the terms of the Bill. The council will probably want advice about the structural necessities of the road and the standard necessary to deal with the traffic passing over it to meet the needs of the neighbourhood. Technical advice of that kind would be readily available from the agricultural committee, either from its advisory service or its land service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county council would formally submit its proposal to my right hon. Friend. At that stage, when my right hon. Friend was considering whether or no he could approve the scheme for grant, he would consult the agricultural executive committee on the agricultural merits of the proposal. Naturally my right hon. Friend and the Secretary of State for Scotland will wish to have the views of the agricultural committees on those merits and any particular local considerations of a farming nature. In practice, the wishes of hon. and right hon. Members opposite will be met by the procedure we propose to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent</i>.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We intend to have very full regard to, and shall indeed depend to a very large extent on, the views of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
agricultural executive committees and they will undoubtedly be called into consultation at the technical level by county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission barely comes into the Amendment. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Speir), I would point out that the Commission stands exactly as any other agricultural interest. If it has views it must make them known to the local county council. It will then be for the county council to take those views into account like those of other agricultural interests concerned. If the county council thinks an improvement of a highway is warranted mainly to serve forestry interests, it will go ahead. I give the assurance that my right hon. Friend will be careful to ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the agricultural and the forestry interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite will be satisfied that we propose in spirit to do what they are asking, and that they will therefore be willing to withdraw their Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) thinks after hearing that reply, but personally I do not feel content that the Parliamentary Secretary should be allowed to think that he has given any kind of answer. The Bill is in any case a wretched little abortion. Nevertheless, we want to do what we can to make it grow up a little less mis-shapen and a little more dignified and useful than was suggested by its appearance at birth, and one way in which we can make it useful is to make sure that in determining whether schemes shall be put up to the Minister there shall be some competent authority at the beginning which can advise on the question of the agricultural considerations which arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an old practice of Ministers to say that they will do in every Bill what does not appear in the Bill. Neither when I was in office nor since have I understood why I was always regularly advised to assure the House of Commons that we would do everything which was not in the Bill but for some extraordinary reason we had put the exact opposite in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
If the Parliamentary Secretary is to consult the C.A.E.C.s, and if in fact the determining advice as to whether the agricultural considerations required in the Bill are met is to be given to the Minister by the C.A.E.C.s, I cannot see what the objection is to saying so in the Bill so that the county councils know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the situation which the Parliamentary Secretary so happily envisages. Let us assume that the Bill becomes an Act and goes to the county councils. Clause 1 (2) will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Act applies to any improvement of a road in the case of which it appears to the council proposing the improvement—
	<ol>
	<li>that the road is situated in, or affords access to, a livestock rearing area, and</li>
	<li>that the improvement would promote the use, or the more efficient use, of land in that area for any purpose of agriculture or forestry."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The important phrase is
	<br><blockquote><p>"appears to the council proposing the improvement."</p></blockquote>
But the Parliamentary Secretary says, "Never mind about that. Under Clause 1 (3) my right hon. Friend can consult the C.A.E.C.s, even though they are not mentioned." The C.A.E.C. may say one of several things. It may say that the road does not afford access to a livestock rearing area or that, even though it does, the improvement would not promote the use,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or the more efficient use, of land in that area."</p></blockquote>
As a consequence, the Minister would disallow the scheme. There are many grounds on which he could disallow it. One is that it would possibly be uneconomic to allow the scheme. Knowing the ways of Ministers, I imagine that he will not disclose the grounds on which he has disallowed it. The county council will have gone to all this trouble to bring forward a scheme in accordance with the Bill which says, specifically and without exempting words, that the council must be satisfied about the agricultural value of the scheme and must be satisfied that the road leads to a livestock rearing area. Having gone to all that trouble to get the scheme to the Minister, the council will be informed that the Minister has disallowed it on the advice of a body which is not mentioned in the Act, and which to the county council is therefore anonymous. The scheme will be disallowed on the advice of a body, which, as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Parliamentary Secretary has said, is the agent of the Minister, and all the county council's work will have been abortive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does anybody imagine that that will add to the harmony of nations in the areas in which the schemes are promoted? Does anybody imagine that the Welsh counties will be thrilled when, having thought they were getting a lot out of the Bill, having consulted all sorts of people—even though they are not obliged to do so under the Bill—and having spent a lot of money on the preparatory work, they find that the Minister in England—for in the case of Wales it will not be the distinguished Minister for Wales but will be an English Minister—disallows the scheme on the grounds that it was not for the council to decide after all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that such a situation will cause a great deal of trouble and that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider it seriously. If the Minister is to consult his C.A.E.C.s, the time to consult them is at the very beginning of the operation. If anybody is to say whether the improvement of a road will benefit agriculture surely the C.A.E.C. is a better body to say it than the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never achieved the distinction of being an alderman and of having a privilege such as that enjoyed by the Secretary of State for Scotland—permanently allowed not to attend the House or its Committees; but for a long time I was secretary to a group of councillors on an important county council in the south of England. County councils are excellent bodies and often there are farmers on them. I do not know what happens in Wales, but it is not unknown in our county council for farmers to be members. Nevertheless, even when farmers are members, it would be absurd to say that that turns the county council into a competent body to decide on the agricultural considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that county councils do not meet very often. Normally, relatively few people do the continuing work of the county councils, and in most county councils a considerable amount of responsibility, in many cases a disproportionate amount, is placed on the officials. These decisions will therefore be taken on allegedly agricultural
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
grounds by people who are not agriculturalists and who have no great claim to be agriculturalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us that the right body to decide whether the work will benefit the land or "the more efficient use" of the land, or whether it gives access to a livestock rearing area, is the county agricultural executive committee, the body which the Minister created for that very purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it was not the present Minister who created the A.E.C.s; they were inherited from the Labour Government, as all good things were inherited from us. Not only is that the right body to consult, but the right time at which to consult it is before the scheme is under way and before the money is wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear what my hon. Friends have to say on this subject, but my general inclination is to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that he has not answered the main point of the Amendment. He has not said why the C.A.E.C.s will not be consulted at the beginning instead of when all the money has been spent on the preparation of the schemes. Secondly, he has not said why he should write into the Act that it is a matter for the county council to determine and then tell the Committee—which will never be evidence again—that, in fact, it is a matter for the Minister and the C.A.E.C. He has not said why the Act should not be written in the terms in which he intends to administer it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, he has not dealt with a point which worries many of us—that the county agricultural executive committees have become more and more an object of derision and scorn on the benches opposite in the last three years. They have been derided there, they are not liked there, everything is being done there to whittle down the standing and powers of the committees. I suspect that the decision not to include them in the Bill is because hon. Members opposite do not want to do anything which gives additional reasons for keeping the C.A.E.C.s in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only ground on which the Parliamentary Secretary sought to answer my hon. Friend was when he said that the C.A.E.C.s cannot promote schemes because that would be the Minister promoting to himself. Unless my memory deserts me, that is not strictly in accordance with the way in which the duties of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
the C.A.E.C.s have been interpreted over the last 15 years. If my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West and the Parliamentary Secretary can keep the debate doing long enough, I shall be able to think of a number of enabling Acts passed by the Labour Government in which the whole of the initiating process was with the C.A.E.C.s. The fact that they were the Minister's agents was never held to disable them from exercising those functions, nor should it disable them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary must address himself to the problem. If he cannot give us a better answer and cannot tell us why he should not have his consultation at the beginning instead of six months or a year too late, then I hope that my hon. Friend and, indeed, hon. Members opposite, too, on what is essentially a matter of efficient administration and cutting out waste and irritation, will feel inclined to press the Parliamentary Secretary beyond his instructions, if he is unable to depart from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have put our fingers on the first fatal flaw in this little Bill, for the Parliamentary Secretary has made it quite clear that the agricultural executive committees cannot come into the picture until after the county council has initiated a scheme. It could very well be that the Minister would receive a number of schemes from the county councils which would absorb the whole of the money set aside for this purpose. Then, back in the counties, the C.A.E.C.s, which have been dealing with agriculture for some time, will know of other roads of greater importance than those which have been put to the Minister but will have no power to initiate schemes in connection with them or to make recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore appears that the Minister, in his office in Whitehall, could be dealing with schemes as they are sent to him without knowing whether there are more urgent or more important roads which he is not considering. I have always understood that the first function of the agricultural executive committees was to be the eyes and ears of the Minister in the areas which they cover and to look out for points on which they could advise him in his activities to stimulate greater agricultural production. For the purposes of this Bill, however, they are blind, they are deaf, they are not in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I have graduated, like my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins), as a county alderman, and I have served for over 20 years on a county council; and from my experience I want to illustrate the weakness here. The Parliamentary Secretary knows about the position of the Fen roads in Norfolk. He knows that the agricultural executive committee is aware of the need to maintain those roads and he is fully aware that the authority which prevents anything from being done to them is the Norfolk County Council, of which I am a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to cast any slur on anybody, but I can tell the Committee that one county alderman, who saw those roads being constructed when he was a member of the agricultural executive committee as well as a member of the county council, has said that in his opinion and in the opinion of the technical officers of the highway authority they were not properly constructed. He says that he will prevent the county council from ever taking over those roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These roads have since been handed over to the Littleport Internal Drainage Committee. The area covered by that drainage committee goes over two counties, the Isle of Ely and Norfolk. In the Isle of Ely, the county council has already accepted responsibility for those roads, so that in a sense the drainage committee has a divided area and is unable to carry out the functions placed upon it in respect of these roads. The roads in a large part of its area have been transferred to the county council and it would not be wise to attempt to levy a rate on the whole area for the purpose of maintaining these roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have an illustration of where a county council would not take the initiative in transferring these particular roads to their authority because they could not get agreement on how they should be transferred or on how they should be maintained afterwards. If similar cases exist in the areas for which this Bill is intended to bring about improvements, unless the agricultural executive committees can be brought in at the beginning in consultation with the county councils, and told "We believe that these are the roads where we should start administering these schemes; these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
are the roads that will bring greater benefit not merely to agriculture but to the families of the people who work in these areas," we can spend the whole of the ten years in which this Bill is allotted to run and still have roads which are vital to agriculture left out. It is here, I think that we have the real flaw, at the beginning of this Bill, and unless we can remedy it in Committee, the Bill may be a disappointment where it ought to be a success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an additional important point which I should like to make in connection with hill farming schemes. This Bill has been promoted because of the effect that it will have on hill farming schemes. Up to the end of 1953, there were 433 schemes in Brecon, Cardigan, Merioneth, Montgomery and Radnor for unclassified roads requiring attention. Unless attention is given to the unclassified roads, these schemes for hill farms will be of no use at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, 11 per cent. of these schemes are held up because county councils are not able to assist in these schemes. I think that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary would be well-advised to put this Amendment into the Bill. When a number of schemes are put forward in my own county—102—what are the farmers and other people in that county going to say if the county agricultural committees are not consulted? Whether the Parliamentary knows it or not, for a number of years the county councils and the highway authorities in Brecon, Radnor, Merioneth and other counties have been in close consultation on these matters with the county agricultural executive committees. I think that the Minister ought to put this provision into the Bill purely for the recognition of those counties which have always worked side by side and hand-in-hand in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a very ambiguous reply in connection with the Forestry Commission. The Forestry Commission, no doubt, have schemes in mind. They have an advantage over the county councils because they are usually in the same department. I think that they are in the same building in Aberystwyth. When it comes to taking land from farmers, the Ministry says that it is in close consultation with the Forestry Commission. I am wondering what priority will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
given to the Forestry Commission in that direction. It will have a distinct advantage over the county councils. Its schemes will be cut and dried. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider this matter on Report and accept this Amendment for the sake of the agricultural executive committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Minister will say to us that he wants this Bill to work for the benefit of agriculture? Most of us on this side of the Committee take the view that we have got off to a very bad start. We could have understood the omission of the agricultural executive committees had this been a Bill sponsored by the Ministry of Transport. But this is a Bill sponsored by the agricultural Ministers for the benefit of agriculture. If we do not have any mention in the Bill, when it becomes an Act of Parliament, that the instruments of the agricultural Ministers in the areas are to be consulted about the preparation and promotion of these schemes, we are inviting the local authorities and highway authorities to regard this as another measure to deal with highways as such. It is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole genesis of this Bill is to deal with such roads are are necessary to be improved for the benefit of agriculture. I would go further than some of my hon. Friends and say that not only should the agricultural executive committees be consulted by the authorities for making the schemes, but the authorities should only permit these schemes after having been advised so to do by the agricultural executive committees. I should have thought that the proposal should come first of all from the agricultural executive committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Joint Under-Secretary of State from Scotland will have in mind that the ideas will in fact come from the agricultural executive committees and not from the county councils at all. If that is their intention, why should their intention not be made a little more clear in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I put this further point to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary and to the Joint Under-Secretary of State? When a scheme is sent forward to the Minister by a county council—bearing in mind that the county council may be a county
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
borough which may not have any farmers in its membership at all—the Minister said that he will consult with the agricultural executive committee. But the Minister may feel obliged to reject this scheme after he has consulted the agricultural executive committee, not because the committee does not think that it is a useful scheme, but because it thinks that there are other livestock rearing areas within its area of responsibility which are in more need of a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not the right then to say to the local authority, "You have picked the wrong area in your council area; you should go elsewhere." If the local authority were obliged to consult with the local agricultural executive committee in the first place, before going to the expense of preparing the cost of a scheme in any detail, is it not very likely that the agricultural executive committee would be made well aware of the whole purpose behind this Bill when it becomes an Act of Parliament, and that they would themselves have conducted a kind of survey of the livestock rearing areas within the county? They would have sought to decide in which parts of the county of their area of administration there was a need for an improvement scheme, such as is envisaged here. They would make recommendations to the council accordingly, and the council would come forward with the most desirable scheme first, and not a scheme which happened to occur to an influential member of the county council, who himself lives near a road which he would like to have improved at public expense because of the convenience which it would be to him. I think that there is a real need to consult the agricultural executive committees in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make this further point? We have had a great deal of most useful and helpful work done in the hill farming and livestock rearing areas under the Acts of 1946 and 1951. They have been most useful Acts of Parliament. There can be no doubt about that. The Ministers themselves will readily agree that there are still certain areas in which the farmers have not taken advantage of the Acts to the extent to which the Ministers would desire. This is sometimes so because of the unsuitability of the access roads. Who would know about that? Of course, it would not be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
county council. It would be the agricultural executive committee which would know that farmers and owners in a certain part of its county within the hill farming and livestock rearing areas have not submitted schemes for improvement of their hill land or livestock rearing land because of the bad access roads to that livestock rearing area. The agricultural executive committee would have that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that, in all the circumstances, there can be no doubt in anyone's mind that the agricultural executive committees should come into the consideration of any scheme at a very early stage. According to the Minister's reply this morning, when the Amendment was first moved and spoken to on this side of the Committee, the agricultural executive committee has to come into consideration of a scheme at the last stage, not at the earliest stage, after a scheme has been brought to the Minister and he has sent it back. That seems to me to be a quite unnecessarily roundabout way of doing this business. I am sure that it would seem to anyone with any appreciation of the problem in the rural areas, that before any scheme is submitted to the Minister, the agricultural executive committee—his eyes and ears and advisers in the area—should first of all have had a look at the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Minister to ensure that this Bill is accepted in the country as a Measure for the benefit of this important branch of agriculture, and he can only do that if he makes provision in the Bill for the agricultural executive committees to play their part in consideration of schemes at the earliest possible stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that this debate has been helpful in making it plain that the agricultural executive committees will be fully brought into this picture. It is really more a matter of actual timing and form than any disagreement in general principle. The hon. Members for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) made the point that the hill farming Acts in some areas are not working as well as they might do because of bad access roads. We recognise that, and that is precisely why we have brought this Bill forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having watched the operation of these Acts during the last few years and recognised the great benefits which they have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
brought in many areas, we have observed that in some areas the access is so poor that farmers have not been able to benefit from them. It is because of that, that we have brought this Bill forward, and because we believe that it is generally recognised that there is a special case in these areas and particularly in parts of Wales, that we have felt justified in committing this large sum of public money for local expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have thought that the right way to do it was for my right hon. Friend to make the grant for improving the roads concerned to the necessary standard, and for the highway authority to be responsible for the operation and, indeed, for the future care and maintenance of the roads. I am certain that is the right way to do this. It follows logically from that that if the county council or highway authority is to be responsible for the work and for the future maintenance of the roads, then they should be the proposing authority. It is for that reason that the Bill is drafted in this form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) is correct in saying that the agricultural executive committees can make proposals under various schemes. They can do so under the Livestock Rearing Act. However, in this case we are dealing with highways, and we feel that the right authority to handle the work and to be responsible for future maintenance is the highway authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For that reason we think it would be inappropriate for the A.E.C., which is not a highway authority, to initiate schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not say it should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) specifically suggested that the A.E.C. should be allowed to initiate schemes, and I am explaining why, in our judgment, and within the terms of the Bill, that would be a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly the A.E.C.s will be brought into consultation, and I do not doubt that county councils in those areas are normally in close consultation with the A.E.C.s. Indeed, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins) said
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
that the county councils in Wales are normally in close consultation with them and are well aware of farming problems, and that the farming interest is not neglected by the county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the things that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have said do less than justice to the county councils and to their sense of responsibility for their counties. I think we can rely upon the county councils to take a responsible view of the problem, and, indeed a humane view of the problem—for there are very human problems involved here. I am certain that they will be sensitive to the representations of farmers individually or collectively. County councils are well aware of the problem areas in their counties and of the problems of access roads which could be improved by this Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When they prepare their schemes a good deal of informal consultation will have gone on beforehand with the A.E.Cs., but it is for the county councils to decide, for they are the authorities in this matter. Technical advice certainly will be available to their officers if they require it in the preparation of the schemes. It is for my right hon. Friend, or for the Secretary of State for Scotland, to consider a proposal when it is formally submitted by a county council, and to consult the A.E.C. on the agricultural merits, and to decide whether he can approve the scheme and what rate of grant he will make. It must be for Ministers to decide what the final decision shall be and what the rate of grant shall be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Bill is drafted in the right way to take account of those practical necessities and of the wish of hon. and right hon. Members opposite that A.E.C.s should be brought into the picture and that the agricultural interests should be adequately taken care of and understood. When we operate the Bill their anxieties will be seen to have been unfounded. I hope that in these circumstances the Amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems I find when serving on a Standing Committee considering an agricultural Bill is that hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
other side sit silently. There is a great phalanx of hon. Members opposite representing county constituencies——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and farmers, and from them we are afforded an example of how county councils look after farming interests. We have such an example from the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Pott) of how the farmers here look after farming interests in Wiltshire; the hon. Member and his hon. Friends have not a word to say. We have to do the whole job of consideration, and we do not altogether like to have to do so. Quite a substantial burden is put upon us. It is time that hon. Members opposite addressed their minds to the problem which escapes the assiduous attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has not answered the points my hon. Friends have put. He may have an answer to them, but he has not given it. If he has the answer, let him produce it. Whatever anyone may have said in a speech, we are not by this Amendment amending the Bill to make it say that the county agricultural executive committees shall initiate the schemes. We are not by the Amendment moving to take away from the Minister the power finally to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to think we were. He made those suggestions. They are two Aunt Sallies. He put up the suggestions and answered them at considerable length and with considerable emphasis. Neither of them is up, so neither can be knocked down. He then put up an alternative defence. He reminded me of a man who was accused of murder and who answered that he was not guilty, but that if he was, he was justified in what he did. The Parliamentary Secretary started by saying that we do not have to worry because there will be consultations with the A.E.C.s, and then he went on to say that in some curious way it would be wrong to have the consultation at that point where it could usefully take place and that it was wrong to make such a provision in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not say that the county councils may not have a sense of responsibility, and may not act in a humane way—although what being humane has to do with
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the improvement of roads I cannot discern. We do not say that county councillors are not humane gentlemen. We do not say they will not take a responsible view. The point is that they may take the wrong view. It is possible to be humane, to be sensible, to be acutely conscious of one's fellow citizens' needs, and still to take a wrong view. The Parliamentary Secretary himself believes it is possible because the Government manage it every day of the week; so clearly it is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are trying to do by this Amendment is to provide that there will be some protection of the interests of the people who live, let us say, at and around Devizes in Wiltshire, or Totnes in Devon, so admirably represented on the other side of the Committee by silent Members. We want the people to be protected against, say, the Wiltshire County Council or the Devon County Council, if and when either should make a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying also that the county councils shall be protected, and at any rate given some power to answer the Minister, which means in this case the gentlemen in Whitehall about whom we used to hear so much, who may make a capricious decision against a county council, which may have decided to go ahead with a sensible scheme and may have had informal discussions beforehand. Our Amendment provides a double check. Neither suggestion has the Parliamentary Secretary answered, and neither seems to interest Tory Members in their loyalty to county councils and to the farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let the hon. Gentleman tell us how, by amending the Bill in this way to say that the county councils shall consult the A.E.C.s as to the agricultural merits of a scheme, we should make the Bill more difficult to work; how, by amending the Bill in that way, we depart from what he says is to be the procedure in any case; how, by making it necessary that these bodies shall consult together, we produce a worse result than he hopes to obtain by informal discussions, which either side can ignore if it should be so silly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens? The highway authority says to the A.E.C., "We propose to take advantage of the Bill. We propose to put up a scheme." It says what it has in mind. In many counties the members of the highway authority are members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
of the A.E.C. In any case, the highway authority will ask the A.E.C, "Do you take the same view? Would you like to put any other view before us?" Then somebody from the A.E.C. will get in touch with the county council and they will talk about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can that make the Bill worse? That procedure will not mean more delay than informal talks may involve. Indeed, it may involve less, because what happens in informal consultations is often this, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) said. A member of the county council may be a farmer. There is a choice between two roads. There is informal consultation, and, by one of those extraordinary coincidences that sometimes occur in rural England, the road to the farm of the farmer who is a member of the council is improved before the other road. The other farmers will promptly have something to say about it, so would it not be better to provide for formal consultation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem to me that the Parliamentary Secretary has answered that point at all. Let him do so. If such a provision would make the Bill more difficult to work, let him tell us. I do not see how it possibly could. Let him tell us what the trouble is, if there is any. I am sure there is not. Let hon. Gentlemen opposite get it out of him. Maybe he is shy of telling us. I had experience of his situation before he took it on, but let his hon. Friends get the answer out of him, for if he is shy of us he cannot be shy of them. He has not answered the point that the county councils are entitled to protection, and that it would be a bad thing if the Minister, after a lot of work had been done, were to butt in and turn down a scheme on supposedly agricultural considerations, when the county council had previously been led to believe it was the supreme arbiter, and so had had no consultations beforehand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that a script has reached the Parliamentary Secretary from the mysterious channels that operate behind us. It may be that now he has something more to tell us. I feel bound to say to my hon. Friends that we cannot allow this matter to pass if there is no better answer than that which we have had. It adds up to this, that the Bill is drafted in this way, and has been drafted in this way by the draftsmen, and we, free Members of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
sovereign Parliament, cannot alter it. That is not a substantial answer to our case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are always delighted to have the Parliamentary Secretary with us, either alone or with the Minister, but there are times when I feel that we could do better if we had the Minister with us. I know the Parliamentary Secretary's difficulty. I think he agrees with us in his heart. I can see it in his eyes. Yet he hesitates to do anything about it. That is because he has had certain instructions, given to him in advance of the debate. What happens in these cases is this. One gets instructions at a briefing meeting the day before the debate, and then, when the debate takes place, no matter how reasonable a case may be, and no matter how much one would like to meet it, one hesitates because inscribed on the top of a piece of paper lying before one are the words, "This Amendment should be resisted."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely difficult for the hon. Gentleman, because in a moment—at least, so we hope—the Minister will arrive, and if the Parliamentary Secretary should have given way to us on his own initiative then there will be an unholy row at another briefing meeting in the afternoon. If the Parliamentary Secretary would like an adjournment until his right hon. Friend can come, or until he can have another briefing meeting, before we come to any decision about the Amendment, I should be willing to move an adjournment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge upon hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that it is not good enough in these circumstances to refuse an Amendment to secure that something shall be done, which the Parliamentary Secretary himself sees ought to be done. Clearly, it should be done. Every farmer here knows it should and could be done. I see that the hon. Member for Devizes shakes his head. He does not know that it should and could be done. I should be delighted if he would tell us why it could not be done. Apart from the hon. Member for Devizes, everyone who has been associated with farming knows that it should be done, and everyone associated with county councils would like to see it done so as to be protected against the gentleman from Whitehall rejecting

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
schemes after a lot of time has been spent on them. I do not feel inclined to let this Amendment go without some protest, and it does not look as if my hon. Friends feel enthusiastic about it going without taking some action. If the Joint Parliamentary Secretary wants to make progress</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a road shall then be declared a classified road."</p></blockquote>
If the right hon. Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) agrees, I suggest we take them together, and if two Divisions are called the Committee can divide separately on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here again I am bound to speak with some personal experience of the work of a county council. If the responsibility for maintaining a road after it has been improved falls upon the county ratepayers, there is less likelihood of the county council initiating such a scheme. After all, the reason why some of these unclassified roads have not been improved in the past is that the cost of improving them would fall upon a locality with a low rateable value so that that expenditure would be a burden too heavy to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the position, the roads which are likely to be brought within the scheme may not carry a great deal of traffic, but are in areas where the ordinary weather, like the rains of the autumn, the frosts of the winter and the melting snows of the spring will cause them to
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
with his Bill he ought to be more forthcoming at this stage. Is there to be no reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, That those words be there inserted.</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes 11, Noes 17.</p>
	<p>deteriorate quite rapidly so that the local authority is only at the beginning of the problem when a scheme of improvement is initiated.</p>
	<p>If the amount of money that was to be spent on these roads per mile was in the nature of £20,000 instead of £2,000, which was the estimate given by the Minister and, I believe, the Parliamentary Secretary, then we would expect them to be in a condition where they would not only withstand the ordinary wear and tear of traffic, but would stand up against abnormal weather conditions.</p>
	<p>But the spending of £2,000 or £3,000 per mile of road will not result in sufficient work to the foundations in channelling, in taking the water off and in meeting the possibilities of severe frosts. It may very well be that despite the amount of work that is done, the road will be drastically torn and may for stretches even be destroyed by rushing water or by some other abnormal circumstances or by something that is continually taking place.</p>
	<p>What will loom very large in the minds of the county council is not just the cost of the initial improvement of the road, but what it will cost per annum when it has been improved. So we find that at the very beginning a very vital consideration enters into the mind of the county council. If the county ratepayers are to be saddled with the whole cost of maintenance in the future and have to take into consideration all sorts of eventualities, then it may very well say that,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
however much a road would benefit agriculture and the neighbourhood, and however much the farmers in a particular area push for an improvement scheme, the cost and the burden that would be placed upon the ratepayer would be so great as to prevent the initiation of a scheme.</p>
	<p>Here the arguments used during the discussion on our previous Amendment and those on this Amendment dovetail one with the other, and if the county agricultural executive committees were brought into the picture, they might persuade the county council in the interests of the people and of the farmers living in the locality to go forward with a scheme in spite of the fact that it would remain a heavy burden on the ratepayers in the future.</p>
	<p>If the Parliamentary Secretary could not see the wisdom of our arguments in the last Amendment, it may me that his brief does not allow him to see wisdom in this particular Amendment. But we think this is a vital consideration. If the burden is too great, then the highway authority will not be concerned just with the initial improvement. If it becomes an unclassified road, then there will be additional expense for the future. This consideration will not be absent from the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is absent from other minds on the other side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may be absent-minded about the arguments we are addressing to the Committee. The Parliamentary Secretary was asked to give his attention to this point during the Second Reading debate. He will remember that the question of the Fen roads was mentioned, and in that connection he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We had a survey made last month in order to give us an indication of the sort of condition they are in. I think it would be right to say that there is only one important link road, in South-West Norfolk, which is being used for through traffic—the sugar beet traffic—and it is the Duchy Road, and I understand that there is some prospect of it being dealt with. The Ministry of Transport has offered to classify it as a Class II road, so that its future maintenance position will be taken care of."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd June, 1955, Vol. 542, c. 1399.]</p></blockquote>
That is a point which we want brought into the Bill for all the roads which are improved, because we want to see their future maintenance taken care of and shared between the National Exchequer
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
and the county rates. Unless that is done, there is a possibility that roads with a high priority for improvement in the interests of agriculture may be left out of improvement schemes because of the high cost of future maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with roads which are in areas with low rateable value where there is little industry or other rateable value to carry the cost of future maintenance. We must, therefore, have in mind what the Parliamentary Secretary said in regard to a particular road and we want it applied generally so that the county council is not hindered by this problem of a future burden upon the ratepayers. I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking with a full knowledge of the position when he made the statement about the Duchy Road in south-west Norfolk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He knows full well that the Norfolk County Council would not look favourably on maintaining this particular road in the future unless it were a classified road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not ask that every road which is improved should become a Class 2 road. It may be that Class 3 is the right category. We are not the only people concerned in this matter. The County Councils Association says that this is a weakness of the Bill. It failed in its negotiations when the Bill was being drawn up, and it now desires that the Government should look closely into the matter to ensure that every road improvement scheme carried out on an unclassified road brings it up to classification standard, and that unadopted roads are also brought up to classified standard. If they are not brought up to that standard of strength, the annual maintenance charges will be very high. If we bring them up to that standard, the improvements will be of a more permanent character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In road construction it is far better to do the job really well at the beginning and to have lower maintenance charges than to do a small job and have higher maintenance charges. We hope, even though the Minister does not put in an appearance at the Committee—we had an apology that he would be late—in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
order to be able to accept the Amendment, that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has given sufficient consideration to it to be able to say, "Here is another flaw in the Bill which can be remedied."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cledwyn Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendments with which we are concerned go to the heart of the administrative problems of the Bill. It is clear that the Government hope to see many miles of unadopted roads in rural areas adopted by local authorities and unclassified roads become classified, for that is one of the main purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many highway authorities will have the incentive or the means to shoulder the additional responsibility that that involves? What is the cost of keeping a road in repair or of improving it? Figures that I have been given show that the cost of keeping a road, its margins and ditches in good and proper trim is about £60 per mile per annum. Taking it on a 6-year cycle, the maintenance of the surface costs a further £80 per mile per annum. Thus, £140 is needed per mile to keep the roads in reasonably good condition every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That expenditure would only preserve them as they stand, and would not cover widening, removal of dangerous corners, drainage and so on, which are required on the larger proportion of rural unclassified roads. Improvement works to bring these roads up to a reasonable standard, say, with a 15-ft. wide carriageway, which is not unreasonable, would cost, I am told, about £5,000 per mile. That is the financial position with which our highway authorities are confronted under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me summarise the expenditure. For good maintenance, £140 per mile per annum is needed; for major improvements, £5,000 per mile per annum. The expenditure which the average county council in Wales can afford at the present time is about £60 per mile per annum. What troubles me is the limited extent to which the Bill may be able to help local authorities. We have to take a practical view, which is that the Bill will not be of great assistance to local authorities in Wales because the financial resources of these authorities are already fully extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To get a proper picture, the Committee should consider the product of a 1d. rate
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
by the Welsh county councils. It shows that they cannot afford the expenditure which the Bill will involve, if they are to do this job. In his Second Reading speech, the Minister of Agriculture said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I say straight away that we envisage a substantial contribution—something more than 50 per cent., I should think."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd June, 1955; Vol. 542, c. 1324.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman does not know precisely what the standard will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From where are the local authorities to get the other 49 per cent.? I do not think they will be able to find the money. They certainly will not be disposed to add to their existing burdens by taking on unadopted roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister of Transport were more forthcoming with his machinery in bringing unclassified roads up to the classified category, highway authorities might feel more disposed to take advantage of the Bill. It is virtually impossible to get the Ministry of Transport to classify unclassified roads. Let me give one example. From Anglesey an application was made to upgrade three miles of unclassified roads in a rural area to class 3, The Ministry said it would consider it if the highway authority would give particulars of three miles of class 3 road that could be down-graded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A typical Tory approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a member of a highway authority for some years, my experience is that it is virtually impossible to get the Ministry of Transport to take action. We must ask the question, and must expect a reply from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, "What will be the administrative liaison between his Department and the Ministry of Transport in relation to these roads?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And with the agricultural committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there the possibility that as unadopted roads become unclassified and as the burden of the highway authority is increased, the Ministry of Transport will be more ready to classify unclassified roads and therefore make them available for the 50 per cent. grant? The Joint Parliamentary Secretary ought to answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must give some easement to highway authorities. You may tell me, Sir Leonard, that I am out of order if I go
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
too wide on this Amendment, but I feel that the Ministry of Agriculture should have suggested the creation of a new class of road, the class 4 road for agricultural areas, with a grant of perhaps 40 per cent. from the Ministry. It is maintenance that will be difficult. If the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to accept the Amendment, which has been so ably moved by my hon. Friend, perhaps he will look into the matter before the Report stage and present us with a formula which will give us confidence and the knowledge that our highway authorities, having accepted the additional burdens envisaged by the Bill, will have the means to maintain and repair the roads in the years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. W. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can all agree with what the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) said, and with his proposals to assist county councils in Wales who are not so well off financially to take over unadopted roads. The spirit behind the Bill cannot be questioned, but many things must be attended to before it can be put into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Merionethshire we have at least 356 miles of unclassified roads. The product of a 1d. rate is about £500 at the present time. Even now the council finds it impossible to do justice to all the roads in its charge because the finance is not there. Until many miles of unclassified roads are up-graded and become recognised as entitled to grant, many local authorities which the Minister is anxious to assist will not be able to take full advantage of the Bill. I urge the Minister to take notice of what has been so well said by my hon. Friend, who just spoke about certain counties in North Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the county adjoining ours, a 1d. rate produces £2,000 and in another county £3,000. If it is the intention of the Bill to help the poor local authorities—I mean poor financially and not in any other sense—it is necessary to up-grade many miles of unclassified road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of the two Amendments is to try to get some help in the future maintenance of the roads. We welcome the taking over by county councils of unadopted roads, in particular, but I say frankly that the mid-Wales counties will not be very keen to promote schemes because of the heavy expenditure needed for future maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Time and again in the House I have asked about the policy of the Minister of Transport in this matter. We should know from the Minister of Transport whether he is disposed to take over some of these roads afterwards, because if he is not, then there will be no encouragement for county councils to promote schemes for classified or unadopted roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1st April, 1954, 65 miles of unclassified roads were up-graded by the Minister of Transport to Class 3. At the same time, he reduced the Class 3 roads by another 27 miles, so that the net result was an increase of about 38 miles. That is a very bad policy, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have a word with the Minister of Transport about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal reason for the interest of the county councils in this matter is that they are dissatisfied with the amount which they are able to spend on the maintenance of the roads. In July, 1951, the Minister of Transport reduced the grants for unclassified roads by 10 per cent. and it will take a great deal of time to improve these roads in future. It will be very difficult for county councils to find the additional money, for the extra burden on their rates will be heavy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken the trouble to find out the expenditure on unclassified roads in the five mid-Wales counties, and the average is £72 a mile. We should like to reach the standard mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) of £140 a mile, but if we are to have an additional burden of mileage of roads without an increased grant to county councils, we shall be placed in a very difficult situation when an additional mileage of unadopted roads is taken over by the county councils. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will make a statement on this matter. He may say that he is not responsible for it, but there should be some liaison between him and the Minister of Transport so that when the roads have been brought up to a given standard he could say to his right hon. Friend, "Cannot you help the agricultural industry by taking over these roads and up-grading them to class 3?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope we shall hear from hon. Members opposite on the very interesting question of unclassified roads. It is surprising that the Minister has not been here this morning, because he has shown interest in it. The Parliamentary Secretary, too,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
takes an interest in the promotion of roads in rural districts. We can give him this credit: an effort has been made to do something about improving these roads, but what is the use of making roads up to a reasonable standard if local authorities have not the money to maintain them afterwards? No doubt, I shall be told that the Welsh and other counties receive larger equalisation grants, but that reply will not be accepted by those who have to pay additional rates in this connection. I hope that for once this morning we shall hear a sympathetic word from the Parliamentary Secretary, that he will say that we have made out our case and that, while he is not responsible in this matter, he will see the Minister of Transport and try to get him to take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. G. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I venture to take part in the debate because——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone has to take part in it, and hon. Members opposite apparently will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—on second reading I mentioned the financial implications of the Bill for the Scottish counties and we had very little information in that debate from the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. We were not told what the Department expected to achieve under the Bill and we were given no indication of the size of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seven crofting counties are excluded from the Bill because they come under a different arrangement, but the financial problem raised by the Bill affects a large number of counties outside the crofting areas. As I said on Second Reading, there are about ten counties outside the crofting areas where the product of a penny rate is £500 or less, in some cases very substantially less. If the Bill is to achieve anything at all it will place a substantial financial burden on these local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I asked a question about the county of Berwickshire, as an example, where the product of a penny rate is less than £500, and I asked how many miles of road it was expected would be done in that county under the Bill. What will be the cost to the local authority? I worked it out at that time that the cost would be 1d. on the rates for every mile done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
In the main these roads serve very few people—probably a handful of farms in a remote area. To ask ratepayers to accept an increased rate burden of 1s. or 1s. 8d. in the £ in order to do 12 or 20 miles of road is asking a lot, and to ask the county to accept the full maintenance when the road has been made is quite wrong. If the Bill is to be a success, there ought to be consultation between the Department of Agriculture for Scotland and the Ministry of Transport about giving further assistance to local authorities to enable them to bear the cost of this work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the crofting areas we have had to make arrangements whereby the Department of Agriculture bears the full cost of the roads. If that is a good principle in certain areas of Scotland, surely it is also a good principle in other areas in Scotland that the local authority should receive some financial assistance from either the Department of Agriculture or the Ministry of Transport. I should have thought that a representative of the Ministry of Transport would have been here this morning to discuss the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not even the Minister of Agriculture is here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no co-operation at all. If the Minister of Transport is concerned about the roads of Great Britain he should have been here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must be careful not to awaken hon. Members opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government want to make the Bill a success, they must attend to this problem. I am surprised that hon. Members opposite have said nothing about this, because all their constituents will have to meet a heavier rate burden as a consequence of it. Apparently they are content to allow their constituents to bear this very heavy and disproportionate burden which is undertaken for work done in the national interest. If it is in the national interest, surely the nation ought to undertake some of the cost. We ought to hear the views of the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal embodied in the Amendment would place upon the Minister of Transport an obligation to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
make a contribution towards the maintenance costs of these roads, when completed. The Bill proposes that, when improved, these roads—either unadopted roads or unclassified roads—will normally remain unclassified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The piece of road to which the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) referred, the Duchy road in South-West Norfolk, is contemplated for classification as a Class 2 road because it is a thoroughfare carrying more than local traffic. It is because it is more than a local highway that the Minister of Transport is prepared to consider classification. The road carries a good deal of traffic coming from a considerable distance to the sugar beet factory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the reason for making it Class 2, but there is no reason for making it Class 2 without making others Class 3. I understand that the proportion of grant for future maintenance would then be 50 per cent., which is what the Amendment seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Member's point. The Minister of Transport is prepared to consider the Duchy road for classification as Class 2 because of the volume of traffic, which will allow it to come under a higher classification, The roads which we are considering here will normally be of only local significance and will serve a few farms in these remote upland areas. It would, therefore, not be possible for my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport to contemplate classifying them even as Class 3. If the circumstances warrant this classification, I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend would be prepared to consider it, but in normal circumstances these will be roads serving only a few farms in remote rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must therefore resist the request made. I accept the eloquent plea made, in particular, by hon. Members from Wales, that many Welsh counties—and counties in Scotland, too—are limited in their resources and may well find the additional burden of maintenance a serious one. My right hon. Friend has had to use his judgment as to what was the right measure of assistance to give in this difficult problem. We felt that the right measure was a substantial grant, which we are offering, towards the capital cost of improving these roads to a reasonable standard for the traffic which they will
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
have to carry. We felt that this contribution was as much as the Exchequer funds should be asked to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) eloquently made the point that we must think of our constituents. Indeed we must. We must consider them, not only as ratepayers but as taxpayers, and we must consider what is a reasonable amount to ask the general taxpayer to pay for the benefit of very small localities which have this special problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely this is being done not in the interests of a small group of farmers served by the roads but in the national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. If it were not, we should not be justified in committing the sum of £4 million to this purpose. We feel that there is a special case which should be recognised and that this is a necessary adjunct to the general picture of the improvement to these hill farming areas. We feel that it is reasonable to make this contribution towards the capital cost, but that it is then reasonable to expect that county councils will be willing and able to bear the maintenance costs which will fall upon them in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the figures given by the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes), our estimate of the maintenance costs is slightly lower than his. We estimate that they will vary considerably depending upon the area, the difficulties of gradient and of water and of other problems. We think they will vary from about £50 a year to as high as £120 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that his figure of £140 is rather on the high side and would be needed in dealing with only the most difficult areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Per 100 yards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, per mile. We are not contemplating a 15-foot carriageway; we are contemplating a much narrower carriageway for these remote access roads in these remote districts. We think that a carriageway of 8 feet or 9 feet, with passing places, will normally be sufficient for the volume of traffic which they have to carry. That kind of carriageway could be constructed for about £2,000, or perhaps, in difficult cases, up to as much as £2,500 or £3,000 per mile. If we had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
to contemplate a 15-foot carriageway, the cost of construction and maintenance would be very much higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What sort of surface?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A tar sprayed surface in the case of maintenance. That is the technical side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the maintenance charges, it is fair to make the point referred to by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins) that the Exchequer Equalisation Grant comes in to assist counties with a limited rate income, and it makes substantial contributions to those with the most limited rate income, both in assisting them to meet their share of the capital cost which is not met by the grant which we are making, and in contributing towards the maintenance charges. We feel that this is as far as we can go in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say that the arguments which have been put by the Opposition are the arguments which, I think, all Governments expect to meet. Whatever provision is made, they feel naturally that it is not enough and that it ought to go further. There is always an argument for that, but, on the other hand, we are making what I believe to be a very useful provision, and we feel that is sufficient to make a useful start in dealing with this very difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the county councils will come forward with their proposals for improving roads in these difficult areas with the assistance that we are offering to make to them towards the capital cost. In these circumstances, I hope that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite will be satisfied that the provision we have made is a reasonable one, and that their Amendment, having been so fully debated, might be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make two points which my hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) stressed. It was also a point which the Parliamentary Secretary himself stressed. The first was whether the Minister could give an undertaking, in the light of what has been said this morning, on the question of his Department approaching the Minister of Transport with a view to getting him to be a little more forthcoming in classifying unclassified roads. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
sure that he would like to give us a strong reassurance upon that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point arises from a quotation which the hon. Member for Anglesey made from the Official Report, when he raised the question of the proportion of grants to local authorities on roads proposed to be assisted under this Bill. My hon. Friend quoted this sentence from the speech of the Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I say straight away that we envisage a substantial contribution—something more than 50 per cent., I should think."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend suggested that that did not carry us very far, and that 50 per cent. was not very helpful for the kind of authority for which we are pleading. I wonder if the Joint Parliamentary Secretary would go on to explain further what was said by the Minister then, namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will depend, but two-thirds will perhaps come into the picture somewhere; perhaps even more in some cases. We shall have to see."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 22nd June, 1955; Vol, 542, c. 1324.]</p></blockquote>
I think it would help if the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, who surely must have had time by now in conjunction with his superior to consider this very vital question arising from what the Minister said, could tell us whether, in connection with applications made by very poor authorities, these percentage grants might not exceed two-thirds. In our view, the nearer they are to 100 per cent., the less likely is this Bill to become a dead letter in most of the counties which it purports to help. I should like to hear from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary on these two points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not deal with the second point, not because I had overlooked it, but because I felt that it might be more conveniently dealt with on an Amendment to Clause 2 to be taken later. I shall be very willing to deal with that in greater detail then, and I hope that I shall be able to satisfy the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts) when the time comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point—the question of classification—we have had consultations with the Minister of Transport, and his general view is that he is not being ungenerous in his classification of roads in the rural areas—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] We shall certainly proceed with these measures in the closest consultation with him, and where there is a possibility
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
that because of the geography of the road concerned it could have more than a local significance, I am sure that he will take that into account. I would stress again that in the very nature of things these roads will not have more than local traffic on them and, therefore, it will be very unusual that such circumstances could arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has become fairly obvious as we have proceeded that we are very badly represented from the point of view of Government policy. We have had continual references to the burden, on local authorities, but no representative of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government is here. Neither is there a representative from the Ministry of Transport. Where is he? Obviously he is away looking for the Secretary of State for Scotland. Undoubtedly, the Secretary of State for Scotland should have been here because next year the Secretary of State for Scotland will be responsible in Scotland for all the present duties of the Minister of Transport and of the Minister of Housing and Local Government and of the Minister of Agriculture. English Members will realise what we in Scotland will have to contend with. That is all to be rolled up in a Minister whom we seldom see. It may well be that the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will be able to give us some information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeking to do by this Amendment is what we have been seeking to do right from the start. We want these roads improved. The obstacle to improving them and the reason why they are in the state which they are just now is lack of money. There is first the capital cost, and then there is the maintenance cost. The Minister has told us that he realises that the additional burden of maintenance is serious. Surely he recognises that if the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Minister of Transport were here they would be able to tell the Committee that one of the things that concerns local authorities at the present time is the number of unclassified roads in the rural areas. What are we doing about this? The Minister says that he is going to make a substantial capital grant, and that that is the right thing to do. Even with a substantial capital grant—and we will argue about that later because it is still pretty
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
vague—that is going to leave a substantial gap, which is an additional burden on the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If at the present time maintenance is, as he says, a serious burden with this additional maintenance aggravating the problem of unclassified roads and the gap in the capital cost which is not being met, this will be a very serious burden on local authorities. We have to remember that it is the local authority which has to initiate and propose these schemes, and its first concern will be what they will mean to the local rates. If the Minister of Transport were here, we could say, "If only you would do something about the other unclassified roads, we might be able to come to some arrangement." We have not even had the satisfaction from the Minister who has spoken so far of knowing that he even recognises the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my English and Welsh colleagues should be in this difficulty. We may see some solution next year when we have all this wrapped up in one man, and can probably bring pressure to bear on him concerning some particular problem. I remember the progress which we made in past agricultural debates when we had representing the Scottish Department a Joint Under-Secretary, Mr. McNair Snadden, a man who was a farmer. Then we did quite well when we put up a reasonable case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real difficulty of getting anything done under this Bill is the question of the financial burden on the local authorities, and that comes down to the question of unclassified roads. The Minister should realise that unless the Government can face this problem and find an adequate solution, we shall not get improvement of our roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Government begin to take this Bill seriously, we shall not get much progress with the Bill, let alone with the roads. I think it is worthwhile to say to the Committee and to the country outside that here is a Bill intended to do a limited job of importance. All the wisdom in the world does not reside in 55, Whitehall, and wherever it is that the elusive Secretary of State for Scotland hides himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the intention is good, it is not good enough for the Minister to bring a Bill to the Committee and not listen to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
a single word we say, to put up no answers beyond, as he did on the previous Amendment and on this one, the answer, "Of course, we understand that you think something else would be better. We are almighty. We have made up our minds that this is best, and, therefore, you can all go home." If we do not say a word in the debate on the Bill, it is still apparently the intention of the Minister to go on in Committee in the same way as he is going on now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said just now that he hoped we would withdraw the Amendment, because the matter had been well-debated. There cannot be a debate when only one side speaks. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley), whose only visit to the Committee this morning was to come in and vote on a previous Amendment to which he had not listened——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. N. Thornton-Kemsley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman could not have seen me, because I was here before 10.30, attending to earlier proceedings, and I have been here most of the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman attended the earlier proceedings, I should have thought that he would have supported the debate on the Amendment. If I have been wrong in saying that he was not here, I regret it. I am very puzzled, for the hon. Gentleman represents a livestock rearing area, and a county council which will be burdened with maintenance costs, and yet he has not a single word to say. He noted that the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland now intended to speak, but the Joint Under-Secretary of State was not proposing to speak until my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) made his protest. The hon. Gentleman the Member for North Angus and Mearns makes no attempt to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie), who represents an area that will be affected by the Bill. It must matter to him what is to happen to the maintenance costs after the roads are improved. It must matter to his constituents whether or not someone will help them with the maintenance costs. But he has not a word to say. Then
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
there is the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. P. Thomas). Conway shares a large mileage of these roads with Caernarvon, but the hon. Member for Conway has not a single word to say. There is no indication that he is even listening to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to say now—and I could, willingly—that there is no prospect of a Division before one o'clock, then, I have no doubt, hon. Members opposite would all go home. They could have gone home after the last Division so long as they left their telephone numbers with the Whip. I am not joking. This is no way to debate; it is no way to attempt to make improvements in our laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think I have ever over-estimated the capacity of hon. Members opposite, but I think they can make useful contributions from time to time. Even they may be able to suggest a way to improve the Bill. They may think that we on this side of the Committee are mistaken in our proposal, but there has not been a single word from them to show why they think we are. They have not said a word to show that the fight we are making is not in the interests of their constituents. They are relying on the fact that these proceedings receive little publicity in the Press and that, therefore, their constituents will not know that they have sat here solidly dumb for nearly 2½ hours leaving the whole burden of seeking to improve the Bill to Members of the Labour Party, who are doing, in addition to their own duty, the duty of hon. Members opposite as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Minister has escaped from his pressing duties elsewhere we should like him to apply his mind to the debate. I do not want to have to repeat all that has been said, so that he may be acquainted with it, and I trust that he will read in HANSARD what has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. D. Heathcoat Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far the Parliamentary Secretary has stonewalled with a bat as irritating to us as Trevor Bailey's must often be to the people he faces. It has not ever gone out of true. It has been there all the time, but he has shown no sign of appreciation of the fact that sometimes a batsman has to engage in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
little stroke play. If I compared the Minister with Peter May I should be doing one of them an injustice, but I think we could ask the Minister for a little stroke play reminiscent of Peter May's and for a little less of the Parliamentary Secretary's stonewalling. I think that would help us more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is this. After this money is taken up and the job is done on a big scale we are, as my hon. Friends have said, allowing a financial burden to fall on the ratepayers. Roads will have been improved which, as the Parliamentary Secretary has just said, will benefit only a few farmers, but the county council will be left with a largely increased cost of maintenance. The Parliamentary Secretary says that always was so, and that the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) is wrong. My hon. Friend said the cost would be £140 a mile to keep the roads in good repair. The Parliamentary Secretary said that is wrong, and his advice is that the cost is £120. We are not arguing about an odd £20. It is when the sum exceeds £100 that things begin to be serious. I do not know what induces the Parliamentary Secretary to think that the County Surveyor of Anglesey is so certain to be wrong and that the people who sit behind him are so certain to be right. However, even if the amount were £120, the Parliamentary Secretary would still be asking the county council to accept an increased burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had better restate the case, for obviously hon. Gentlemen opposite have not been able to grasp it. If it is right to embark upon road improvements at the rate of some £2,500 or £3,000 per mile and for the ratepayers to pay anything up to half, or, at any rate, some of that, then the whole burden of keeping the roads in repair ought not also to be put upon the ratepayers. Some of that cost should be borne by the Government. We have no great proprietory interest in our Amendment, and if there is a better way of drafting the proposal that we have made, let it be taken. We have simply done our best to produce an Amendment to transfer part of the cost from the ratepayers to the nation. If there is a better way of doing it, let us hear about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to hon. Members opposite that they use the respite of the weekend to consider the effect of the Bill on
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
the ratepayers in their constituencies. As a trade union organiser I say to them that if they would like some advice on how to organise a protest meeting with their Whips, I am very willing to place my services at their disposal during the weekend to enable them as Members of Parliament to do their job without being muzzled by a centrally directed vicious Whips' system. I urge them to examine this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, what will happen in North Angus and Mearns? Let the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns find out how many miles of roads in his constituency will be affected by the Bill and how much it will cost to maintain them afterwards. Will it be £120 or £140 a mile or more? Let him work out what the figure will be and what the burden on the ratepayers in his constituency will be to maintain the roads that are to be improved. We shall be delighted to hear from him on Tuesday the result of his researches. We shall be delighted to know why he thinks it is right that that cost should fall upon the ratepayers of North Angus and Mearns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let the hon. Member for Banff find out what will happen in his constituency. I do not know whether he goes all the way there at the weekend. He used to be a constituent of mine and used to stop half way to Scotland. Let him do some research and find out what the burden will be in his constituency. Let the hon. Member for Conway go to Conway and make some inquiries, and not leave the job of looking after the interests of the ratepayers of Caernarvonshire to my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts). Although my hon. Friend is quite capable of doing it alone, I do not think it is fair to him to leave it all to him, for, after all, the hon. Member for Conway gets paid for the job as well. Let the hon. Member for Totnes find out what the effect in his constituency will be. Let him ask the Chairman of the county agricultural executive committee, Brigadier Acland, and find out from him what he thinks is likely to happen in Devon and how much it will cost the ratepayers. Let him do something to protect the ratepayers in his constituency and show a general consciousness of a duty of a Member of Parliament to try to improve a Bill.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
I turn to the Minister and ask him over the weekend to apply his mind to the case we are putting. We seek to transfer unclassified roads and unadopted roads by these Amendments to the status of classified roads. The Parliamentary Secretary has given little attention to these two Amendments, and how little may be judged by the fact that he dealt with both at once. I know. Sir Leonard, that you suggested they should be debated together, but they are different. I am the first to say that the case for one is much stronger than the case for the other. Anomalies would arise out of making one of the Amendments that would not arise out of making the other. Here I am putting the Parliamentary Secretary's answer for him. I am writing the Amendments and the briefs in answer to them. The Parliamentary Secretary did not put that case. He had not seen it. I ask the Minister to be good enough to take the trouble to see what the arguments are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the difference between an unadopted road which is the subject of an improvement and as a result of its adoption becomes an unclassified road, and a road now unclassified which remains an unclassified road? Would they not both remain as unclassified roads as a result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is part of the case that I hope the hon. Gentleman will spend the weekend thinking about. There are anomalies like that, and if we turn some unadopted roads into classified roads we shall be left with some unclassified roads. I am glad the hon. Gentleman appreciates the probem. What we do not like is the suggestion that the Government have decided and will not change their minds, and we can all pack up and go home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to give the Minister a chance to consider a serious matter, and I hope that by next Tuesday he will have considered the excellent arguments of my hon. Friends. I saw that the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland was about to get up when I rose, and if he will start his speech now he will be able to continue it on Tuesday and, perhaps, give us an answer. We shall be glad to find that elusive "Scarlet Pimpernel."
	<br><blockquote><p>"We seek him here,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We seek him there.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In fact, we seek him everywhere.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Is he "—</p></blockquote>

I was about to use some un-Parliamentary language about that "demned elusive Pimpernel," but I refrain. However, the hon. Gentleman can begin, and he can finish his unfinished symphony next Tuesday, and I hope he will have something better to tell us than we have heard so far from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Niall Macpherson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) twits us for not having taken the Bill seriously, but in parts of his very amusing speech I was wondering to what extent he was considering the Bill seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look at the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He suggests that my hon. Friends are not even listening, but it does not seem to have occurred to him that perhaps my hon. Friends agree with us and do not agree with him and his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did not the hon. Gentleman notice that on Second Reading the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) made an extremely critical speech? Has anything been done in the meantime to cause the hon. Gentleman to change his views?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By no means. My hon. Friend has an opportunity to make another speech, but it may be that he has already been convinced by what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let him say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I may be regarded as speaking without prejudice to anything that may be said further on this subject at the next sitting by the Parliamentary Secretary or my right hon. Friend, but I should like to deal with one or two matters relating to Scotland.

I think we ought to get clearly in our minds on whom it is that the responsibility for the maintenance of unclassified roads now rests. The answer is, of course, that it rests now with the county council, which is the highway authority. We are proposing to enable the county council to improve some of these roads. We are dealing with the livestock rearing areas.

The Opposition go further and say, "Help improve those roads; give a grant towards improving the roads, but then go

	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
on and give something because you have given a grant to improve those roads." If we give a grant to improve the roads in the first place we give very substantial help to the local authority—an unlooked for help—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Yes, an unlooked for help in carrying out a duty already laid upon it. It is extraordinary to ask us to go so very much further and to cut across the whole general principle of the classification of roads. That is not a matter for this Committee. It is not a matter for my right hon. Friend. The Bill deals only
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
with livestock rearing areas. If we are now to say that the roads are to be treated on any principle other than that on which they have been treated and classified in the past, we shall make a major change in the law——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
