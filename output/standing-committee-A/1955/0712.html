	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. D. Heathcoat Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I owe an apology to my colleagues in this Committee for not being present at the beginning of our deliberations and I ask hon. Members opposite to convey my apologies to their colleagues—who I think must all be at Ascot. I owe the Committee another apology, because I am afraid I shall be able to be here for only a short time this morning——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ascot meets in the afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for the reason alleged by hon. Members opposite, but because I have two functions to perform in two different places at the same time. As Minister of Agriculture one tries to learn how to combine stability with flexibility. I am always trying to push the qualities of adaptability to the limits of possibility, but I try also to combine courtesy to this Committee with the performance of my other duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that we have not been able to adopt the Amendments which have been put forward by the Opposition, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary last Thursday. I am particularly sorry, because I know that hon. Members in all parts of the Committee are convinced that the aims of the Bill are sound. We all want to see the improvements put in hand as soon as possible and we all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
realise that it is not an easy problem. We are all equally anxious lest practical difficulties of one kind or another may prevent as rapid progress as we should like. I am sorry, therefore, that we find ourselves unable so far to accept the Amendments which have been proposed, but I hope that as we go along we may find ourselves more in agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise two points in relation to these Amendments. The first is that this Bill is something of an experiment. It breaks new ground. We are proposing to put public money into a quite expensive form of improvement for what is very local benefit. We must make sure that in each case the investment of public money is justified—not necessarily justified in the narrow sense of an immediate economic return, but on the broader grounds of the economic and social welfare of the area concerned, I think it is right that we should proceed in this matter cautiously. That, I feel, is what hon. Members opposite are criticising us for doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I want to emphasise is that, bearing all that in mind, the Government decided to make available a certain sum—in this case £4 million—from central funds for this purpose. It is easy to say that it ought to be more, or that more could usefully be spent. That may prove to be so. We should all like it to be more, but in this vale of woe I think it is always the job of the Government—a rather unenviable role—in the course of allotting the taxpayers' money, to make a selection from a long list of desirable projects and to do their best to make an insufficient amount of money go round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have felt that the limited amount of money which can be allotted in present circumstances to this new type of project can be used most effectively by giving grants towards the cost of improvement of roads. As my hon. Friend pointed out on Thursday, hon. Members opposite are really asking that the whole principle behind the financial contributions made by the Ministry of Transport for the maintenance of roads should be upset. Under this well-recognised and clearly defined procedure the maintenance of unclassified roads is a local responsibility. If what hon. Members opposite are suggesting were to be adopted it would create the most awkward anomalies between such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
roads as would be improved under the Bill and other unclassified roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that in many of the areas we are now considering the Government in fact make a contribution to local expenditure through Exchequer Equalisation Grants. I think that is the best way, because the grant is related to the aggregate burden falling on the local authorities. It would be quite impracticable to turn all these improved roads into classified roads, and I am sure that on reflection right hon. and hon. Members will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where I do sympathise with some of the views which have been expressed is when hon. Members have said that it will be difficult to estimate what the response will be from local authorities until the percentage of grants which are to be made is known. I agree with that view. On Second Reading I said that we wanted to maintain a certain amount of flexibility until we could estimate rather more precisely the likely developments and the kind of schemes which would be put forward. I think that sensible. At the same time, I do not want to create a fog of uncertainty and I am very anxious that during our deliberations in Committee we should give hon. Members all the information we can on how we propose to administer the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discuss the percentage of grants a little later in our deliberations, I think that hon. Members will find that there is really not very much between us. I would also repeat that the quicker sound schemes are put up to us the better we shall be pleased. We do not mind at all how quickly this money is spent. When that is discussed I think it will be found again that there is little difference of sub-stance between us. I hope that in these circumstances hon. Members will not press us on these Amendments because they are really asking us to adopt a principle which would cut at the roots of the whole practice of Government financial assistance to road authorities. I am quite sure that it would be wrong to attempt to do that in this small Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has clearly shown his desire to be courteous to the whole Committee. He has explained the reason he could not be with us all the time on Thursday morning
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
last and has made it clear—we understand his reason—that he cannot be with us throughout the whole sitting this morning. However, he has put us into some difficulty, because in his speech he has not confined himself to the Amendment before the Committee. The Minister has dealt with an Amendment which was disposed of on Thursday morning and also with Amendments which will arise later. If we all proceeded to discuss the Amendment we disposed of last Thursday and Amendments which are to come later in the discussions when we are supposed to be discussing the Amendment in page 2, line 7, you, Sir Leonard, would quickly call us to order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not complaining, Sir Leonard, that you did not call the Minister to order, but I am putting to the Minister the fact that he has placed us in some difficulty. Although he was endeavouring to be courteous, I submit that perhaps he was a little discourteous to some hon. Members who made speeches last Thursday. When we rose last Thursday the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland was replying to their speeches. When the Committee adjourned the Joint Under-Secretary was in the middle of a sentence, but he was not allowed to continue his speech this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Niall Macpherson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene to say that my right hon. Friend asked me whether I would mind, in the circumstances, if he spoke first? I said that I did not mind in the slightest and if you will it, Sir Leonard, I hope to continue the speech I was making on Thursday later in today's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily appreciate that the Minister inquired of the Joint Under-Secretary whether he would mind. In fact, if the Joint Under-Secretary had minded, the Minister could not have spoken because the Joint Under-Secretary had the Floor. The Minister could not then have intervened with a speech, but it will be appreciated that the Joint Under-Secretary was replying to a debate and, in taking his place, the Minister did not reply to that debate, but opened a new discussion altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that he regretted that he could not meet the Opposition in some of the Amendments we have been discussing and that he hopes we shall find
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
ourselves more in agreement as we go on. He said that we must proceed cautiously. He joined with us in saying that the sum available was not enough. I think that his words were, "We should all like the sum available to be more." Obviously he has lost his battle elsewhere and is defending a sum of money which he regards as inadequate for the job ahead of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment proposes to put certain words in the Bill which would provide that any such:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… road shall then be declared a classified road."</p></blockquote>
The Opposition is not wedded to those words. We are not here to advocate that these roads must of course become classified roads under the Ministry of Transport. The Government know what we are after. It is that when one or a number of these roads have been improved it is too much to expect that maintenance should be borne by the local authority concerned. We say that it is not enough to provide a grant for the improvement of a road, but that we must go further and provide a grant for the maintenance of that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had put forward any other Amendment it could not have been called because it would have gone beyond the scope of the Money Resolution. We have provided a peg on which to hang a discussion. We ask the Government to consider making a grant towards the maintenance of these roads. I cannot speak about Tories in England and Wales—perhaps there are none in Wales——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are they are silent ones; they never speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few years ago the Labour Government produced those excellent Acts of Parliament which have rendered this Bill necessary—the Hill Farming Act and the Livestock Rearing Act—which did so much for these areas. We, the architects of that earlier legislation, should at least have our advice listened to when we make recommendations on a Bill of this kind, the Scottish Tories used to tell me about road improvements in the crofting counties, but the crofting counties are not covered by the Bill. They are specifically excluded, because they are already covered by broadly similar arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Scottish Tories, cheered on by the Secretary of State, used to represent to me in the House of Commons that it was not enough for the Government to give a 75 per cent. grant for the improvement of these rural agricultural roads. I replied, "Some of these crofting counties are getting Exchequer Equalisation Grants which pay 75 per cent. of the local rates. Therefore, we not only give 75 per cent. grants in respect of the roads but 75 per cent. of the remaining 25 per cent. Therefore, we give 93¾ per cent., and all that the ratepayers have to find is 6¼ per cent." The Tories then said that even if they were given a 100 per cent. grant towards road improvement, the local authorities would be unable to carry out the task of improvement and in addition maintain the roads after they had been improved. It seems to me that the Scottish Tories at that time were making extravagant declarations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now they are not making any at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, or the Joint Under-Secretary, said that our estimate of £140 per mile for the maintenance of roads is too high and that perhaps it should be £120. I can tell the Joint Under-Secretary that some years ago, when I occupied his present post, the estimate was roughly £120 per mile. Costs have gone up tremendously since then; but why should we start asking whether the cost is £120 or £140? If the cost were low, the burden on the Government, bearing part of the cost, would not be so high. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would not have the same cause to resist making a contribution towards maintenance if the cost were low, but we know that the county councils which will carry through these improvement schemes will be doing it for the benefit of agriculture and not for the benefit of the county as a whole. This work is not done to provide an additional and improved highway in a county. It is not a highway in the ordinary sense to which the Ministry of Transport could be expected to apply the funds which are available to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a roadway which is to be improved for the benefit of agriculture. It should be the responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture and not of the Minister of Transport. We know that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
our Amendment would make it the responsibility of the Minister of Transport, but that is because we had to have an Amendment upon which to hang the discussion. If the Minister agrees that the road is for the benefit of agriculture and not for the benefit of ratepayers generally, he should undertake to have the Clause amended to ensure that, out of the moneys voted to the Ministry of Agriculture, there will be a continuing grant towards the maintenance of these highways. I beg the Minister to bear that thought in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live in one of the larger counties of Scotland—Lanarkshire—which is regarded all over the country as an industrial county but which is in fact one of the biggest agricultural counties in Scotland. It has great tracts of hill land and livestock-rearing land. It would be an impertinence to expect the ratepayers in the industrial parts of Lanarkshire to maintain the service roads in the uplands of South Lanarkshire simply because this hill land happens to adjoin their land. It would be absurd to ask them, as ratepayers, to assume responsibility for those roads as if they were highways in the ordinary sense. They are agricultural roads and the bulk of the money to pay for their improvement and maintenance should come out of the agricultural Vote. I ask the Minister to appreciate these points and to say that he is willing to consider further the Opposition's proposition that the maintenance of the roads should not fall fully upon the local authorities concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) complains that his advice is not heeded. I do not think that he should have any complaints on that score, but I think that he would be the first to be astonished if his advice were always accepted. He has been arguing that when his party was in power we on this side of the Committee were urging him, in respect of the crofting counties, to provide for the maintenance of roads as well as their improvement. But he resisted that plea and he is now urging us to do what he resisted when he was in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to bear in mind the purpose of the Bill, which is to give inducement to county councils to do two things. The first is to improve unclassified roads in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
livestock-rearing areas, which are already the responsibility of county councils, and the second is to improve unadopted roads and to adopt them as unclassified roads. The Opposition argues that county councils will not take advantage of the Bill, because they will not be able to afford to maintain the roads. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) talked about the additional burden on the county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Minister said that—a serious additional burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But when there are local improvements of any kind, there is bound to be an additional burden on the local authorities, where the work is their responsibility. One cannot avoid that, and to say that we shall not get improvements because there will be an additional burden on local authorities thereby is to cut the ground from under the principles of local authority finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. G. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the crofting counties the improvement is borne by the Department of Agriculture and not by the county council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the cost of improvement is borne by the Department to a very large extent, but we are now talking about maintenance and not improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that the argument may apply to some extent to unadopted roads, which are not the responsibility of local authorities, although we think that the grant offered will be at any rate a very considerable inducement——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member knows very well that there is an Amendment on the Notice Paper in his name on that point, and we shall come to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask hon. Members opposite to consider that the improvement of unadopted roads need not cost the local authorities anything at all if they are able to obtain a contribution from those who are at present responsible for the roads. That is a matter for the local authorities. They may decide to meet a part of the cost and negotiate an agreement for the whole of the balance to be borne by those who are responsible at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman stating the position correctly? Is it for the local authority to decide whether and how much other people are to pay, or is it a matter of whether the other people choose to pay? I understand that the local authority will get money out of other people only if other people are willing to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With unadopted roads, it must be a matter for negotiation between the parties concerned. It must be an inducement for local authorities to go on with the work if they feel that they will have a substantial contribution from the parties concerned. I think that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will agree that that is the way in which the arrangement is likely to work with unadopted roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to unclassified roads, the Opposition argues that if roads are improved the cost of maintenance will be increased. If county councils were not fulfilling their responsibility for maintaining unclassified roads that might be true, but the cost of patching up is often very heavy and it may well be that once a road has been made up, the cost of maintaining that road, at any rate within the currency of the Bill, may be such that it would be spent by the local authority anyway if it were maintaining the road in its present condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is the Member for Dumfries. What is the cost to the county coucil of patching up the unclassified roads of Dumfries-shire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member asks a question which is for the county council itself. I doubt very much whether, without considerable research, it would be possible to say what would be the cost of patching up the unclassified roads which are eligible under the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asking what the county council spent last year. If the hon. Gentleman is putting forward his present argument he surely should have inquired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member suggests that I should have inquired from my own constituents. I do not accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have been a good argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing from what happened in certain cases in the crofting counties. It is, in any event, the duty of the local authority to maintain the roads. The Bill does not seek to alter that duty but rather to help the local authority to improve them. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) talked about the rate burden which was involved. He cited the County of Berwick and said that the cost to the ratepayers was 1d. a mile for maintenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is based on figures which were given by the Minister on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have looked into this point. On the basis of eligible roads in that county and the proportion of those eligible roads which we think the county council will ask to have done up, we think that the burden of improvement, at any rate, is not likely to exceed 3d. on the rates even if the county council deals with the whole lot. In that calculation we have taken into account the equalisation grant and the grant provided by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many miles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the benefit that is likely to accrue, we do not think that that is a particularly heavy burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a calculation and has given us the answer, but to make the calculation he must have estimated the number of miles of roads to be treated or eligible to be improved in Berwickshire under the provisions of the Bill. Will the hon. Gentleman give us his estimate of the mileage of roads to be improved and the cost of improving them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the rates represents a certain liability. He chose to make it and you, Sir Leonard, obviously felt he was in order in making it. We asked what that calculation was and on what basis he arrived at it. Surely, we are in order in asking that. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No point of order has previously been put to me. I have ruled no one out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now tell us what the calculation is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Gentleman interrupted me I was on the point of giving those figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he could not give them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that I could not give them. I said that it was very ingenious on the part of the Opposition, because it would enable Hon. Members opposite to deduce a point which we shall come to later. These are the figures. We think that the total amount of eligible mileage in the county of Berwick is 24 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unclassified and unadopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is unclassified and unadopted. I wanted to make this quite clear. We know, of course, the total amount of unclassified roads in Scotland and we know the total in the livestock areas. I am giving this information in deference to hon. Gentlemen opposite who asked for it. We have made the calculation, and we think that about 1,000 miles of unclassified roads might be eligible under the Bill. Applications in respect of that might be made and would qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say quite definitely that no one at present can give a figure for unadopted roads, and that in arriving at our figure we have merely made an estimate which we think is reasonable. We think that the total likely to be arrived at under the Bill for Scotland for both unadopted and unclassified roads will be about 1,400 or 1,500 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cledwyn Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has stated that the total
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
amount is between 1,400 and 1,500 miles. Is that for Scotland alone, or for the whole country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland alone, excluding the crofting counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But what is the 1,450?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first is the unclassified total and the second the unclassified amount plus the unadopted total, which gives the total amount of mileage eligible. It does not, of course, follow that the county councils will want to include all that in their applications for improvements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. G. Gooch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the hon. Gentleman agree that the mileage for unadopted roads is purely guesswork?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we have been asked to justify the figure, and we have gone into this. I wanted to explain that this is the way in which we arrived at our figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still do not understand the 3d. on the rates. What does that mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 3d. on the rates relates to one particular county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. The figures I asked for were of roads to be improved in Berwick, and I must say that it is very difficult to believe that, out of the 1,450 or 1,500 miles in Scotland, there should be only 24 miles in the large hill-farming county of Berwickshire. The hon. Gentleman says there are 24 miles in Berwickshire, and it will probably cost 3d. on the rates. Can he tell us how he has arrived at that figure? What is the estimated cost of improving these 24 miles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

So far we have had only the first figure, and the hon. Gentleman clearly does not know either of the other two figures. He has got his experts with him at the back of the Committee and perhaps he could get the information from them. He might just as well come clean and say, "I guessed the 3d.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I want to make is that our view is that the roads, once made up, are unlikely to require the excessive degree of maintenance which has been mentioned, and certainly not as much as they require in their present condition. Many of these roads at the moment are not being kept in any condition. For that reason, we think that the assistance offered by the Exchequer will prove to be attractive and that the fears of the Opposition are greatly exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say once again, as I said before, and as has been said by my right hon. Friend, that this is an experimental Bill. It gives attractive assistance to local authorities to bring roads up to modern standards. In view of the experimental nature of the Bill we think that it is asking altogether too much to do what has not been done even in the case of the crofting counties—to ask the Government also to assume responsibility for the maintenance of the roads after they have been taken over. For that reason, I recommend the Committee not to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry to tell the Joint Under-Secretary of State that his explanation and that of his right hon. Friend in our view does not discourage us from pressing the Amendment. If we had been told that it was not in the best form to do what we want, that it contained certain anomalies but that the Government saw the point that we were trying to get at and were willing to look at it between now and the next stage, then my hon. Friends might have been willing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
to allow some progress to be made with the Bill at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are not being told that. The Minister says he sympathises with some part of our argument, but he says that the Equalisation Grant can be left to take care of it. With great respect, those of us who have had experience of local government finance know that it does not work out like that. The local authorities do not take over little new burdens and promptly get more from the Equalisation Grant. That Grant is not a bottomless purse into which the Government dip every time a local authority wants more money. It is a very elaborate calculation, and the calculation will not be much disturbed by a thing of this kind. It will merely be a drop in the bucket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Minister is being frank with himself if he thinks that the counties that will be hard pressed on this will recover their money, and be in no worse position, because of the Equalisation Grant. Neither does the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland think so. He chose to stand on a different leg altogether, though for half the time he was on no leg at all. When he did come to earth he got on to a different perch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, in effect, said that the local authorities would be worse off and that this would be a considerable burden to them, but he added, "It is their duty to accept it." These are the words he used, "It is the duty of the local authorities to see that these roads are made up and having got the grant from us"—which he assured us is going to be very generous—"they will be expected to maintain the roads."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seems to think that they should accept that burden, but I cannot see it that way. As the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said the other day, many of these roads will be improved for the use of a few farmers. I am all in favour of that if it means greater agricultural efficiency and the better use of the land, but let us be clear about it. There is no duty on the rest of the ratepayers of a county to bear this additional burden in what was described as the interests of a few farmers. It may be a matter of good business, but it is not the duty of the ratepayers, who are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
entitled to say that since these improvements will affect only a couple or a half dozen farmers they do not feel like taking on that burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To this argument the hon. Gentleman presumably replies. "But it is in the interests of agriculture that it should be done." But is it in the interests of the ratepayers of a county, or of the population of the country as a whole, that agriculture should be developed and expanded at considerable cost? Surely, that is a matter of national policy and not a matter of county policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the right hon. Gentleman is arguing something different. He is saying that it is logical that we should be giving 100 per cent. grants for the improvement of these roads quite apart from any maintenance at all. Is not that what he is arguing on the basis that this is for the improvement of the country generally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will stay with me, I will argue that in a few moments. What I am saying here is that this is a national matter, and quite clearly it is wrong to unload the whole of the maintenance costs on to the county. If the Minister were prepared to indicate that between now and the next stage of the Bill he will look at the matter of the maintenance costs with a view to a proportion being taken off the county, then, of course, we shall feel that we have made sufficient of our point. But at the moment he has chosen to defend the position that not one penny should be taken off their shoulders; not one penny should go on to the nation. We think that that is wholly wrong. It must destroy the arguments on which the Bill is based. It must destroy the arguments which justify giving even the £4 million to begin with; and, whatever the hon. Gentleman said, it is bound to have an effect on the extent to which use is made of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that the Bill was conceived in sin, as I suggested on Second Reading; that its conception had nothing to do with agricultural policy but was due to the need of the Home Secretary to have something to throw to the National Council for Wales the next time he meets them. It may be, therefore, that the Government would be quite
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
content if county councils were deterred from making use of the Bill. The Government might be rather pleased to be able to say, "We offered £4 million in answer to your last report. You have not taken it all up, but that is your business and not ours." The Government would then think that they were in a clean sheet without having spent the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, unpleasant though it may be, the hon. Gentleman's argument makes sense. It does not make sense on any other basis. I did not hear the whole of what the Minister said, but I heard his remarks on this subject, and he put forward no argument whatever. The other argument put forward by the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is that the cost will not amount to as much as we think. He took the extraordinary calculation of the 24 miles of eligible roads in Berwickshire. Leaving aside the fact that he did not have his figures with him, I was not clear what the 3d. was intended to cover. If the 3d. on the rates was intended to cover the annual cost of maintenance after the roads had been improved——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That was the improvement figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we are not discussing improvement on this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This becomes extremely difficult. We have been at it for a long time and Ministers are still answering the case that we are not putting. At some stage, Sir Leonard, we must ask you to accept a Motion to adjourn our proceedings. The Ministers have been reading the wrong brief for the last hour and a quarter today and for the final hour last Thursday. It would be nicer now if the Minister would read us the brief on the present Amendment. We know that he is turning down any Amendment on improvements, but we are dealing now with the question of maintenance costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us try again. Clearly, the 3d. calculation had no relevance to the Amendment, and secondly, the figures were all wrong anyway. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart), who does not have a lot of unadopted and unclassified roads in his constituency, will be able to give the Joint Under-Secretary a lead on this business of calculating, and I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
at some stage of our proceedings he will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that we know the 3d. has no relevance, we can discard that argument. What, then, is left of the hon. Gentleman's careless assertion that no county will have much of a burden placed upon it? I am told that the penny rate in Berwick yields about £500 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twenty-four miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much are we to spend on maintenance? We have a figure somewhere between the unsupported assertion of £120 by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary and the documented assertion of the county surveyor for Anglesey of £140 per mile for maintenance. Twenty-four times £140 is a very considerable sum, somewhere of the order of £3,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is £3,360.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Divided by 500, that represents above a 6d. rate—for 24 miles. I believe that the penny rate in Merionethshire is about £500, but that county has many times more than 24 miles of these roads. If, therefore, on the hon. Gentleman's figures, we assume a 6d. rate for every 24 miles, it is easy for any of my hon. Friends to work out roughly what this means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to see that the Minister has left us. I hope that he will come back. It is very difficult when we are continually being left to debate the Bill with Ministers who have no authority. I enter a most strong protest about the way we are being treated over the Bill. If a county with 24 miles of road is involved in a 6d. rate, for many counties the annual rate for maintenance alone with be 1s., 1s. 6d. or even as much as 2s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the usual silence from the benches opposite, whose occupants are industriously writing. The Minister flits in, makes an irrelevant, unsatisfactory speech and does not even wait for the end of the Amendment on which he has purported to speak. No one else from the other side intervenes at all, and yet we are talking about something that will impose a burden of that order every year upon the counties concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a miserable, wretched, ill-documented answer which is totally unacceptable. I should not be prepared
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
to part with the Amendment in this way. What is more, I do not feel it right that the debate should come to an end now that the Minister has disappeared. Even if he cannot stay and listen to us, he ought to have more arguments addressed to him. When we were in office, we were told many times by Conservatives that our first duty was to the House. Whenever any of us, as happened to me on one occasion, kept an engagement in the Department and our presence was needed in the House, the doctrine was laid down again and again by the present Lord Privy Seal and others that our duty was to the House. That applies equally to the present Minister, and if he will not stay and listen we must put rather more arguments on paper for him to read. Then, perhaps, on Thursday he will come in and indicate that he has done his homework; but if he goes away again, this leapfrogging process will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has been left with instructions to say that he thinks that we have a case, as clearly we have, that he does not like the method proposed in the Bill and that the Minister is prepared to consider with the Secretary of State for Scotland how else the arrangements might be dealt with, I hope that my hon. Friends will keep the debate going for a while and deploy the argument further. I assure the Minister that no progress will be made with the Bill while the Government benches treat us in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise one or two points. The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland gave the figure of 24 miles for Berwick out of a total of 1,500 miles for Scotland. It is obvious from this latter figure that there must be other counties in which the estimate will be between 50 and 100 miles of roads to be dealt with. Some counties will have a lower 1d. rate product, than Berwick. What mileage has to be dealt with in those other counties? All this means that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) has said, a considerable extra sum will be burdened upon the ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the roads that we are discussing do not serve any transport purpose except for half a dozen people or farms. One road goes up into the hills,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
leading, perhaps, to two or three farms. From a national point of view the road is important, but it is not important from the county point of view. The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland must ask himself whether the ratepayers of the county—or the county council, for that matter—will burden themselves with this additional rate burden in order to give a road that the county as a whole does not require, but which is required from the national point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have pointed out before, in the crofting counties these facts are recognised. The original cost of the road has nothing to do with the county but is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture. The road is required essentially for agriculture and, apart from the two or three farmers concerned, the only person interested in the road is the Minister of Agriculture, or the Secretary of State acting as the Minister of Agriculture in Scotland. The county is not concerned. For that matter, when the road was made originally, neither was the Ministry of Transport concerned. That is why our Amendment is possibly wrong and might have to be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to have a different classification altogether which would bring a road under the responsibility of the people who are really concerned with it. How can we in Scotland expect 1,500 miles of roads to be made and maintained by people who do not benefit from them? The figures put forward by the Government Front Bench show that a burden will be imposed upon county councils and ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If 6d. or 1s. is to be put on the rates, what happens? The county council has a meeting and asks why the money is needed. When told that it is for a road up the hillside leading to so-and-so's farm, people will say, "That is nothing to do with us. Why should we shoulder an extra burden for that purpose?" I cannot think the Minister expects to achieve his end in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What puzzles me is that in the crofting counties it is recognised that the interested party is the Department of Agriculture. Why should we suddenly decide that the interest lies somewhere else? I could understand it, perhaps, for England and Wales, but in Scotland this practice has gone on for a great number of years. The Department of Agriculture is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
responsible in the first place for assisting with the roads. Why are we suddenly to depart from that principle?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are we suddenly to change when we come outside the crofting counties? Some of the areas outside those counties are crofting areas. Some of the areas for which the Bill is intended are crofting areas, but, because they do not happen to be among the seven counties listed in the Schedule, they are to be treated differently. What is the reason? I ventured to suggest during Second Reading that as far as Scotland is concerned, we might at least have examined our own experience and acted on it, but the Government are not doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

To return to the Amendment, I wonder whether we can be told what the mileage is in some counties where the product of a penny rate is only £200 or £300. The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland estimated that a very low cost would be entailed in maintaining the roads which were made up. Does he accept the figure given by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of £120 per mile, or has he in mind a lower figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

said, he will see that he was dealing with roads subject to exceptional climatic conditions, such as flooding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to one of my hon. Friends, a figure of £120 was given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. G. R. H. Nugent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think they will vary from about £50 a year to as high as £120 a year."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee A,</i> 7th July 1955; c. 38.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What figure has the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in mind? Is it £100, £50 or what? It is all very well to say that the cost will be low, but that is no guide to us when we come to work it out. We ought to have more information from the Joint Under-Secretary than he has given us. He has given us some figures, but we cannot judge how he gets them. We do not know the cost and we do not know the burden which will be put on some of the smaller counties which have low rateable values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we know is that he has mentioned 1,500 miles of road in Scotland, and one of the largest counties with a considerable area of hill sheep farming will get assistance for only 24 miles, which means that some counties must get a considerable amount more. What is likely to be the burden on the local authorities? That will be the test. Are they likely to bear it when they are not actually interested in the problem, which is one concerning the Department of Agriculture more than anybody else? The Government should have faced the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been told that between 1,000 and 1,500 miles of unclassified and unadopted Scottish roads will be subject to application for grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the Second Reading debate the Minister, speaking in respect of England, Scotland and Wales, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… I think that the mileage will be 2,000 to 3,000 miles in total in the livestock rearing areas—something of that order."</p></blockquote>
If 1,000 or 1,500 miles of the roads are in Scotland and the total estimate for Great Britain is 2,000 to 3,000 miles, notionally Scotland will qualify for about half of the benefits under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Wales the other half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister also said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I surmise that if local authorities come forward with improvement proposals as we hope, about half, or perhaps a little more than half, of the money will be devoted to the Principality."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd June, 1955; Vol. 452, c. 1325-6.]</p></blockquote>
If, as the Joint Under-Secretary of State has said, half is to be devoted to Scottish roads, and if, as the Minister has said, a little more than half is to be devoted to Welsh roads, I should hesitate to give an estimate for the English roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure he would. The Bill is getting into a tangle because it was not properly thought out. The staff work behind it has been hazy and inadequate. The Government have slapped down a notional figure without any attempt to find out what is needed for the purpose. I am inclined to agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) that it would be best to move the Adjournment to enable approximate facts and figures to be placed before the Committee, especially the Welsh facts and figures. The Bill was designed to help Wales more than any other part of the country. I fell deeply disturbed that a Bill which excited a certain amount of hope on the part of Welsh hon. Members should be foundering because the Government have not given it sufficient thought and have not provided the Committee with the necessary information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might give some illuminating figures in respect of expenditure on unclassified roads in Merioneth. In 1954-55 maintenance cost £24,582 and the rate charge was 3s. 4d. For major improvements in the same year the sum was £942 and the rate charge was 2d.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
That makes a total of £24,524 and a rate charge of 3s. 6d. in order to deal exclusively with unclassified roads. These figures give a picture of the situation in counties like Merioneth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gooch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The longer the debate continues the more farcical the Bill becomes. It is evident that the amount of money proposed to be placed at the disposal of local authorities to deal with this immense problem is insignificant and could be absorbed by one or two areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) in saying that the Minister did not address himself to the main question arising from the Amendment. The Amendment deals purely with the maintenance of the roads when they are put in order, and it is the question of maintenance which is disturbing all of us with any experience of dealing with roads under local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that in a matter of this kind the Minister has to proceed cautiously. He certainly is proceeding cautiously. He and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary spent a lot of time in the rural areas in May and I should have thought that they would have appreciated that in one Parliamentary division in which they spent a considerable amount of time—the division which I represent—there were sufficient unclassified and unadopted roads to absorb the £4 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise the Minister for his cautious approach, but I do criticise him for not paving the way to a bigger sum than £4 million. He should have pressed the Cabinet to allow a certain amount of money to be put aside to deal with maintenance costs. It is true that the maintenance of unclassified roads is a local responsibility, and that is why the roads are not taken in hand. Maintenance concerns local authorities more than anything else, and I do not expect a very widespread response from local authorities when the Bill become law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two of my hon. Friends have said that the Bill is exclusively for the benefit of farmers. On Second Reading I expressed the hope that we could deal with unclassified and unadopted roads not merely from the agricultural standpoint and the standpoint of animals in livestock rearing areas but also from the standpoint of human beings. The Bill is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
for the purpose of improving unclassified or unadopted roads situated in, or affording access to, livestock rearing areas, where the proposed improvement is in the interests of agriculture or forestry. The Bill defines livestock rearing areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be hon. Members who regard the Bill merely as a contribution to the efficiency of British farming. I know that we have become very highly mechanised in argriculture, but we have not yet found a machine which feeds cattle. That is where the human element comes in. In all that we do in connection with the Bill we must keep the human problem in front of us. While it is true that the Bill is designed to help production in farming generally, I have always regarded it, so far as it goes within its very limited scope, as making a contribution which we all desire to make towards the improvement of amenities in rural areas. The question is not merely one of placing on local authorities the burden of providing amenities for farmers; it is one of placing an obligation upon local authorities to make a contribution, if it is possible, towards the provision of much needed amenities in the hill farming areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having pressed the point about the contribution which the Bill may make towards the efficiency of British farming, when it comes to looking at it from the human amenity standpoint I would not say that it is not the responsibility of local authorities to make some contribution. If it is looked at merely from the standpoint of providing good roads on which cattle can walk it is an entirely different matter which should be the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not too late for the Minister to obtain more advice and assistance on the Bill. We can make the Bill work only if there is authority from the Ministry of Transport to qualify the provision for making a contribution to local authorities on the vastly important question of maintenance costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that we have not had figures worked out for the Bill such as were given so ably in the House of Commons in relation to Berwickshire. If we could have figures for that county we could have had them for the Welsh counties. The Minister for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
Welsh Affairs was provided with a memorandum in connection with this matter by the Welsh Counties Committee. It would have been easy to work out what the future maintenance of these roads would cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the County of Brecon 50 odd miles of roads come under livestock rearing schemes. On the figures given by the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, I estimate that the additional rate in Breconshire would be 4d. a year. That 4d. a year would be permanent. It would not be merely to tide over after the improvement had come about, but that 4d. would be the figure merely for unclassified roads. There would be an additional burden on the county council for taking over unadopted roads. What would be the burden of an additional 40 miles of unadopted roads taken over by the council? We should have had information in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed about that because I was completely in favour of the Bill. Now that we come to examine it we find that the financial burden on highway authorities makes it not so glamorous as we understood it to be when the Minister for Welsh Affairs addressed meetings of farmers and so on. Imagine what would happen over the 238 miles of unclassified roads in the five counties of mid-Wales. Based on the calculations made by the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland the burden would be terrific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope we can have more information from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture. I am wondering whether he has had a word with the Minister of Transport. I expected the Minister of Transport here this morning to listen to the debate in an advisory capacity. Last week in the House of Commons I asked what was the formula for up-grading unclassified roads and found that it was "through traffic." If that is the formula, there is no hope of the burden being lessened unless some change is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to protest about the figures which have been given us. We find that Breconshire, where the product of the 1d. rate if £1,200, is expected to find an additional rate of 4d. What will the burden be in other counties where the product of a 1d. rate is less? Imagine Cardiganshire, which now pays a very high rate for highways. I know that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
Joint Parliamentary Secretary may say that we should look at the equalisation grant, but councils do not look at the question in that way. With the Exchequer Equalisation Grant a county council cannot go on with great schemes. Does anyone imagine that a county council will look with more favour on a scheme for access roads in rural districts than on schemes for other unclassified roads? They will not do so, because they cannot see benefit coming from maintenance of those roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Parliamentary Secretary should give us more encouragement. The best thing would be for him to say, "We will look at this matter again and see what can be done on Report stage." The arguments have all come from this side of the Committee. I am sure the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) agrees with me, but dare not get up and support the Amendment. He knows the situation better than I do because he is older. He has travelled through Radnorshire, and I am sure he agrees that there is a case for maintenance of these roads. I hope that he will support us if he is allowed to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be as well to remind the Committee of what was the central point in my original argument when I moved the Amendment. Speaking as one with considerable experience of county councils, I said that I did not think that county councils would initiate schemes for improving this class of road unless they could be assured that, having improved a road, they would also have an annual grant towards its maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not yet heard any conclusive argument from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, the Joint Under-Secretary, or the Minister to indicate that they are sure that county councils will put forward schemes. If county councils will not put forward schemes where they are most desirable from an agricultural point of view, clearly the Bill will be a failure. We do not want any more failures in connection with agriculture. We saw a drop in output in agriculture last year. We know that men are leaving the land in large numbers and that farmers are not putting so much capital into their farms as they did in previous years. We are at a very dangerous stage in the development of our agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
One of the matters which might help in this difficult stage would be the improvement of roads quickly in those areas where that is needed. We could then get increased breeding of cattle and sheep and bring a larger supply of store cattle to areas where they are fattened. As I see it, the danger to British agriculture is that there are insufficient numbers of cattle and sheep coming along for fattening. In the Bill we are dealing with livestock production areas and we want to see a rapid development of roads leading to those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have placed this obligation squarely on the shoulders of county councils. What will induce county councils to shoulder this responsibility? We have already been assured by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland that, in one county where the mileage of roads is very low in relation to rateable value, improvement of the roads will cost a 3d rate. Therefore, if in other counties the mileage of roads is much greater in relation to rateable value, the cost will not be 1d. rate for every eight miles, but very much more. Those counties are faced in the first place with a high charge on their local roads for the initial improvement scheme, if they undertake it. Then they are faced with the annual charge for maintenance also falling on local rates, aided, as has been said, by the equalisation grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difficulty those councils have to resolve. It is a question whether in highway committees they will be prepared to commit their ratepayers to these heavy burdens or will say, "No, this is a national problem. This is a problem which the State ought to face. The State ought to shoulder a large share, if not the total, of the cost of improvement of these roads and also give a kind of classification which would assure an annual grant." Why will county councils take that point of view?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a county councillor, I can speak from experience in respect of road problems. This is what we are faced with in one area. The Ministry of Agriculture took the initiative in putting down concrete roads during the war. Those roads have been left, not coming on the charge of the county council, and are rapidly deteriorating. In negotiations between the county council and the Ministry of Transport the attitude adopted was, "We will bring one of those roads, of less than two
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
miles in length, into the category of a Class II road if the county council will take the other 24 miles on an unclassified basis." The county surveyor, making a calculation after inspecting the roads, found that it would cost £45,000 to put them into a state in which they could be taken over before any annual maintenance cost was considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From experience county councils find it very hard bargaining when dealing with the Ministry of Transport to get grants towards these roads. That will dominate their minds when dealing with this question. They will be inclined to say, "The Government have not been forthcoming with regard to adequate grants for initial improvements, or in indicating that they will help us in any way with future maintenance." It was a very amateurish statement on the part of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary when he said that these roads would not cost much in maintenance charges. It did not indicate the slightest experience in meeting the cost of the annual maintenance of this kind of road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the width of road that is in mind is about 8 ft., to meet the needs of people getting to and fro in these districts. I thought that the Minister was in a very cheerful mood this morning and that his early intervention in the debate indicated that he would meet our point of view. He said that we had to consider the economic and social welfare of the district. One item in the social welfare of a district is not a road of merely 8 ft. wide but one through which a bus can pass once or twice a week to pick up people in the neighbourhood and take them to the nearest town to go to the cinema, or to church. That is essential, but transport authorities will not licence vehicles to go along roads which are only 8 ft. wide. No bus proprietor could put in an application for his bus to travel along those improved roads, with a width of 8 feet, because it would not be considered. Therefore if, as the Minister has indicated, he wants to improve the economic and social conditions of the neighbourhood, we must have something better by way of improvement of some of the roads than has been indicated so far. If bus services are operated in these out-of-the-way districts the maintenance costs immediately go up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that farm tractors and heavy lorries that bring requirements to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
farms and take away the cattle are heavy on the roads. I do not think that there is anything much heavier on the roads or anything which more quickly breaks them up than the ordinary cattle float. If hon. Members opposite are not prepared to consider making provision in the Bill for the maintenance costs, the Bill will be largely a dead letter and all our efforts and good intentions will meet with failure. Therefore, the subject of the Amendment is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not basing my argument on any particular classification. It may be that in the interests of the nation as a whole we should have a Class IV or some other classification to deal with roads such as these which are in the national interest. The Joint Under-Secretary has failed completely to meet our arguments and, therefore, we cannot consider withdrawing the Amendment. We must press it and press others so that we can send out to the farming communities in the back districts, far from the advantages of ordinary civilisation, a ray of hope that the roads may be opened up and that the county councils will be able to face cheerfully the problem of doing something about them quickly. Failing any indication of hope from the Government Front Bench, I am sure that my hon. and right hon. Friends must press the Government still further to open their minds and hearts and to loosen the purse strings of the national Exchequer so that the Bill may become in the future something far better than is at present conceived by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been a Member of Parliament for a good many years. For several years after I was elected I was most impressed by the way in which Members of Parliament on both sides of a Committee were able to participate in discussion of the detailed provisions of a Bill and how, following upon the discussion, the Bill was usually amended and, I believe, always improved. That was so for several years after I was elected to Parliament, and for six years I sat as a member of the Government and listened to speeches from both sides of the Committee. I really listened to what was said and, if the weight of the argument was in favour of a certain course, I did not think that all the knowledge and wisdom in the world necessarily resided in my Ministry, and I undertook to consider the arguments.

During the last four years, however, things have changed. Ministers still listen to representations made from our side of the Committee but the arguments are not even answered. The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland gave a list of figures a short while ago and missed the target altogether. We were discussing the maintenance of roads after their improvement, but he conveniently trotted out figures of the cost of improving the roads in the first place. The hon. Gentleman has not applied his mind to our arguments in favour of the Amendment and this morning Government supporters have been busy writing letters to their constituents. No doubt they have been telling them how assiduously they have been looking after their interests in this Committee, but they have not expressed a single word on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing is that we are considering whether, when they have improved the roads, local authorities will be able to meet the burden of maintenance. Do Tory Members think that the local authorities can meet the problem quite easily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do they think at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What did these members say when they were themselves county councillors? Why have the unclassified roads to be improved now? It is because they have not been maintained over the years. It is precisely because the cost of maintenance was too much for the local authorities to bear that the improvement of these roads is necessary now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my hon. and right hon. Friends take the view that the Bill should have been a Bill for the improvement of roads in agricultural areas not for the sake of more efficient farming only but in order to bring amenities and improvements to the farming community. But what do members of the Government Front Bench think?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not think. I am not sure that they can think.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do Ministers think of improving all roads in these areas, or are they merely considering the benefit to agriculture? I think that they are only considering agriculture. The Bill is much too limited in its scope but, with the limitations which have already been imposed on the Bill, we are considering whether the communities within whose areas where the hill-farming roads are to be improved are to meet the continuing cost of maintaining those roads. I say that the local authorities will not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Under-Secretary gave some figures, most of which were irrelevant, to show that in the County of Berwick there are only 24 miles of roadway that could be improved by the provisions of the Bill. That is to make nonsense of the Bill. What kind of roads does the hon. Gentleman think are to be improved by applying these provisions? What about the unclassified roads which run up the valleys in remote areas for many miles, serving only three or four farms? If the roadway is only half a mile long it does not matter, but it is because the roads are usually several miles in length and there is virtually no rateable value in the area and the landowners and farmers are unable to maintain the roads that the Bill becomes necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are in the Joint Under-Secretary's own constituency in Dumfries-shire great estates owned by the Duke of Buccleuch. He is one of the landlords who has maintained these farming roads, but difficulties are now arising because the duke has sold some of the farms as they have become vacant. Another farmer becomes responsible with him for the maintenance of the roads, and frequently, when one has joint responsibility no maintenance work at all is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many miles of these roads are there in Scottish counties where a 1d. rate yields less than £500? The biggest 1d. rate of the lot in the list which I have in my hand is £917 in the case of Angus, which is represented occasionally in this Committee. Banff, which also has its Member of Parliament in this Committee occasionally when a Division is called but who has never any contribution to make to the discussion, has a 1d. rate product of £344 for an area of 399,000 acres. We have already been given a figure of £500 as the product of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
a 1d. rate for Berwickshire, but the figure given in the "Rating Review" is £470.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kincardineshire, with 240,000 acres, has a 1d. rate product of £465. Kirkcudbrightshire produces £532 and if there is one hill farming, livestock-rearing county in Scotland, it is Kirkcudbrightshire. Roxburgh yields £528 whilst Selkirk, a small county right in the heart of the livestock-rearing area in the southern part of Scotland yields £88. Therefore, even on the figure which has been given to us today by the Government, Selkirk will not be able to maintain a mile of road out of the product of a 1d. rate. Wigtown, in the livestock-rearing area in the South-West of Scotland, produces £360. Are these people to maintain 1,450 or 1,500 miles of improved roadway? They cannot do it. And these are the counties which are in the livestock-rearing areas in Scotland, outside the crofting counties. The Clause, of course, does not apply to the crofting counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other counties, such as Lanarkshire where I have always lived and part of which I represent in the House of Commons. Lanarkshire, as I have already said, is regarded as an industrial county but, nevertheless, is one of the biggest farming counties in Scotland. Lanark County Council is a very progressive authority which has improved and maintained unclassified roads. I do not think that any county in Scotland has done better in that respect, but we find that the farmers in the hill-farming and livestock-rearing areas are constantly coming to the county council and asking it to take over this three-mile, this five-mile or this ten-mile stretch of roadway. The county council has been obliged to say, "You bring the road up to our standard, first, and we will take it over." The owners have not been able to do that, and the county council has said that it cannot take the roads over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister think that industrial workers in Central Lanarkshire, who at present pay rates for the maintenance of roads in South Lanarkshire, will dip deeper into their pockets to find the money to improve the private, unadopted roads in South Lanarkshire and maintain them in perpetuity? They will not, unless the Government contribute towards the cost of maintenance. One cannot blame them. Many of my constituents point to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
some of the people who come in to Central Lanarkshire from the agricultural areas. My constituents say that they come in flashy motor cars and they add, "We are not going to improve roads for them." It may be that my constituents see only a tiny minority of these farmers. Many of them do not own flashy motor cars, and many of the farm workers find it difficult to get out of those remote areas. It is an excursion to them to get to Lanark on a Saturday and they have to return home by 6 p.m. otherwise they would not be able to reach home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people count as well and we want to improve the roads for them. But the ratepayers in central Lanarkshire point to the very low rateable value in this part of the world. They refer to agricultural derating, and they call attention to the fact that, if this road is improved and taken over by the local authority and maintained in perpetuity, the cost will not fall on the ratepayers within the area immediately to be served, but on the ratepayers who live elsewhere in the county and who have never seen this part of Lanarkshire in which the improvements are to be carried out. Let us bear these considerations in mind.

We should all wish to improve the roads in these remote areas for the benefit of our fellow citizens who have to live and work there. We want to provide them with additional amenities, to the best of our ability, but if the Government believe that the Bill will benefit agriculture and that it has no wider purpose than that, then it should be the responsibility of the Ministers of this Government concerned with agriculture to find some part of the cost of maintaining those roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I call upon the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) to give the views of his county council upon this matter. I call upon the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Spence) to tell us what the Aberdeenshire County Council thinks about it. I have had many discussions with members of both those county councils, and I know how those bodies in the past argued in favour of the central Government assuming part of the cost of any service which is required for any national purpose.

This is a service required for a national purpose. The Government of which I was a member did not extend grants for the maintenance of those roads in the crofting areas, but there never was a Government in this country that did so much for the rural areas in Scotland as that Government did. We did not say that we had reached the end of the road. We did much good, and if we had continued to be the Government we would have done much more good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Under-Secretary of State cannot get away with failing to do something which is manifestly right because it did not happen to be done by the Labour Government in 1945-50. If he agrees that a case has been made out for a Government contribution towards the maintenance of those roads, he can take it that he will have the support of every Member in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not from those on the other side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they will support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot be sure of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can be sure that hon. Gentlemen on the Government back benches will support the Government in anything they propose to do. If they proposed to withdraw the whole of the Bill they would support the Government as eloquently as they have supported them on the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government can show this morning that they wish the Bill to work in the interests of agriculture, in the interests of those who work in agriculture, and for the benefit of the people who live in those outlying parts of the countryside. If they accede to the request of the Opposition they will show not only that they are concerned about this problem, but that they are ready to consider the arguments that have been advanced both today and on Thursday last. All we ask is that they should undertake to see in what way they can secure a contribution from their own funds for the maintenance of these roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not do that they are saying to local authorities throughout the country, and to Lanarkshire County Council, that they are not willing to help in the improvement of unadopted roads
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
such as those in South Lanarkshire. They are saying to the Dumfriesshire County Council, which is taking over roads no longer maintained by the Duke of Buccleuch, that it will have to take them over and maintain them at the expense of a section of the ratepayers who gain no direct benefit; not at the expense of the general body of people who are benefiting from the improvement and not even at the expense of the central Government, even though this is a national matter connected with a national policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is what the Government are saying to the people of Lanarkshire and Dumfriesshire, then the Bill will have no application in those two counties. We all wish it to be applied not only in Lanarkshire but throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. We do not believe that there are only 24 miles of roads in Berwickshire which could be improved. We cannot quarrel with the figure of 1.400 or 1,500 miles of road in the whole of Scotland, because we have not been given the true picture. I make bold to suggest that the Joint Under-Secretary has not got the true picture, either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has got the wrong picture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill when drafted was not intended to apply to Scotland at all. It was a Welsh Bill which, in due course, was extended to England. Then the Secretary of State for Scotland, who works so assiduously for Scotland that we never see him in the House, decided that the Bill should apply to Scotland. So it has only been during the last week or two that the Department of the Joint Under-Secretary of State has been able to give any consideration to the matter at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wants the Bill to be a success he should take care that too onerous burdens are not put upon the local authorities whose responsibility it is to submit schemes. Even if the Government pay 100 per cent. of the cost of the improvements, it should be appreciated that nothing is being given to a local authority in providing it with an improved road. On the contrary, the Government are imposing upon the local authority the liability to maintain that road, and it is much more important to give a grant in perpetuity towards the maintenance of the roads than in the first place to give a grant for their improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
It is much more important that there should be a grant towards the maintenance of the road, because if that burden is to fall solely upon the rates of any local authority, then, speaking for the local authorities in Scotland, I can say that precious few schemes will be submitted. I make bold to suggest that what applies in Scotland will apply equally in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise chiefly because I am surprised to find that neither of the Junior Ministers present proposes to reply to the very powerful series of arguments that have been advanced from this side of the Committee by hon. Members from England, Scotland and Wales. I notice that hon. Members opposite are busy with pens and paper, no doubt working out eligible roads in preparation for the representation that they will wish to make to Ministers. I see that some of them are addressing envelopes, no doubt to the Chief Whip containing their resignations in view of their dissatisfaction with the neglect which Ministers have shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Owing to the duties imposed upon me by the House as a member of a Select Committee, I was not able to attend the meeting of this Committee last Thursday, but I have studied what was said on that occasion and I have listened to the debate this morning. It seems to me that the principal question to which we have to pay attention is as follows. Whatever a local authority does is partly of benefit to itself and partly of benefit to the Kingdom as a whole. Of course, the extent to which any particular act or service benefits the locality itself or the Kingdom as a whole derives from the nature of that service. That is why we have a system of local government finance which arranges for the share of the cost of the service between the central Government and the locality, but it shares the cost on very different principles and in different proportions for different services, having regard partly to the extent to which the service is one that is mainly local or mainly national, and having regard also to the different resources of the different authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we apply that principle to this case? We are here asking local authorities to take on this liability for the care of certain roads which it is hoped they will improve with the help of grants given to them under the Bill. What sort of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
authorities will do that? As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) so forcibly said in his eloquent speech, the authorities have very limited resources. What is the nature of the service they are required to undertake? It is one where the element of national benefit is much greater than the amount of local benefit; where the proportion of the national benefit is more obvious than it is in a great many services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, if ever there were a case for saying that help ought to be given to a particular locality it is here. That was why it was quite impossible to accept the argument which the Minister put at the beginning of this morning's discussion. He said that if our proposal were accepted, it would upset the whole principle of local government finance in the upkeep of the rates, but I venture to suggest that the essence of local government finance is its flexibility so that we can take account of the limited resources of certain authorities and the peculiar nature of certain services. It seems to me that on a proposal like this it is wrong to argue that something should not be done because it does not conform to a stereotyped conception of what one thinks the financing and the maintenance of roads ought to be like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Amendment do? It suggests, in order to deal with this situation of asking local authorities with limited resources to undertake a service which is at least as much of national benefit as it is of local benefit, that we should treat as a classified road a road which, but for the Amendment, would not be so treated. There is nothing unheard of in that sort of thing. In certain of the Acts relating to housing, for example, a human being is, for certain purposes, regarded as half a human being. In provisions for education, in certain circumstances, a child is counted as two school children for the purpose of making certain financial calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing unheard of in an Amendment suggesting that a road which would not otherwise be regarded as a classified road should be so regarded in order to help certain local authorities. We cannot accept the Ministers over-academic and completely rigid line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the Joint Under-Secretary of State addressed himself to the problem. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
told us that the Minister had said to him, in effect, "I am not going to let you finish your speech. I am going to come in with mine." The Joint Under-Secretary said he did not mind at all. When later on we heard the Joint Under-Secretary, we understood why he did not mind. He endeavoured to resist the Amendment on the basis of certain calculations relating to Berwickshire, which, if we followed him correctly, meant that there were 24 miles of eligible road in that county and we were given a figure of a 3d. rate. The Joint Under-Secretary did not tell us what the 3d. rate would mean, but with the help of my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) we gathered that it meant a sum of about £1,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably the assumption was that the roads would cost about £60 per mile to maintain. That would seem to be correct if we divide £1,500 by 24. At this point, however, the Joint Under-Secretary, in response to an interjection by my right hon. Friend, made the really astounding statement that this was not the cost of maintaining the road if it were improved; it was the cost of improving the road. I wish that he were correct. I wish that the roads could be improved at a cost of about £60 per mile. The Minister earlier had been talking of a cost of £2,000 a mile. We must conclude that the Under-Secretary of State, when he corrected himself, did so wrongly; that he had been right all along and that the cost was not the cost of improving the road, in the sense in which "improving" is used in the Bill, but the cost of maintaining the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At any rate, if the figure was £60 in Berwickshire, it falls between the limits given by the Minister of about £50 in some areas and, perhaps, up to £120—he would not quite concede £140—in others. Let us suppose that the figure does lie somewhere between £50 and £120. Is it not the fact that the authorities in which the cost will run towards the higher figure of something like £120 will also be the authorities with the least rateable value? It will not always be so, but it is a reasonable presumption that that is likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The choice of Berwick, therefore, when we were discussing the difficulties of certain local authorities, was not a happy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
choice. Assuming that the Joint Under-Secretary was in fact talking about maintenance and that his calculations were correct, Berwick would appear to be one of the more fortunate counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the evidence piled up mainly from Wales and mainly from Scotland, and some even, I was happy to see, from England. My own forebears got out of an extremely difficult hill-farming district of Scotland some time ago. From what I hear of the difficulties and the lack of amenities and comforts of human life in those parts, I am happy to say that my family has managed to remain out of them ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of my hon. Friends has made an extremely forceful point. I take it that the purpose of improving these roads is not only a purely agricultural purpose. One of the reasons why it is difficult to get a sufficient proportion of our people to live in countryside districts is that they know that there is going on in the country a fairly sophisticated, highly-developed life in an advanced community and that they are debarred from a great deal of it by the remoteness of the place in which they live. They suffer a constant lack of the sheer physical possibility of enjoying things which to the town dweller are the most ordinary concomitants of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister is being asked to do is to take a very small step towards assisting some of the most hardly placed local authorities to deal with just one aspect of this problem, by consenting to the principle that a number of roads which, but for the Amendment, would not be called classified roads, should be called classified roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister had been able to show that administration would be reduced to chaos if the Amendment was made, that the Treasury would be seriously embarrassed by the resulting expenditure and that the whole purpose of the Bill would be frustrated, we might have felt it reasonable to withdraw the Amendment. The trouble is that the way in which the Minister and the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland have applied themselves to the matter has served only to convince every Member on this side of the Committee—and, I strongly suspect, some hon. Members opposite—that we should do well to press the view that we have expressed in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends that we should give every assistance and courtesy that we can to the Committee, I am very willing to deal with the argument again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is only one argument. It devolves on whether there should be assistance in the cost of maintenance of these roads, when they are improved, beyond that provided by the Exchequer Equalisation Grants. I will not deny that it is a very important point——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly acknowledge, as did my right hon. Friend, and as I did last time, that it is a very important point. We certainly welcome the discussion on it, but I assure hon. and right hon. Members that after very careful consideration, the Government have thought that the right balance was to provide for a substantial contribution towards the cost of improvement and that the maintenance cost should then fall upon the county councils concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly legitimate to take two views about that, and it is reasonable for the Opposition to press their view, but it is altogether unreasonable for the right hon. Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) and his hon. Friends to make polemical speeches and say that we are not treating the Committee with courtesy and not treating the matter seriously because we do not agree with them. These Committees are held to thrash out points on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
which there may be agreement or disagreement. It certainly is no discourtesy or indication of not taking the matter seriously if we do not agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman, using that pretext, went on to say that he proposed to encourage his hon. Friends to prolong the course of the debate and to hold up progress on the Bill for that reason. Is it to be a new philosophy for the Opposition that, whenever they are in disagreement with us in Committee, they will hold up the progress of a Bill? If they do that, they will certainly deny the country the benefit of much valuable legislation now in progress through the House. The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends in taking that view——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not accept the view that Members opposite have put forward. They say that county councils will not make proposals because there is no provision for maintenance. We believe that county councils will make proposals. I felt concerned to hear the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that county councils will put forward proposals and that we have struck the right balance in proposing to provide substantial improvement grants towards the capital cost and saying that although the major justification for the Bill is a national interest—certainly it is; it is the national interest of agriculture in these remote areas—nevertheless, there is still some local responsibility——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —to county councils for the highways concerned. It is simply a matter of balance where the line falls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. and right hon. Members opposite not to be unreasonable about the course of this debate or to impute that we are not taking the matter seriously because we do not agree with them. We come here to thrash out these matters and we cannot agree about everything. To start that philosophy would prevent all progress in Committees. Therefore, I ask that we may now make progress and bring this matter to a conclusion. My right hon. Friend, my hon. Friend and I have put reasons why we feel unable to accept the Amendment, and I hope that in the light of those reasons the Opposition will be prepared to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it customary in Committee to give way? I have attended many Committees concerning agricultural matters during the past ten years and have found that when a Minister makes a statement and a Member rises in his place, the Minister generally gives way. Is it to be the method of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary that his speeches should not be interrupted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that we were making an imputation. Surely, he also made an imputation. He argued that my colleagues this morning were deliberately filibustering or delaying the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) pressed the Minister for a statement. It is the responsibility of the Minister to reply. Many points have been put forward by my colleagues this morning. They have put those points, because hon. Members opposite have had instructions from their Whips to do nothing. Only the other day, hon. Members opposite were rebuked by their own Chief Whip for laughing at the remarks of an hon. Member who dared in his humour to criticise a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the new policy of the Government on important agricultural matters to keep back benchers silent? The hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) smiles. He knows it to be true. The hon. Member for Skipton (Mr. Drayson) also knows it to be true. That is why this morning many of my hon. Friends have raised important matters affecting various localities, matters affecting county councils and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
their financial structure in relation to central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have raised specific examples about Cumberland. Cumberland has had to face great difficulties in the last twelve months. Our grants for the maintenance of classified roads have been reduced. How will the Bill affect Cumberland? The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is not certain how it will affect Scotland or Dumfries-shire, his own area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the action of the Minister of Transport—who should be here this morning; there is a connection between transport and agriculture—Cumberland has had a disappointment. I have had to raise this matter on the Floor of the House by putting down Questions, and I will continue to do so. Over the last twelve months, grants from the central Government for the maintenance of classified roads have been reduced. Therefore, when we consider a Bill of this kind, the whole question of control and the financing of maintenance is of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider schemes for improving hill farms, whether by buildings or by roads, we have to consider the specific agricultural benefits. I accept that that benefit gives a national benefit, but we must remember that local authorities are undergoing a difficult period. The Government, I hope, are considering other wider issues of policy to strengthen local government administration, but if the Bill imposes further burdens on local authorities, like Cumberland, which already has been affected even from the point of view of transport, it is a serious matter. The result is to create an antagonism between those who feel that specific agricultural matters should always be safeguarded as against the interests of the general community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) is something that we must try to avoid, but the Government, by their policy this morning, ignore that and do not provide us with a proper statement from responsible Ministers who have responsibility in these matters. The Minister of Agriculture should have stayed to answer the case put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown), and we should also have had assistance from the Minister of Transport, whose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1955-1956V001P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
Department has a share in the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right and proper that we should press these matters this morning. For that reason, I always resent the attitude of junior Ministers who seek to brush aside criticism and when people put a point of view, such as that put by Welsh and Scottish hon. Members today, make the charge that the Bill is being delayed. I beg hon. Members opposite to treat these matters seriously. When the Labour Party was in power and agricultural matters were discussed, Labour Party back benchers were encouraged to make their contribution. There was no attempt to impose silence upon them, as has been done on the Government side this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot compliment Ministers upon their handling of the Bill, but I compliment the Tory Whip upon the work that he has done this morning. It is a pity, because there are many Government back-bench Members who have a distinctive rural point of view to put forward, and the Committee and the Bill would have benefited from their experience, not only as farmers but as members of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with hon. Members opposite to make their contributions and let us have their views. It is bad for Parliamentary Government that only one point of view should be expressed from the back benches. After all, ours is not government by the Executive. Hon. Members opposite who support the Executive must make their contribution. The fact that hon. Members opposite should be silent represents a sorry state of affairs for British agriculture, especially for our hill farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time that the Minister treated Opposition hon. Members courteously in view of the contributions they have made. My hon. Friends have not been filibustering but pleading vigorously and eloquently for their own areas. They have made valid criticisms of the Bill. If those criticisms are not met, not merely will hon. Members opposite suffer politically, but, what is more serious, our hill farming communities will be deprived of benefits because of the indifference of the Government to the views of members

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. B. Drayson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who said, "We are the masters now" at the Dispatch Box in this House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that the hon. Member for Skipton (Mr. Drayson) has a viewpoint about being the masters now that he wants to develop, and we shall be glad to hear him do so. Perhaps the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will do me the courtesy of appearing to be listening to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be difficult to listen and speak to the Whip at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing much to hear at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would again draw the attention to the hon. Member for Totnes to that. This is the new democracy. If the other side has a point of view, it is described as nothing much to listen to. That is what is the matter, and that is the basis on which the Bill is being conducted. An hon. Friend of mine said that things have gone wrong during the last four years. I repeat what I have previously said, that the previous Minister of Agriculture, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Sir T. Dugdale) never treated Parliament in this way. Things have gone wrong since he was pushed out of his job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Parliamentary Secretary may think it right to come here and announce his view and then expect us to depart, but that is not how Parliament should work. I made no declaration to prevent the passage of the Bill. I said that if junior Ministers are sent here with instructions which do not permit them to answer our arguments or to give us a promise to reconsider them, and the Minister declines to come here, we are bound to maintain the debate so that the Minister can read what he would not come to listen to. There is no other way in which we can bring these matters to the attention of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Parliamentary Secretary answered not one of the arguments put by us. He has not shown that any of the counties can bear the cost. He has not shown that our figures are wrong. He did not even do my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
courtesy of referring to his very competent and lucidly put argument. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to say that he does not accept my hon. Friend's argument, but he has made no reference to it and uttered no word of contradiction. There has been no word to explain the arrogant contempt of Parliament which is now animating the Treasury Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are bound to assume that neither of the Ministers present has been given any responsibility at all. They are in the position of Parliamentary Private Secretaries temporarily elevated to the Front Bench. Consequently, there are only two effective Ministers. One of them, the Secretary of State for Scotland, hides we know not where, although the other day I caught sight of somebody looking extraordinarily like him in a room under this Committee room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend describe the Secretary of State for Scotland as an effective Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He must be effective if his Joint Under-Secretary is not; otherwise Scotland stands not where she did. The Secretary of State never comes here and we do not know where he is. Thus, we are left with only one Minister who is apparently in a position to consider the matter at all, and that is the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Tuesdays and Thursdays are inconvenient to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as they apparently are. I give a firm promise that we will meet his convenience in choosing other days. However, as long as we are here—I say it firmly and plainly—the business of Parliament will be conducted, so far as we can arrange it, in the traditional pattern of Parliamentary procedure. We are not going to take the ediet "This should be resisted" that some official has written on a piece of paper, and have the Minister repeating it like a parrot, and then have no debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite would have done well to have applied their minds to the issue here. Since the days of the great fights to make this place responsible for the people against the Crown, there could never have been such tame acquiescence in the expenditure of public money as we have had from the Government Benches during our last two sittings. We

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
have here a proposition to spend several million pounds of the taxpayers' money and to require ratepayers to undertake considerable burdens, the size of which no one can explain to us. No Government back bencher has said a single word about it. There has been a cynical refusal to do anything but write the constituency letters which are supposed to be written in the Library later on, to read documents or to look outside the room. Some hon. Members opposite did not turn up at all until they thought that there was the possibility of a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Parliamentary Secretary should convey to his right hon. Friend the information that if progress is to be made there must be an approach to the Bill on the part of Government back benchers which makes the proceedings of the Committee intelligent and not farcical. If hon. Gentlemen opposite will take part with us in an attempt to improve the Bill, and if Ministers will come down from Mount Sinai and perhaps concede that Bills can be improved even after they have left their offices and will consider our suggestions, then we can make progress and perhaps get a better Bill in the end. It will always be up to the Minister to claim full credit for it on Third Reading. So long as there is silent obstruction from the Government benches, the burden obviously falls upon us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to allow hon. Members opposite to make their contribution, would my right hon. Friend suggest that we should meet this afternoon and this evening?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that we will meet the convenience of the Minister to enable him to be here. Whether we can get any speech out of the silent phonographs on the Government benches is another matter. I can give no blanket undertaking, but if it would help to meet in the afternoon and evening I would call a meeting of my hon. Friends to see how far we could go.

We have been putting the case for hon. Members opposite. I do not understand the attitude of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley), for this is a matter which concerns his constituency. It is of interest to know what the annual burden will be and what the increase in rates will be. The cynical attitude of, "It does not matter," ill becomes the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I invited the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie) to go to Banff and find out. He has been a little like the Welsh preacher who prayed for rain; he has taken it too seriously. He has not come back, but I meant him to return. The same thing applies to the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. P. Thomas). I asked him to go and have a look, but he has stayed there. Other hon. Members have apparently made no inquiries at all. Yet we are facing burdens on the rates of 6d., 1s., 1s. 6d. or more—nobody knows how much. The hon. Member for Totnes cannot tell his county council how much it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unsatisfactory to part with the Bill in this state. The only figures we have had—I give him credit for it—were those which the Joint Under-Secretary for Scotland tried his hand at, but they turned out to be completely wrong and completely irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave an answer to a specific question put to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question was put in order to obtain the right answer, but the hon. Gentleman gave the wrong answer.
