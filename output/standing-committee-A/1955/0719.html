	<p>Question again proposed, That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Spence) has altered his consequential Amendment, in page 2, line 37, which now reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to which shall be added such further proportion."</p></blockquote>
This is in order and it may be discussed with the Amendment now before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. D. Heathcoat Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since our last meeting we have been giving a good deal of thought to this problem to see if there is any way at all in which we can meet the views of those hon. Gentlemen who propose that we should have in the Bill a minimum percentage of grants. I am afraid that the further consideration that we have given to the matter has confirmed our view that that would be a mistake. I shall give the reasons for that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we can find no single Act of Parliament which provides a precedent for including a minimum percentage rate of grant to a local authority. There are many precedents for the rate to be at the discretion of the Minister, as we are proposing here. There are also precedents for a maximum grant, and for a fixed grant. In our own sphere of agriculture it seems most usual for the rate to be at the discretion of the Minister. In agricultural education, for instance, the rate of grant is at the discretion of the Minister, as it is for land drainage
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
under the Land Drainage Act, 1930. The Agriculture Act, 1947, and the River Boards Act, 1948, also give the Minister that discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, under the Transport Act, 1919, the rate is left to the discretion of the Minister. With smallholdings there is a maximum rate of grant, and a fixed rate under the Hill Farming Act. In no case can we find a minimum rate incorporated in an Act. Therefore, it would be an entirely novel principle were we to do it here. I do not say that that would have been an insuperable difficulty—we should certainly have considered it had there seemed to be a balance of advantage in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that everyone who has spoken in this Committee has agreed that it would be as well to leave the rate flexible. At our last meeting the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) argued that flexibility was desirable and that is really why we believe that it would be dangerous to include a minimum rate. For instance, we might want to assist a scheme put forward by a local authority which, though sound and desirable in itself, would not contain those agricultural benefits which would justify a high rate of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a case might be where a local authority might want to improve a road not only for agricultural but for other reasons—perhaps for the benefit of the tourist industry—to a standard which, for purely agricultural reasons, would be excessive. The cost might be £5,000 per mile and we might feel that, on agricultural grounds, we would not be justified' in contributing more than, say, £1,500 a mile. If a minimum rate were included in the Bill—and I imagine that, to be acceptable to hon. Gentlemen opposite, it would have to be a substantially high rate—we should be precluded from assisting such a scheme. That is an important point. I do not want to keep harping on what I have mentioned several times—that the Bill is really an experiment in a new field—but I am sure that we should be wrong not to give ourselves a bit of room for manoeuvre if we are to meet the various circumstances of the proposals that may be put to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two hon. Gentlemen expressed the view that a statutory minimum rate would be desirable to enable local authorities to know where they stand. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
do not think that there is a great deal of force in that argument. In the cases which I have quoted where the Minister has discretion, local authorities seem to have the confidence to submit schemes and the work goes forward satisfactorily. Secondly, we have made it plain that we shall welcome consultation with the Ministry at any stage in the proceedings. Unfortunately, we were not able to accept hon. Gentlemen's suggestions for formal consultations in the early stages with the agricultural executive committees, but we do welcome consultation with the Ministry at any stage and we shall consult county committees at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is this point. I have already said, and I repeat, that if the work is to go forward we realise the need for substantial grants to local authorities, particularly for the poorer highway authorities, for these improvements. In fact, I would expect applications for eligible schemes submitted by the poorer authorities—such, for instance, as many of the authorities in Wales—to qualify for the maximum rate of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doubts in the minds of hon. Gentlemen opposite come back to the question of whether the £4 million will be adequate, and I should like frankly to say how we have worked out our computations. I shall give only four or five figures. The total mileage of roads that we think might be in need of improvement in this category is about 4,500 miles. If all those roads were to be improved in the way we are providing for here then clearly the £4 million would not be enough. We do not believe that applications will be made for anything like the whole of that total mileage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the matter realistically we believe that local authorities might apply for between 2,000 and 3,000 miles, which is the figure I mentioned in the Second Reading debate. Assuming that the average grant worked out at about 75 per cent.—that is allowing for unclassified and unadopted roads—and assuming, and we have looked into this again, that the average cost worked out at £2,000 per mile, that £4 million would enable us to make our contribution average 75 per cent. for a total mileage of 2,700 miles. That is the kind of estimate we have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
I would add that if our forecasts are too low, and more sound and eligible schemes are suggested than we think likely, we shall not skimp and cut down our grants in order to "make do." If we did that it would have the effect which we do not want; it would simply mean that schemes would not come forward. We shall go ahead and spend the money as fairly as we can. If the money were spent and some sound and eligible schemes still remained to be dealt with, it would be open to the Minister of the day—and as this scheme covers some years I hesitate to prophesy who he then might be—to say to Parliament "This scheme has been a success. We believe there is more good work that can be done under it and we need more money." That would be the kind of result I should expect to see if this experimental scheme were successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two hon. Gentlemen have taken me to ask for mentioning on Second Reading that some schemes put forward might be obviously uneconomic. They appeared to think that I should not have said that, but I think that on consideration they will remember that this is primarily an agricultural scheme. It would be easy to think of some schemes which just could not be justified economically; schemes which, however wide—and we ought to consider this on pretty wide grounds—just could not be done because the cost would be prohibitive for the object that would achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what I have said, I hope that the Committee will accept the assurance that we have pondered deeply on this question, and have tried to find some way of meeting the proposals contained in this Amendment. On reconsideration I hope that the whole of the Committee will see the force of the arguments I have tried to put forward, and will agree in this new venture to leave the Minister discretion as to the precise rate of grant he gives for any scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. R. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that the Minister's reasons for refusing what I regard as a good and logical Amendment have not entirely satisfied me. My right hon. Friend referred several times to the fact that this is an experimental Bill. For that very reason, I think that he should not rely entirely on the line of thought he adopts towards including a statutory minimum. He said that the Minister will use his discretion. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
may be so, but the difficulty is that the Minister has not sufficient money and, despite what he says, I fear that the success of the Bill will lead to a very large number of applications indeed and that, unless there is a minimum as a safeguard, the actual grants may be below the figure he has mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that his intention is that grants should be in the neighbourhood of 75 per cent. or, for certain roads, up to 85 per cent. He has said that it is his intention to adhere to this percentage of grant. If that is so, I cannot see his objection to having a minimum figure as well. It would safeguard his Department from having to discriminate, and water down grants to a lower percentage rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that there might be a partial grant where a road was improved for tourist purposes as well as for agricultural purposes, but I cannot find where that is included in the Bill. The Bill seeks to improve roads to obtain higher agricultural production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will find it possible to include a minimum in the Bill, which in my opinion will make it more workable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much in agreement with the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Spence), which shows how easy it is, if hon. Members opposite apply their minds to it, to get a bi-partisan policy on agricultural roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made a genuine attempt to meet the arguments but has allowed himself to be discouraged by what for the most part are official rather than political arguments. I see no reason at all, on the basis of what he said, why he should deny himself the protection of a stated minimum. If the aim is to spend the comparatively limited sum of money as quickly as possible, provided that the schemes are good, in the hope that that will show the Government of the day, when the money has run out, how useful the job is and how wise it would be to vote more money, then there is much to be said, from the Minister's own point of view, for stiffening himself with a minimum grant below which he cannot go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Treasuries act the same, whatever the Government of the day, and when
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
he is running out of money the Treasury, who have to approve what he is doing all the way through under the wording of the Bill, will almost certainly press him to reduce the rate of grant in order to make the money go further. That is an inevitable reaction. The Minister will be in an impossible position to resist it because nothing in the Bill commits him to spending money at any particular rate. He will be unable to stand up to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, what is more to the point, since he will be immersed in other problems, his officials will be unable to stand up to the Treasury officials on the question of using the money quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if he were obliged to spend money at a certain rate, he could say to the Treasury, "The money runs out this year and I must have some more otherwise the whole purpose of the Bill will be frustrated, and hon. Members on our side of the House will not like that." That is the argument which one uses with one's colleagues and, using such an argument, he would stand a much greater chance of getting an additional £4 million from the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the Bill is to run for seven years and it is equally true, as the right hon. Gentleman with great prescience foresaw, that by that time a Conservative Administration will not be in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the other hand, if, as the Minister hopes and as we hope, the money is spent quite liberally, the £4 million will run out long before the seven years are up. Indeed, if the schemes are put forward at all quickly at a rate of grant of 75 per cent., it is probable that the Minister will have committed his £4 million—not spent it in terms of signing the cheques—after a couple of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, we need in the Bill some reinforcement for the Minister so that he can get more money when he needs it and some reinforcement for the counties, who otherwise will see their rate of grant dropping as the schemes come forward. Although we may be departing from precedent, I see no reason for which we should not insert the minimum. The other Bills about which the Minister spoke were mostly larger Measures involving much larger sums of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
We all know in our hearts that the sum of money in the Bill is totally inadequate; we know that from the beginning. The Minister says there are 4,500 miles of road, which is a larger figure than that he gave on Second Reading, although he still sticks to the other figure he gave then and guesses that between 2,000 and 3,000 miles will be put up for improvement. None of us has any ground on which to make that guess. It is a convenient guess because it produces the figure which the Minister wants, but, beyond that convenience, it has no validity. The Minister has no more knowledge than any of us present of how many miles of road will be submitted for improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it turns out that his guess, while convenient for the purposes of the Committee, is in fact invalid, we start from the certain knowledge that the sum of £4 million is inadequate. If he commits Himself to spend all of it in a very short time, he will leave high and dry other counties, which have not put up their schemes, or counties which have not submitted all their schemes, and he will have to go to the Chancellor to get more money. I do not believe Chancellors work that way, neither this Chancellor nor any other, and I am sure that the pressure will be upon the Minister not to be committed to any rate of grant until he sees how many schemes there are. He said that is what he wanted to do. He said that he would decide the rate of grant when he saw the schemes coming in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he sees the schemes coming in and makes proposals for grants, and when his officials go to the Treasury, the almost inevitable answer will be, "Reduce the rate of grant in the light of the number of schemes and the money left. You must reduce your rate of grant to an average of 40 per cent. or 50 per cent."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's answer strengthen our case rather than the contrary. I understand his position, for I have been in it myself; he has to make the case here otherwise the Chancellor of the Exchequer will say, "You got £4 million out of me by negotiation and then you sold the pass in the Committee." The rest of the Committee have a duty to strengthen the Minister by insisting that
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
he spends the money quickly and to strengthen the counties by making sure that the job is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little frightened about the other argument in which he said that he must be allowed to grant less than a stated minimum in order to have complete flexibility. I am concerned about his reference to the tourist industry. It may be a good thing to improve roads for the purposes of the tourist industry, but the Bill says nothing about that. I am sure that if we had put down an Amendment to improve roads for the purposes of the tourist industry it would have been ruled out of order as not coming within the terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can have made myself clear. I quoted the tourist industry as an example. I had in mind the circumstance where the roads were of benefit to agriculture and their improvement would be of benefit to agriculture but the local authority said, "These roads have other uses and while we are about it we will make them up to a good deal higher standard than would be necessary if the advantage were limited to agriculture." We might reply, "Under the Bill we can help you on the agricultural side, but we cannot help you for the other reasons." In such a case we should want to limit our grant to, say, £1,500 a mile, which might be only 30 to 40 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is different from what the Minister said earlier, and it still worries me a little. I know that this money is inadequate and I also know that the improvement of roads for agriculture or forestry is urgent and important. Because I know that money used for this purpose will do a good job for agriculture, I am reluctant to accept any idea that the Bill will be used to grant money for other purposes—money which other Departments of the Government ought to find. There is everything to be said for keeping every penny of this money for roads which come within the terms of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed improvement is in the interests of agriculture or forestry."</p></blockquote>
If the money is required for another purpose it is up to somebody else to provide it. To provide flexibility in the Bill so that something other than agriculture
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
or forestry may be taken into account is quite wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to help everybody in this matter. We want to make progress with the Bill, to help the Minister, to help agriculture and to help the counties. We therefore considered what to do about the Amendment. If we honestly thought that the money was available and we were likely to get a fairly uniform rate of grant, around 75 to 85 per cent., we should be content to let the matter go and hope for the best. Honestly I do not think that is likely. The Minister spoke of grants of 75 to 85 per cent., and he obviously has in mind that in general that will be the maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that event I am very much afraid that some of the minima will fall very low indeed and that some roads will be very inadequately grant-aided. Although the Minister explained away attractively what he had said about schemes being too uneconomic to be grant-aided, I am afraid that if he is left without strings on him at all that argument will be used very often to cut out schemes simply because his money is running away from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The reluctance of hon. Members to take seriously the whole of the discussion on the Bill has been most marked on this Clause. Here we have an attempt to persuade the Minister to face the responsibilities of the job. Hon. Members opposite have not given us much support, with the exception of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Spence), and the hon. Member for Banff, having voted against his Amendment, has disappeared from the Committee before any further discussion. That is a reflection of the lack of seriousness with which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
Conservative hon. Members view these discussions.</p>
	<p>I should like the Minister to make clear the basis on which he thinks £4 million will be sufficient. As I understood him, although at one stage my attention was distracted, for no good reason that I can see he chooses 3,000 miles as the mileage of roads to be dealt with under schemes. We would like to know something about that. I should have thought that he was assuming, conveniently, that the cost would be something between £2,000 and £3,000 per mile. If the cost is £3,000 he would get £6 million and £4 million would be the two-thirds. If it is £3,000 a mile and there are 3,000 miles, he would get £9 million, of which £4 million would not be half. If the Minister is banking on it being half-way between it seems that he is altogether too optimistic for the purpose of his own argument.</p>
	<p>I should have thought that, on the basis of those figures, the £4 million is totally inadequate for a grant of 75 per cent. or 85 per cent., as a general rule. What the Minister said shows that the 75 per cent. and, even more, the 85 per cent. could be a very exceptional grant only for very exceptional schemes and that, on his figures, the general run of grants would be a great deal less. I hope that the Minister will tell us more about his calculations and how he arrived at them. Why does he think that £4 million will be enough? Will he inform us if he is prepared to consider applying for more when the money has run out? For example, if he found that the rate at which schemes were coming in and the number of schemes his Department thought ought to be grant-aided by 75 per cent. or 85 per cent. in the first year meant that the money would run out in two years, would he be prepared to seek additional money before the question arose of reducing the rate of grants because schemes were coming in too fast?</p>
	<p>The Minister has had his way on the grants, by the support of absentee Members who could not care less. Because there are so many Tory hon. Members who care so little, there is little that we can do to stop it. Having got his way on that, the right hon. Gentleman ought to tell us that he does not intend to reduce the rate of grants simply because the money is not sufficient. If he tells us
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
that, he should go further and say that, even though his figures are quite accidental and in fact bear no relation to what anyone knows about this problem, nevertheless he will use the money at the highest rate of grant which the needs of the schemes dictate and that if the money runs out in two years he will ask for more without waiting.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When giving information about grants, the Joint Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that circulars would be sent to highway authorities. I wonder if he can give an indication of what will be said in those circulars about the date of commencement of payment of grants? That information must be given to highway authorities, and it would be as well if the Committee knew what the date would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like information in connection with subsection (3) of the Clause which deals with instalments. Are we to have the instalment system which applied on the recent Bill dealing with rural water supplies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the Second Reading it was explained to us that the Bill was brought forward on the basis of a Report of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire and that in its conception, it might be called a Welsh Bill. Subsequently, its character was changed to apply its provisions to the whole of England. The Minister was very careful to say on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I surmise that if local authorities come forward with improvement proposals as we hope, about half, or perhaps a little more than half, of the money will be devoted to the Principality."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd June, 1955; Vol. 542, c. 1326.]</p></blockquote>
This morning the Minister reminded us of the policy of a great many Welsh local authorities when he was expanding his argument statistically to prove how far the money would go on the basis of a 75 per cent. grant. Will the right hon. Gentleman assure the Committee that the purpose of the Bill, which primarily was to assist Welsh areas, will be kept in mind to ensure that the pledge given on Second Reading is carried out and
	<br><blockquote><p>"about half, or perhaps a little more than half, of the money will be devoted"</p></blockquote>
to Welsh needs? We have no objection to other parts of the Kingdom sharing this money, little as it is, but that pledge arose from a prior intention of framing a Welsh
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
Bill to meet a particularly urgent Welsh need. Before we part with the Clause Welsh hon. Members should have the assurance that that pledge will be honoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To prove his argument on the Amendment moved by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Spence), the Minister was obliged to argue that a very high rate of grant might be necessary in connection with applications from poor authorities, such as those in Wales. Would the Minister like to say that his tendency would be to grant the higher rate of grant mentioned in these discussions—85 per cent.—to such authorities in Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I should like the Minister to explain a little more about how applications will be administered. I do not know whether that last point comes properly under discussion of the Clause or whether the Minister would like to deal with it later, but throughout the Bill there is the difficulty about how the grants are actually to be administered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. W. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Thursday the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said that what will influence the Department in deciding on the amount of grant will be, first, the value of the road to agriculture. That can be well understood because it is the purpose of the Bill. Secondly, the Department would be influenced by the cost of the improvement and, thirdly—this I noticed particularly—there was the exceptional circumstances of applicants. I wish that the hon. Gentleman had explained that matter a little further. I represent a county which, from a financial point of view, is a poor county. I am satisfied that the Bill has been framed to assist such counties in particular. The concern of such local authorities is that wealthy counties can submit schemes immediately, whereas poor counties are concerned whether there will be enough money left in the till in a spread over of something like seven years. A county like Merioneth cannot submit schemes in the first, second and third year. I should like the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to explain what he meant when he spoke of "exceptional circumstances." If he can satisfy me on that, I shall be a very happy man because, as I said in Second Reading, I want to see the best use made of the Bill for my county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One or two completely new issues have been raised by what has
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
been said in the last hour. I want to know from the Minister whether he proposes to apply a sort of means test in the allocation of these grants. Are we to understand that a county which has not a high rateable value is to get a higher rate of grant than a big county like Aberdeenshire, which has a high rateable value? Is there to be a differential? In other words do we approve the principle of the means test in the administration of these grants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did the hon. Member not vote for his own Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a principle not contained in the Bill, and that is why I was anxious that my Amendment should be accepted. I am concerned to know to what extent grants are to be watered down. The Minister has given an assurance that he expects grants, in the main, to be 75 per cent. or 85 per cent. according to the type of road. He refused to accept a minimum of 66f per cent. Could he say what sort of minimum he has in mind? I am not referring to a road in which the question of tourist traffic is involved. That is a completely new issue entirely outside the scope of the Bill. Where we are dealing with a road which is of benefit to agriculture, what has the Minister in mind as the minimum? I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend would answer that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to deal with the half dozen questions which have been asked. First, the right hon. Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) asked why we fixed the estimate of the mileage of roads between 2,000 and 3,000 miles. I am afraid that I cannot add to what I have already said. On Second Reading I explained that we had no comprehensive survey on which to work, and that we had to work on the best figures available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have worked on two sets of figures. One is a rough estimate of the maximum mileage of roads which could be held to fall into this category and be eligible for improvement: that is, 4,500 miles. Then, we worked out quite separately, again by tests in various counties, the mileage that we thought would be likely to qualify in the form of schemes. We may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
wrong, but the best estimate we can make at the present stage is between 2,000 and 3,000 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked when payment would be made. It can be made in a lump sum on the completion of schemes. In the bigger schemes, however, we have discretion to pay, as, I think, we should, in instalments as each section of a scheme is completed. I was asked whether I had anything to add to what I said on Second Reading as to the proportion that we estimated might fall to Wales. I have nothing more to add on that. We still think that the estimate that we gave then is as good a one as we can make at present. I think I said that one-half or a little more than one-half of the grants would be likely to go to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was the point about non-agricultural roads. I am still not sure whether I have made my meaning clear to him. The type of case in which we visualise that we might make a substantially lower grant—say, 30 or 40 per cent.—might be where the improvement would bring benefit to agriculture but where the local authority wished for other reasons to make up the road to a higher standard than that required solely for the agricultural benefit. There might be several reasons why a local authority wished to do this. In such a case, the proportion would depend on the standard to which the local authority wanted to make up the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the cost was £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 per mile, we might estimate the agricultural benefit at perhaps only one-third of that figure, and so we might then limit our grant to 30 or 40 per cent. In most of the straightforward cases, however, where the benefit was for agriculture only, I should imagine that our grants would be much nearer the maximum which I mentioned. I gave a rough average of 75 per cent. with a maximum of 75 per cent. for unclassified and 85 per cent. for unadopted roads. For purely agriculture schemes, I should not imagine that the percentage of grant would fall much below that, certainly not below the figure of 66 per cent. which my hon. Friend proposed as the minimum. Here again, however, we must have room for manœuvre until we see these schemes coming forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
The last question related to the means of a local authority. Certainly, the burden that a project represents to a county would be one of the factors that we would take into consideration in deciding whether to make the maximum grant. I have mentioned this previously and I mentioned it earlier today as one of the reasons why we would imagine that in the case of many of the Welsh counties, where the burden would be very heavy, we would in fact make the maximum grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister indicate when the Bill will become operative and the date from which grants will be payable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am wrong I will correct myself later, but I assume that as soon as the Bill is on the Statute Book it would be open to local authorities to put schemes to us. We should get on with the matter then as quickly as we could. Payment of grant would depend on the completion of a phase of a scheme. I do not think there will be any unnecessary delay on the administrative side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The date from which grants will be payable is an important matter to local authorities in preparing their estimates. Will grants be paid for the next financial year or can local authorities submit schemes before the next financial year begins?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities can put forward schemes as soon as the Bill is on the Statute Book. On the administrative side, our consideration of schemes and our approval will be given as soon as possible. Presumably, a scheme would be put in hand by a local authority and as soon as a section of the work had been completed and approved by us, grant would then become payable. Therefore, the cash would be paid when the first phase of a scheme had been completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that in practice it is unlikely that any schemes will reach the stage of having work done on them until 1956. But if it should happen—this was the point to which my hon. Friend was addressing himeslf—that any county had been quick off the mark and a scheme came in quickly and was approved, I presume that there would be nothing to stop payment being made in the current financial year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is perfectly clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are glad to have established that. I have seldom seen a Bill where the staff work behind it was so bad. Nobody seems to know what the wretched thing means until we drag it out bit by bit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a new thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every Bill is a new Bill, but normally a certain amount of preparation takes place before a Bill is flung in. This bears out what I said earlier. The fact was that the Lord Privy Seal downstairs was short of something to bring on to the Floor of the House quickly, and this Bill was thrown in with the most inadequate consideration of administrative problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has again entered into competition over figures with his hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. We are unlucky. Every time that the Minister tries a bit of figuring, the hon. Gentleman gets himself into a frightful tangle over figures that are inaccurate, irrelevant and addressed to the wrong Amendment. The Minister has given us figures of 2,000 to 3,000 miles on one occasion and 4,500 miles on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are two quite different things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, they are not. Originally, the Minister said that the total of roads which he thought would qualify was between 2,000 and 3,000 miles. To be exact, he did not in fact say even that. Let me quote what he said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If I could give some idea"—</p></blockquote>
I am sorry to see that the Minister is leaving. I am addressing a point to him. If he would care to stay, I will be as short as I can. After all, it is the Minister's Bill and these are his figures. The right hon. Gentleman said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that the mileage will be 2,000 to 3,000 miles in total in the livestock rearing areas…."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd June, 1955; Vol. 542, c. 1325.]</p></blockquote>
He did not say, "I think that is the proportion of the total that will qualify." Today, the right hon. Gentleman does not say that. He says, "The total is 4,500
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
miles, but I think that only 2,000 to 3,000 miles will qualify." That is altogether different. When we ask how the Minister, having lifted his total to 4,500 miles, which is between a 50 and a 100 per cent. increase, now concludes that only 2,000 to 3,000 miles of road will qualify, he says, honestly, "We do not really know." Now, when I try to get the facts from him, he gaily wants to attend a meeting of his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would cause disaster in the Cabinet, where many important decisions are taken. If the Minister stays with us and gives wrong figures, we can put him right, but if he gives the wrong figures to the Cabinet, the whole economy of the country is likely to collapse. Every attempt which any Minister has made to give us a figure has proved to be not only guesswork, but irrelevant and inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister runs away and leaves us to handle his Bill for him, he should get us right about this. Does his last figure stand? Is it 4,500 miles in total and not 2,000 to 3,000 miles, as he first said? If it is 4,500 miles in total, on what basis has he fixed 2,000 to 3,000 miles as the likely figure to be affected by schemes? If that is guesswork and quite irrelevant, will the Minister at least withdraw it and let us get on to the next stage, knowing that the best guess which anybody has been able to make is that the total mileage involved is 4,500 and the schemes may cover anything up to 4,500 miles?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At £3,000 a mile as the likely cost, the total amount involved will be something between £13 and £14 million, of which £4 million is available by way of grant. Once the Minister gets his figures right in this way, he will see, as the other Conservative Members would have seen had they remained in the Committee, that the total money available will not cover more than one-third of the roads affected, and that any talk of three-quarters and 85 per cent. is "all my eye and Betty Martin."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Amendment arises out of the Amendment which I moved on the first day of our discussion. My hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary was unable then to accept my four Amendments, but my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, in replying to the debate, said that he hoped that it might be possible, after consultation with the draftsman, to include the words "or district" in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of including these words is to enable a district council, if authority is delegated to it by the county council, to collect voluntary contributions for any road the responsibility for which has been conferred upon it. I hope very much that the Minister will find it possible to include these words, for this will be the only occasion in the entire Bill in which district councils are mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on all sides would, I think, agree that district councils have a definite function to perform in helping county councils with their schemes. This might be a particular Scottish problem, but I am sure that in Scotland we will find that the district councils have a most important part to play. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State will indicate that he can accept these words and that he will give the Government's view on the help which the district councils ought to be able to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Niall Macpherson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Spence) has stated the position accurately. The Amendment would empower district councils to enter into agreements with anyone willing to contribute towards the cost of carrying out an improvement to which the Bill applies. My hon. Friend spoke of this power being exercised in cases in which responsibility had been conferred upon the district council. It is important that it should be stated that this power can be exercised only when the county council, under its existing powers in the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947, Section 123, has appointed the district council to act as agent in carrying out the work. Since application for grants would have to be made by the county council, we think that it would normally be appropriate for the county council to be a
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
party to any agreements which might be contemplated under the Clause. In any case where it were thought desirable to delegate to a district council the function of entering into agreements on behalf of the county council—where, for example, the district council was carrying out an improvement as agent—it would then be open to the county council to delegate accordingly under its existing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that purpose could be served even without his Amendment, and I should like to explain why the Clause includes county boroughs and county districts for England and Wales but not district councils for Scotland. I am advised that the existing English provision whereby county councils may delegate road functions to county districts is far more restrictive than the Scottish power of delegation. In England, special provision has to be made to enable the function of the Clause to be exercised by district councils, whereas in Scotland this function can be exercised without any such delegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the districts can now—because in at least one case in Scotland road powers have been conferred upon districts—exercise such power, and we also realise that local authorities may tend to say that there is no provision for this in the Bill, and, therefore, it cannot be done. For that reason we see no objection to accepting my hon. Friend's Amendment so long as it is made clear—and I make it clear now—that we are not conferring any new powers. In these terms, therefore, I have pleasure in accepting the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. G. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he is not satisfied with the wording of the Amendment, will the Joint Under-Secretary put down an appropriate Amendment on Report to make it clear that a district council can do this where powers are already delegated to it by a county council to look after a road?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I am saying is that the powers have first to be delegated by a county council before the powers that would be conferred if we accepted the Amendment can be exercised. It is

	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
not a question of the powers being delegated before the Bill comes in. In some cases powers have been delegated already. By accepting the Amendment, we should not only be conferring powers on those who have already had power delegated to them, but also we should be conferring power in any case in the future. I will certainly look at this matter again, but I am advised that further Amendment would not be required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 25, at the end to add:
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) (	<i>a</i>) Where a council are willing to enter into an agreement under this section and a two-thirds majority (in terms of acreage owned) of the owners of land which would be benefited by the proposed agreement are likewise willing and so inform the council in writing, the council may subject as hereinafter provided thereupon carry out the improvement to which the proposed agreements relates and shall be entitled on completion of the necessary works to recover the expenses incurred by them in so doing summarily as a civil debt from the owners of the land benefiting from the said works;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) before proceeding to carry out any improvement under the foregoing subsection the council shall first serve on every owner of land which in their opinion would benefit from such improvement a notice of their intention to carry out the works and of their provisional apportionment of the cost thereof and in the event of any such owner serving withing one month of the date of such notice written objection to the proposed works or to the provisional apportionment of cost the council shall not proceed with the said works until such objection has been determined either by agreement or by reference to a court of summary jurisdiction.</p></blockquote>
The Joint Parliamentary-Secretary will remember that I raised this point on the Second Reading of the Bill. I do not want to go into details, except to deplore his reactions to what I want to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the Amendment is to ensure that a small minority of benefiting owners should not be in a position to frustrate the carrying out of an improvement. There may be a substantial number of benefiting owners in agreement to pay voluntary contributions, but if there are a few benefiting owners who are unable or unwilling to enter into a voluntary agreement, what is to be done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment suggests that when two-thirds of the benefiting owners are in agreement, the other people concerned must in some way fall in with the agreement which is under consideration. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
should like to know what the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has in mind with regard to these voluntary agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is no new suggestion. I have known of agreements made in connection with cattle grids, and there has been no difficulty. After all, the owners of cattle grids get that benefit. There has, however, been the position recently that if one owner did not agree to pay a contribution towards a cattle grid the grid has not been allowed, or the county council has not felt that it should erect such a grid. I wonder what will be the position under the Bill. Possibly the Joint Parliamentary Secretary can give an explanation which will be of interest to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. G. R. H. Nugent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We gave a good deal of thought to this question whether there should be any form of compulsory levy, either in the manner proposed by the Amendment, or in any other way. There are many complications. I do not imagine from the manner in which the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins) addressed himself to the Amendment that he would wish me to go into a long dissertation on the problems, but I am willing to do so if the Committee wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We gave this question a good deal of thought, and we consulted the Rural Panel of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire as to its views. It advised us most strongly not to make any element of compulsion for contributions from the landowners because it thought that in the majority of cases, at any rate in Wales, landowners and occupiers were so badly off that it would cause disturbance, objections and delays which would defeat the objects which we all have in mind. Therefore, we decided that it would be better to leave the contribution entirely voluntary, as the Bill now proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that we shall consider proposals from county councils for these schemes of road improvement and determine our rate of grant quite independently of whether or not there is any local contribution. It will then be up to the county council to make whatever proposition it may think suitable to the local owners to come in and make a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
I expect that in some cases the local owners will not be able to make a contribution, but I feel sure that there are others where the local owners will be glad to. They may well go to a county council and say, "We would be willing to pay something towards this in order to encourage the county council to support this scheme." We are encouraged by the success of the cattle grid schemes to think that people are not unwilling, when they see a benefit to themselves, to make voluntary contributions. There has been a large number of such cases. I think that in 90 cases there have been voluntary contributions to cattle grid schemes out of a total of 100 or 150. Therefore, it is evident that landowners do not take a narrow view, and where they can see a benefit to themselves they come in and offer voluntary contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that the best way of dealing with this matter is to accept the advice which we have had from the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will feel satisfied with that explanation, and that he will withdraw his Amendment and allow us to make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sidney Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the explanation given by the Minister was hardly sufficient. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary did not say whether a scheme would be approved by the Ministry if an owner involved in a road improvement scheme was in a financial position to make a contribution towards it and refused to do so. He seemed to me, by his explanation, to be passing the buck to the county council involved, asking it to make a decision on whether to submit a scheme in such circumstances as some landowners being willing to make a contribution and others not. If the council decided not to submit a scheme for a road, although it would clearly be a great benefit from an agricultural point of view, it would appear that there would be no improvement scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision, apparently, rests with the county council, which would have no power to levy an improvement value on a person who refused to pay. That seems to me to be unfair on the owners who are willing to make a contribution to a scheme and who are unable to get one. If the general attitude is that it does not matter whether owners who are able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
bear a financial contribution refuse, and that the improvement scheme will be put through in spite of them, with the burden falling upon the community, and those benefiting financially making no contribution to it, it would seem that that will be the generality of improvement schemes, and those who ought to make contributions will not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this is a weakness which may occur as the administration of the Bill progresses, if the Minister is not clear in his intentions with regard to this matter. I do not think that anyone on this side of the Committee desires to be hard on any landowner whose financial circumstances are such that he is not in a position to make a contribution, but once it becomes known that a person is fairly well off and refuses to make a contribution that will obviously be a discouragement to anyone else to do so, and that appears to be one of the weaknesses of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) said, but I am a little confused about what he is trying to get at. I understood the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to say that there was contact between the Ministry and between the Council for Wales, or some such body—I am not sure of the name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some such body—really.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I have the greatest admiration for the Welsh people, but I am not a Welshman. I understand that this body recommended that there should be no compulsion at all in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West appears to want some sort of compulsion, but I do not think that he is at all clear about the sort of compulsion he wants. How are we to assess whether a fanner is capable of paying? What sort of test are we to have of the financial ability of a farmer to pay towards a scheme? It is all very well to use such glib and easy phrases as, "We think it may be unfair," but it would appear to me that we have to be sensible about this kind of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use, on the one hand, saying, "We do not want compulsion which will result in great hardship to certain parties" and, on the other hand, saying,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
"We think that there ought to be compulsion," unless we are willing to bring in some form of means test. I do not know how that can be done. This is a question of common sense and of a practical approach to the matter. It seems to me that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has given serious thought to this problem, and I cannot see that the argument of the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West, is supported by any idea of how what he wants to happen will be enabled to happen. All he said was, "I do not agree with the people in Wales who say that there should be no compulsion but, on the other hand, I do not want any hardship to occur to anyone." In fact he wants the best of both worlds for everyone, as we all do, but he has no constructive proposal as to how it can be obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. G. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have all become very tender hearted about the landowners, and I do not know why. We spend enormous sums of public money to improve the land and it is the landowner who benefits. The Amendment suggests that the landowner or farmer who is in the minority should contribute. It is really not a difficult problem. If the farmer or landowner is hard up—and most of those I see seem to be much more comfortably off than a lot of people in my division—why cannot he be treated in the same way as the man who is charged a certain amount of Income Tax? He goes to the Inland Revenue office and says, "I cannot pay it all at once, but I will pay so much a year." In the same way, the farmer or landowner could pay over four or five years. It is the farmer whose farm is being benefited, or, in the case of the landowner, the farm on his land which is being improved. Why should not he be asked to contribute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. T. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend will agree that this procedure could be modelled on that followed in the Private Streets Works Act. Under that Act houseowners are allowed ten or twelve years in which to pay the road-making charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The procedure is the same—he can pay over a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one wishes to be hard on these people. At the same time, there is no reason why, if their property is being improved and they are to reap the benefits
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
they should not contribute something. The Government are already to contribute up to 75 per cent. of the cost. That is a very considerable amount. I do not think that it is too much to ask these people to contribute something towards the other 25 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is very modest. It says that where a road serves a number of farms and the farmers and landowners agree to contribute, the council can draw up a scheme for contributions. It also says that if the majority agree to contribute, the scheme should become obligatory on the minority. The minority might be the wealthiest of the lot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He might probably be a Tory member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—he might be anything. Why should he escape his responsibilities? If he is exceedingly wealthy, why should he be able to say "The Government will pay 75 per cent., the local authority can pay the rest and I shall do nothing"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reference to cattle grids the Parliamentary Secretary spoke of satisfactory arrangements having been made in 90 out of 150 cases, but that still leaves 60 cases in which there has not been agreement. I do not know of what district in England or England and Wales the Joint Parliamentary Secretary was speaking, nor do I know if there are comparable figures for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will tell us. He is good at figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very moderate request. If someone's property is to benefit he should contribute a small amount. The Bill offers up to 75 per cent. Surely it is not too much to ask him to contribute a little towards the balance. The unfortunate individual on Public Assistance, is supposed to save up for clothing from the special grants. If that is how one section of the community is treated why should we be so tender about another? Such contrasting treatment creates all sorts of bad feeling. I should have thought that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary could have accepted this modest suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press this matter further. We are again left without the Minister. The Parliamentary

	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
Secretary probably again has these wretched words written on the top of his brief. Nevertheless, we can press him and—who knows—the Committee stage may not finish this morning and his right hon. Friend may have a chance to do some more homework. I also hope that the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will get on his feet towards the end of our sitting. He never manages to do that first thing in the morning, because the Minister gets in his way. So far as one can see, the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has no influence on the Minister, but the mere sight of the Joint Under-Secretary rising scares the Minister and he promptly does something. If the hon. Gentleman can arrange to be on his feet when the bell goes the Minister can rule him out of order and take over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not intend to be unkind to the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell). We welcome the fact that, after four meetings he has spoken. Although he confessed that he was confused, nevertheless it was a verbal confusion. Up to now it has been a confusion hidden by silence, but we hope that we shall hear from him again and that he will intervene during the remainder of our meetings. We sympathise with him in that all the absent lobby fodder on the other side was not present to hear him. The hon. Gentleman noticed that the Whip was not here and took advantage of it. Nor, I think, would the hon. Member for Aberdeen, West (Mr. Spence) have been able to speak to his Amendment had the Whip been present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Clause do? As drafted, it enables a council to enter into a voluntary agreement with anybody willing to contribute. The purpose is quite clear. It is not simply that the landlord who is aching to dip his hand into his own pocket to contribute to something of benefit to him should be allowed to do so. There is no need for a Clause for that. He can always send a cheque to the council and say "I insist on paying my share towards the improvements." In point of fact, he is not likely to do that very often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that what the Government have in mind is this. They think that there will be some cases where a council will not want to submit a scheme at all if the whole of the balance remaining
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
after payment of the national grant must come from its own pocket. There will be some schemes where, if the council could get a contribution from the landlord and others affected, it would go forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This method was put forward to enable councils in those cases to say to landlords and other affected people "We do not propose to submit this, but if you like to enter into an arrangement with us to pay something yourselves we shall consider it." That is why the last words are to the effect that councils entering into an agreement may have regard to any contribution offered in connection with the proposal. That is clearly the purpose. It is to bring in some few schemes that a council might otherwise not consider worth doing. I hope that that is clear to the hon. Member for Yarmouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to go one stage further to help the Government carry out their own intention. There may be a scheme by which a number of people are beneficially affected but for which the general help, for county purposes, is so small that the council will not want to pay its 25 per cent.—or whatever it is—of the total cost. It may, therefore, say to those affected, "If you will shell out a bit we would be prepared to consider going forward." [	<i>Interruption</i>.] If the lobby fodder would come inside the bar, and not sit outside, they would be of more benefit to our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of those affected might be willing to shell out their share, but there might be one or two who would not be willing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) so rightly said, the unwilling ones might well be the wealthiest people. They might well be Tory Members of Parliament, or anything else at all—although anything lower than that it is very hard to imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the council then do? A group of people wants the roads improved. The council is prepared to do something, and so is the State. The number of people willing to pay may not be enough to take a reasonable proportion of the cost from the council. The council says, "On those considerations we are not willing to go ahead, but if you will all come in and pay a share it will just make it worth our while and we shall do it." All that the Amendment does—and it seems excellently drawn and most
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
suitable for its purpose—is to say that if two-thirds of those concerned are willing to shell out it shall be possible to compel the one-third to do likewise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the alternative? As the Bill is now drawn the council says, "We are not going to spend all that amount from the rates. If the one-third will not contribute it leaves too much for us to meet." The scheme does not go through and the road is not improved. By the Amendment, the slight compulsion on the minority of non-contributors leads to a scheme wanted by the overwhelming majority. I should have thought that a very reasonable compulsion. We are not compelling everybody. If less than two-thirds are willing to contribute there is no compulsion on anyone. The scheme just does not go through. We simply say that, in the limited case where two-thirds are willing to pay for a scheme which otherwise they probably would not get, a small minority of non co-operators shall not be allowed to hold up the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman still has not said what he would do about the people who are non co-operators because they cannot afford to be. That is the case that has been put up by Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are faced with a choice of evils. If the non-contributors are non-contributing because they cannot pay then they are in the same position as those affected by a street works scheme in a town. No one takes as an excuse the fact that they cannot pay. They have to pay, and arrangements are made by which they pay the smallest instalments over the longest possible period. That is part of the law which must have applied to dozens of roads in Great Yarmouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, the aim of the Bill is to give help, particularly in areas where many of the farmers are not very wealthy. Many of them—especially in Wales—are extremely poor. It is all very well to say that one should deal with this as one would under the Private Streets Works Act, but the case is not the same. The Bill is meant to help the farmers—not to hinder them and put extra costs on them. Of course, those who can afford it should make contributions, but the right hon. Gentleman still has not answered the question, "What is to be done about those who cannot afford it?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What one always does about the poorer person who can prove that he cannot afford to pay; one still takes some contribution from him but does it in the most beneficial way in the smallest instalments over the longest period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is still putting a charge on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the opposite to the object of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, no. This is where the hon. Member, who has only just taken an interest in the Bill, is in trouble. Let us take it stage by stage. The object of the Bill is to improve agricultural efficiency and the efficient use of the land by improving access to these areas. If we achieve that purpose, the farmers who farm that area will be advantaged thereby and, even though they will still be poor as long as there is a Tory Government in power, they will be less poor because the roads have been improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the case where the cost of carrying out the scheme is so extravagantly high for a poor county council that, even with a 75 per cent. grant, the council says, "We cannot afford to take the 25 per cent. out of the county rates without any contributions from the local people." In many cases it is unlikely that the local people will be poor farmers. They may be well-to-do absentee landlords who leave poor farmers behind them to be poor while they live in England in different circumstances. That is an equally possible case. Whenever we argue these cases the widow's mite is always strained; the one person the Tories are always concerned about is the widow with her mite, but there are other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council may say, "We cannot do this all out of county rates. What about a contribution from the farmers?" Let us say that there are four people concerned and that three of them say, "What do you want? What will it involve? You know what we can afford." There is then a discussion and the three people voluntarily undertake to pay a little money, perhaps over a period of years, in order to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
The council then says, "There is still another person." In other cases there might be another ten people. The council says, "What about him?" And he says, "I will not pay." The council's reply is, "We still do not see why we should pay all this out of the county rates while he does not contribute. We do not want the scheme particularly; we have plenty of others and we will leave this one out." As a result the poor farmers will not have the benefit of the scheme and they will not have the greater efficiency of agriculture which we are all hoping to get and which would make them less poor. They are all disadvantaged, because of one man or four men or forty men who will not do what their colleagues, who are no better off, have agreed to do. They all suffer, nothing is done, no road is improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend seeks to say that in such a case, if the others are willing to contribute and it is a condition on which alone the council will carry out the scheme, then it ought to be possible to bring the non-co-operators in. That is a wholly defensible argument. It is one which we have accepted in many cases. What about poor farmers who want electricity? There are farmers in the uplands in my constituency who have as big a struggle as anybody in Wales to make a living. They want electricity. The Regional Electricity Board is one of the best in the country but it says, "We will provide electricity if you will all contribute." The basis of the contribution is discussed and it usually involves a payment or a guarantee every year over a period of years. I have one case in my constituency at the moment in which a couple of the farmers refuse to contribute and the Board says, "We will not go on with it." As a result, all the farmers lose the electricity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the two farmers are not forced to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to see it done, because I think it is wrong that all the other farmers in the area should lose electricity because of two awkward chaps who do not want the improvements and who do not want to be good farmers. It is wrong that all the farmers who want to improve the roads so that they can farm better and more prosperously should
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
be refused that improvement because of one or two others who may make a little money out of cattle dealing and are not as much concerned with increasing the efficiency of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All civilised society law consists of some compulsions on the citizen. All communal benefits involve some contra-charges. That being so, it is no use holding up our hands in horror. Which will give the greatest benefit for the farmers affected by the Bill? In my view that will be done by enabling the councils to enter into agreements. Let us then take it one step further. Where the majority are willing to contribute and the council can enter into an agreement, we must accept the principle that the minority must fall into line with their fellow farmers and make their contribution. If the majority in a given area flanking a certain road are willing to make their contribution, albeit with some difficulty, then it is very unlikely that others farming the same land flanking the same road are so poor that they cannot afford it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, who is a Welshman, has not moved the Amendment because he wants to charge Welsh farmers more money. It is no use the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) trying to play a little politics; he is too new in the game for that. My hon. Friend says "There are some farmers in Wales who will not get the benefit of the Bill because the council will refuse to put up schemes without contributions all round." My hon. Friend wants to make sure that a minority of selfish or non-co-operative farmers cannot rob the remainder of the farmers of the benefits which the Bill will give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not an unreasonable case. The practice is well known. All the Amendment does is to say that if this scheme is to be done and if one of the conditions is that there should be a private contribution, and if two-thirds of those concerned are willing to make a private contribution, then the non-co-operating one-third ought to come into line. That is a good doctrine and I think it is a very good Amendment. I think it meets what will be a problem, and I should have thought that the Committee could accept it without trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with the feeling of the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) which seeks to protect a relatively small farmer from having an imposition placed upon him in this way. I appreciate that concern, for we all know that in Wales there are farmers with very small acreages of very difficult land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have, however, been looking into the matter on the basis of figures given by the Minister and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary. It has been said that it would cost £2,000 to put one mile of this kind of road in order. The grant could be 85 per cent., but, taking a grant of 75 per cent., which means £1,500 a mile, we are left with £500 to be found by the council or by the council and the farmers concerned. The cost could reasonably be divided equally between the local authority and the farmers, which would place an imposition of £250 on, say, three farmers. It is likely that the number of farmers involved would be more than three, and three is a conservative figure to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we divide £250 among three farmers, using that conservative figure, it amounts to £80 per farmer, granting that each farmer has an equal acreage and an equal usage of the road. A sum of £80 as a share for improving the road does not seem excessive, especially if there is provision for the payment of that money in instalments over, say, five years, which is about £16 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is £80 a mile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am taking a road which is only a mile long. There are a large number of roads about a mile long. In my constituency, there are access roads of half-a-mile, three-quarters-of-a-mile and a mile. There are, of course, roads far longer, but this is a reasonable average to take and, even for a very small farmer, £16 a year is reasonable. I hope that the hon. Member for Yarmouth, whose support for struggling Welsh farmers is deeply appreciated, will not press the matter too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going on the advice of people from Wales who commented on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given the hon. Gentleman a little additional advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree straight away that this is a reasonable argument very persuasively put and that there is a nice balance in deciding the right thing to do. I assure the Committee that we have given it a good deal of thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price) on Second Reading and mentioned this morning. When considerable sums of public money are spent which benefit private property, it is not unreasonable that those who benefit should make some contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are dealing in the main with exceptional circumstances. By the very nature of things, both the landowners and the farmers have very limited resources, and because of that we have taken the view outlined in the Bill. There would be the greatest difficulty in following the line of the proposed Amendment, sound though it is in certain principles. First, it is not easy to define who are the benefiting owners. The Amendment wisely provides an appeal procedure to the courts. Straight away we get objections, disturbance of local opinion, and delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, there is the problem of assessing how the additional cost is to be shared. It is suggested that an acreage basis should be used, and that seems logical, but Welsh hon. Members will agree that the acres in Wales vary vastly in their value. Some other means would have to be found as well if the burden were to be in any way equitable. I do not know whether we could relate it to a rental basis as an alternative; I suppose we could consider that, but, even so, it would not necessarily bring equity into sharing the burden. Once again there would no doubt be objections from those who felt they could not afford it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make one small point which has not been mentioned. It would be worth considering. The main purpose of the Amendment is to prevent a scheme from being frustrated by an unco-operative member of that community. There might be lack of cooperation because of poverty, but I can think of other reasons. There might be an access road extending a couple of miles from the nearest classified road into the higher reaches of a mountain valley where there were hill farms producing sheep and wool. In the lower regions,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
at the 500 ft. contour, there might be a residential estate which, for amenity reasons, did not want the road to be carried on to the higher ground, because it might take traffic and tourists interfering with the amenities of the landscape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put that as a serious point, and I am thinking of places in Derbyshire and the Lake District, as well as others. In such a situation, the main purpose of the Bill, which is to assist the hill farmers, would be frustrated by the selfish objections of some local residents in the lower reaches of a valley; and surely the Government or the council should have some powers to deal with that situation. Will the Minister consider that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the argument turns on the possibility of an uncooperative landowner or farmer being unwilling to come in and so frustrating the progress of a scheme. I agree that such circumstances could arise with the Bill in its present form where the matter is left completely open on a voluntary basis. On the other hand, if either landowners or farmers concerned were anxious to proceed with a scheme, if they wished they could of course increase their own contributions. They might well say that it was worth it to them in the circumstances and that they were willing to carry the party who was not co-operative. I do not say they would always do that, but it is a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that on the face of it the argument of the right hon. Member and his hon. Friends is a reasonable one. If a county council said "We are not going ahead unless we get contributions from local people sufficient to cover the proportion we have to pay," and one or two owners stood out and would not cooperate, a scheme might not go forward. I agree that that is a difficulty, but we have to set against it the difficulties of finding the benefiting owners, secondly, finding a fair basis of assessment and, thirdly, taking into account the fact that in the main we are dealing with poor areas.

We have been considerably influenced by reference to the Rural Development Panel of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire which advised us on no account to make compulsory levies because of the general impoverishment of
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
the Welsh counties. It is nevertheless possible that even in the Welsh counties there will be areas where they could well contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not got the full Report before me, but I have it fixed in my mind that what that Council was offering advice about was the idea of compulsory levies altogether—the idea of making a compulsory levy as a condition in all cases. That is not quite the point we are putting here. I can see the objections of the Council to compulsory levies as a general principle, but we are saying that in the specific case where voluntary contributions are offered for two-thirds there should be a compulsory levy for the one-third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to visualise the page in the Report, which I read carefully, and I think that it was on a rather different point that the Council tendered advice. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would be willing to have further consultation with the Council and other people on this question, the force of which he appreciated. In that event, there would be a compulsory levy on a few people, which would help to put a scheme through, whereas the advice of the Council, I feel, did not cover that specific question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a feeling that the right hon. Member is on the right track and that the advice of the Council was certainly dealing with the general question of a compulsory levy. I am not able to say straight off the bat whether the Council was specifically consulted on the point raised in the Amendment. I shall certainly undertake before Report stage to put that specific matter to the Council. The general advice I have had is that the view of the Council is against any kind of compulsory levy. Therefore, the balance of the argument lies on the side we have taken that on the whole it would be better not to make a provision of this kind. However, I will certainly undertake between now and Report to give further thought to the matter and to put that point specifically to the Council. If we can take a different view then we shall be prepared to do so, but I must make it plain that we feel that at present we have the right balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I sincerely hope that we shall have the help of the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) on this Amendment. When he opposes us it brings a happy result on the other side of the Committee, and if he opposes the Amendment I have a feeling that an undertaking will be given. Looking at the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, I can always tell when he is in a conciliatory mood and I think that such a mood is coming upon him at the moment. Therefore, I shall content myself with a short explanation of the Amendment. If I find I am wrong in my surmise and that the hon. Gentleman is not in that happy mood, I shall have to pursue the matter at greater length and with more vigour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is here a small one. In the Clause the Minister has sought to give a definition to the term "highway." It is a definition only for this Bill, and no doubt for that purpose it is a good one, but it brings us up against the problem with which many good folk are concerned in the preservation of open spaces and footpaths, as this definition is different from the definition which has stood the test of time. The original definition of "highway" goes back well into the nineteenth century. It was defined under the Highway Act of 1835 and re-defined in the same terms in 1891. It has remained very much the bible for those who, very properly, are concerned to maintain our open spaces and footpaths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people have been in touch with me and are very worried about this matter. Even though the definition may be good for this Bill, once a Measure contains a definition which is different from that which holds the field we might find ourselves in trouble with legislation. As it would be the most modern definition it might be held to take precedence over the ancient definition. If the definition of highway were taken out of the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
altogether it would not upset the Bill very much and consequential Amendments would not be required. Rather than repeat the exhaustive definition of 1891 we suggest that the definition should be taken out altogether. I understand that there is an Act dealing with this matter and that any question of definition would be dealt with by reference to the original definition, in this case the one in the 1891 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take out the definition we do not leave "highway" undefined, as it will be defined by reference to the original definition. There would be no whittling down of the definition and no one would be put in peril. As the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society does such excellent and useful work, I feel that no one—not even the hon. Member for Yarmouth—would want to make the Society's work more difficult or in any way to reduce its value. In that spirit I offer the Amendment, and hope that the hon. Gentleman will short-circuit the discussion by telling us that he can accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies to the plea made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown), I wish to add a few words in support of the Amendment. The definition of the term "highway" is very limited. As an old rambler and lover of the countryside I strongly object to the definition in many connotations. When I think of the highway I think of it in the old sense as the King's Highway on which I have a right to walk, in the sense in which Jeffrey Farnol spoke of "The Broad Highway" in a famous novel. If we get infiltration to the statutes of bastard definitions of this kind undoubtedly they will be lifted for other purposes and used to undermine many ancient rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not exaggerated fears. For many years I have been associated with the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society and organisations of a similar kind. We are extremely jealous of the basis on which these rights are founded. I strongly urge the Minister to accept the plea that this limited definition:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'highway' means a way over which the public have a right of passage with vehicles, …"</p></blockquote>
is dangerous in many other connotations affecting our civil rights and privileges,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
rights of access to land and mountains in particular, and ought not to go into this Bill. To some people completely obsessed with administrative convenience, as are most Government Departments—I say that with no disrespect—it may seem that our ancient principles are founded on quite other considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that we shall be able to accept the Amendment and to remove this definition. As the Committee has recognised, it was put in for administrative convenience to indicate to county councils that grants would not be made for making up footpaths or bridle paths, but the Bill will be perfectly sound without it. We are very conscious of the excellent work done by the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society, from whom we have also had representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 2, at the end to insert "resurfacing, channelling, draining."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) and I are anxious about the definition of the word "improvement." As it stands it appears to be just a widening of a road and the cutting off of corners. We should like the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to assure us, if he cannot accept the Amendment, that the definition includes such works as resurfacing, channelling and draining. If not, improvements of some unclassified roads will not be worth anything at all. A large number of improvements can be made to unclassified roads by resurfacing, channelling and draining. The purpose of the Amendment is to obtain an assurance in that direction. If that cannot be included I am afraid we shall have to press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Member the assurance he seeks, that the word "improvement" includes the various processes he mentioned. The definition is drafted in this fashion, stating that it includes widening of the roads and cutting off of corners, because normally "improvement" would not include that, but it does include such things as resurfacing, channelling and so on. I am advised that if we specified the processes suggested by the Amendment we would cast doubt on other things which normally would
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
be included. We would be obliged to go on exhaustively to set out all the things which "improvement" could cover. I certainly give the hon. Member the assurance he seeks, that "improvement" includes the processes that he has stated in his Amendment. I hope, therefore, that he will agree to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for what he has said. The county surveyor for Merioneth is very concerned about this matter and will be pleased to know what has been said this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 2, at the end, to insert "minor reconstruction."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the Amendment to seek clarification. The position might arise that to improve a piece of road in the best possible manner, a small section of new road must be constructed. I hope that for this reason it will be possible to include the words "minor reconstruction." We wish to make the Bill as practicable and useful as possible and not to prevent useful schemes by a mere limitation of words. I believe that the Amendment will be a valuable addition to the definition Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give my hon. Friend the assurance, which has already been given, that the purpose of his Amendment is already covered by the Clause. In this case also, it would be awkward to include words of this kind, for once again they might be taken to exclude other things. "Minor reconstruction" is also a rather vague phrase, which would not add to the ease of interpretation. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will not press his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important Amendment to which, I hope, the Committee will give serious attention. The Title of the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
uses the words "Agriculture (Improvement of Roads)". By agreeing to the Amendment, the Committee would remove from the definition of "livestock rearing area"
	<br><blockquote><p>"… an area consisting predominantly of mountains, hills or heath."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that anything consisting
	<br><blockquote><p>"predominantly of mountains, hills or heath"</p></blockquote>
can be rightly described as agriculture. "Agriculture" has a much wider meaning than the kind of husbandry that is carried on in mountainous areas. If the Amendment is agreed to, a "livestock rearing area" would be defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"an area in which the principal industry, or one of the principal industries, is the breeding, rearing and maintenance of sheep or cattle."</p></blockquote>
It is the very desirable purpose of agricultural policy, and it is accepted, I believe, by everybody, that we should breed more sheep and cattle so as to have greater supplies of home-produced lamb, mutton and beef. One of our present dangers is the possibility of a reduction in the quantity of mutton and beef. If we adhered to the narrow definition of the Clause, we would prevent improvements to roads in areas where more livestock, sheep and cattle could be bred, reared and maintained. From the point of view of national agricultural policy, the Government would be well advised to accept the Amendment and, by deleting these words, broaden the definition of areas to be improved under the Bill and widen the benefit to the country as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was brought out clearly by many hon. Members during Second Reading that the Bill as drafted was too narrow in conception to enable their parts of the country to benefit from it. There are many areas in which, owing to the lack of decent approach roads, farming is suffering and we do not produce all the food that we could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the parish of Shipdham, in my constituency, for example, a road of about half a mile in length meanders down through various fields and reaches a smallholding at the bottom. The man in the smallholding is struggling in poverty, comparable to that in any part of Wales, against great adversities. He is advised that his land requires lime and fertiliser but the state of the road leading to it is such that nobody will deliver lime to the holding. He tries to maintain a certain
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
quantity of stock, but nobody will deliver feedingstuffs to him. He is therefore restricted in what he can produce by the shocking condition of the road leading to his holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That man is not only a farmer but is the father of a large family. Throughout winter, there are difficulties with the education authority when the children do not attend school in the worst conditions. They can attend only if their father is available with his horse and tumbrel to bring them up the long lane. If by altering the definition we extend the Bill, improvement could be effected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago, another farmer drew my attention to the position of his farm. The lane leading to it is not unusually long but it is crossed by a stream. Whenever there is a heavy rainfall, the water comes down from the ditch and floods the road, sometimes to a depth of 3 ft. This makes it impossible for motor vehicles to get through. On occasion there has been serious sickness in the house or the cottages on the farm, but the doctor has been unable to attend when called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farmer obtained an estimate of the cost of building a bridge over the stream. The county surveyor could have had it done for £400, but the man was not in a position to find the money. This was on a public, unclassified road. If the Bill could be applied to the broader aspects of agriculture, we would be able to bring improvements into all parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of the General Election, the National Farmers' Union in Norfolk was very concerned. When it called together all the Parliamentary candidates, this was one of the questions it asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do the candidates agree that the Agriculture (Improvement of Roads) Bill should be one of the first Measures to be dealt with by the new Parliament and that its provisions should be extended to cover unclassified and unadopted roads which serve agricultural holdings and communities in all areas?"</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) was present, and so was the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. J. E. B. Hill), who heard their spokesman, Mr. Bullard, who is no longer a Member of the House, give a reply on their behalf. I have a copy of the Norfolk Farmers' Union Gazette, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. D. Bullard pointed out that this Bill was intended to have only limited scope and to help improve roads in livestock rearing areas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
in the hill districts. He agreed that the Bill was nowhere near enough to tackle the full problem of rural roads and while these could not be tackled piecemeal he was most anxious that they should be tackled as quickly as possible and as the necessary money became available. He"—</p></blockquote>
mistakenly—
	<br><blockquote><p>"could undertake that he and his fellow candidates would do everything they could to obtain further assistance for rural authorities to deal with rural roads."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Yarmouth now has his chance to intervene again in the debate. If the hon. Member adds his eloquence and persuasive powers to the arguments which I can advance, it looks as though we might be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farm roads are essential if we are to improve agriculture throughout the country. If the Parliamentary Secretary can visualise the extent of the problem and indicate that the Government are concerned and will do something about it, either in this or in another Bill, very soon, we shall not have met in vain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another class or road to which reference has been made both during Second Reading and in this Committee: namely, roads in certain areas which during the war were improved for the purpose of increased agricultural output but which are now rapidly deteriorating. I refer, of course, to our Fen roads. The danger is that unless something is done quickly, the roads will deteriorate to such an extent that arable agriculture cannot be maintained in those areas and they will revert to livestock-rearing or fattening areas. It would, of course, be a disadvantage from the national point of view if these Fen roads were not brought within the ambit of the Bill, or some other Bill which the Government may have in mind, and the nation could lose a good deal of agricultural production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to amend the Bill so that Fen roads could qualify for grants and future maintenance, on a basis which did not bear too heavily on the people in the locality, and so that they could become part of our public system of highways, we should have done a good job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also another matter which we must consider. Many roads which in the past have been laid out and constructed for agricultural purposes, have through the development of industry and residen-
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
tial areas, been transferred in their use from agricultural to residential or industrial purposes. That has happened all over the country, and the country is rapidly losing its area of good agricultural land. So often has industrial and residential development taken place on good agricultural land, that this is one of the reasons for the decline in agricultural production. If we are to face the consequences of our loss in agricultural development——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member is going rather beyond the terms of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to come to the point that if we are to lose good agricultural land, then we should seek to replace it by going to the land which is at present under-developed, and which cannot be developed through lack of access. It is the policy of the Ministry of Agriculture to encourage rotational farming, to lay land down to grass for three or five years and then to draw agricultural crops from it. That is prevented where access roads are insufficient. If we can develop some of these roads in such a way that we can improve agriculture, both for livestock and for arable purposes, we can increase productivity of the grassland as well as the arable land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we are faced with the loss of land for other purposes. For instance, we have a great scheme for new motorways. Are we to enable the farming community to apply their knowledge and skill for the better development of land which has not at present good approach roads, or are we to see a decline in the arable acreage and the good grassland acreage? This is the challenge before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All agriculturists hope that the Government will be able, through the Bill or by some other means, to give access to back-land which is now under-developed, and which can be brought into greater agricultural productivity. If the Minister could see his way to study this problem, either by enlarging the Bill or by assuring the Committee that he has in mind other means of saving our agricultural land or increasing its productivity by road schemes, I think that the moving of the Amendment will not have been in vain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, we know, as has been shown in Report after Report, that development for other purposes over good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
agricultural land is going on, and unless we can have good, hard roads to give access to land which is now under-developed, we shall see a continuous decline in British agriculture, to the detriment of the country as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. G. Gooch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to detain the Committee for very long, because I hope that it may be possible for us to conclude consideration of the Bill today. I want to reinforce one or two of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Southwest (Mr. Dye).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true, as he says, that during the period prior to the Election all the candidates, irrespective of party, in the county of Norfolk were called together by the National Farmers' Union. We were talked to seriously about what was and what was not in this Bill. The indication given by the gentleman, who is no longer a Member of Parliament, in the name of all the Conservative candidates for Norfolk still stands. I am surprised to see the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell), who was very talkative that day, has left the room. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. J. E. B. Hill) has been very silent up to now, but I hope that he will come in and reinforce the agreement that he entered into when he was in the presence of the whole of the governing body of the Norfolk Farmers' Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We pointed out to the Farmers' Union in our county—I certainly did—when it asked us to take in hand this Bill, from a very definite standpoint, that, so far as we could see, the provisons of the Bill did not apply to a county like Norfolk. However, the Union was adamant and it suggested to us that, although it was perhaps obvious that the Bill did not apply to a county like Norfolk, it would be up to the Norfolk Members of Parliament to press the point that just as rural Wales had its peculiar needs in this regard, so had rural Norfolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It now becomes apparent the longer we debate this that the sum contained in the Bill for the carrying out of this work is completely inadequate. What I have been disturbed about during the whole of the morning since the Minister first spoke is that hardly anyone, except my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Southwest has discussed the amenity value of
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
the Bill. That is where I started in discussing the Bill and I hope that I shall finish by stressing the amenity value of improving roads in the rural areas. My hon. Friend for Norfolk, South-West quoted an example in his Parliamentary division. I could quote dozens of examples of a similar character. We should have regard to the fact that the Minister, who is supporting this miserable Bill and trying to get it through, came into our Parliamentary divisions and made speeches which were quite contrary in spirit to the spirit of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I represent one of the loveliest parts of Britain. People go there for the benefit of their health, and I suspect that that is partly why the Minister went to my Parliamentary division on Saturday last, after having spent a considerable amount of time there in May of this year. I am sorry that the Minister is not here now, because I want to quote what he said. In the speech, which he delivered then, in the middle of my division, he is reported as having said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's object was to make conditions as good as possible for those who earned their livelihood in the country, and that was why it was pushing ahead with improvements in rural amenities. He added that though the rate of progress was faster today in all these amenities, it must at times seem disappointingly slow for those who were waiting for them."</p></blockquote>
That is perfectly true. That is why we at first demurred when this Bill proposed to allow a long period of years in which to carry these schemes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These schemes need to be tackled not merely from the farming standpoint, with which I agree, but from the amenity angle, and particularly from the point of view of those who have to get to what are now inaccessible places by means of public transport. I was interested to see that after the Minister made his speech on Saturday in my division, defending the Government in connection with its progress or non-progress of agricultural policy, that even the Tory candidate took him up on the question of rural amenities and suggested—and this is what I want to suggest—that the improvement of rural roads should be regarded not merely from the agricultural standpoint but also from the amenity standpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Minister said, in reply to the Tory candidate in North Norfolk on Saturday last, that the Ministry of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
Transport was very sympathetic to the idea of small buses, and perhaps some small buses could be put on the roads of rural areas. But I suggest that the Bill—a miserable affair—ought really to be taken back by the Minister. He should get new authority to come forward with a new Bill, which will not only give satisfaction to agriculture, but which will enable people who have to live and work in rural Britain to enjoy some of the finer things in life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, I think that this is the right stage for me to say that it is in my discretion to allow the Committee to sit until 1.15, provided I hold the view that our proceedings can be terminated by that time. Of course, there is no extension, even for a few seconds, beyond 1.15. I hold the view, after consultation with hon. Members about the further Amendments, that we could conclude our deliberations on the Committee stage by 1.15, but I should like to remind the Committee that Clauses 5 and 6 and the Schedule have to be dealt with before the Committee stage is finished. If hon. Members who are speaking in a few minutes' time would remember that fact, I think that we could conclude the Committee stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is hardly time for a satisfactory reply to the points which have been put. I know that it was the intention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown), who had to leave the Committee, to say something on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had an assurance from the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins) who, I think, is now leading for the Opposition that there would be some co-operation. If there has been a change of view, I am quite prepared to stop the Sitting at one o'clock, but I still think that the Committee stage could be concluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened, as I am sure the Committee has, with interest to the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) and the hon. Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Gooch), in support of the Amendment, which seeks to widen the scope of the Bill. The Bill as drafted intends to define a livestock rearing area in the same terms as the Hill Farming
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
and Livestock Rearing Acts. In other words, it would, broadly speaking, limit the benefit of the Bill to the upland areas. The effect of the Amendment would be to extend the benefits to all areas throughout the country where livestock are being reared. I sympathise with the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West and his hon. Friend in what they wish to do. Indeed, we had a survey made in England and Wales as to the extent of the problem of unclassified and unadopted roads in the lowland areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly recognise that there are problems—of course, there are—throughout the country, and that Norfolk is no different from many other counties. In the main it would be true to say that the problem in the lowland areas, although in some cases acute, is not so acute as in the upland areas. It is because, as I said on Second Reading, everyone recognises that there is a special problem in the upland areas, that we thought it right to come along with this Bill to make a start in those areas and to commit this large sum of money—£4 million of public money—to improving the roads in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already defined the particular areas in the Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts. Much very valuable work has been done in improving large numbers of farms in these areas, and making them stronger economic units. The Measure which is now before the Committee will have the effect of completing that work, and of ensuring that in difficult upland areas there will now be adequate access so that these improved farms, and, indeed, other farms which might be improved there, will have the benefit of reasonable access as well as having their own fixed equipment, and thus they will become more economic units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the right approach is the gradual one. Let us try this Measure in those areas, already clearly defined, which are acknowledged to be an exceptional problem. Let us see how it goes on there, and perhaps at some time in the future it may be possible for the Government of the day to look at the lowland areas. This is a new departure and I think it obviously right that we should approach it step by step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, of course, very familiar with the problem of the Fen roads. Indeed, in one way and another I have tried to be

of some assistance there. I am sorry that I am not able to do anything today to meet the hon. Member's argument. I realise the difficulties that he has had there. I say to the Committee that the Measure that we are proposing will do precisely what the hon. Gentleman wants in helping to bring into production these undeveloped areas and in making a beginning in the most difficult places. That, after all, is the beginning we all want to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pace at which we can go on into other areas is something which will have to be looked at at some future time. Today, I feel it right that the Bill should be limited to the hill-farming and livestock-rearing areas. I therefore ask the Committee, the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends to accept our general expression of sympathy with the problems in the lowland areas, and to agree that the Bill should be limited to the livestock-rearing areas. Let us make a start there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<i>It being One o'Clock,</i> The CHAIRMAN, 	<i>pursuant to Standing Order No</i>. 63 (	<i>Meetings of Standing Committees</i>), 	<i>deferred adjourning the Committee</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 7, after "hills" to insert "rough grazings."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a small drafting Amendment. I feel that the wording of the Bill does not quite cover the case of Scotland. I have had representations that if the words "rough grazings" were included that would improve the clarity of the Bill. I trust that the Joint Under-Secretary of State may be able to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend realises that this is rather more than a drafting Amendment. I assure him that all land which is covered by the Hill Farming Act and the Livestock Rearing Act will be covered by the definition in the Bill. As that is what I think he really wants, I hope that he will withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on that, can the Parliamentary Secretary assure the Committee that he will not include in this definition any areas primarily used for rough shooting and for preserving game?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that no one shoots over the areas that may benefit

in this way. I add the qualification that, in accepting schemes, we shall look to see that they will be of benefit to agricultural and forestry interests. We are not concerned if there is also a shooting interest. Our concern is with agricultural and forestry interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious point and I put it because I know, as do other hon. Members, that in many parts of the mountainous areas of this country some of the shooting rights are very valuable and are let at very high rents. If we are to be involved in haggles about the percentage of grant under the discretion which the Minister has retained for himself, the question of pieces of high ground which are primarily shooting preserves ought to be taken into consideration. The Minister cannot brush a matter like that aside with a wave of the hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No question of shooting rights arises out of the words "rough grazing."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Minister has said, I will not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment by leave withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>Schedule agreed to.</p>
	<p>Motion made and Question proposed, That the Bill, as amended, be reported to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we conclude, may I have the pleasure and privilege of expressing our thanks to you, Sir Leonard, and to the officials of the Committee? You have graciously and efficiently presided over the proceedings. I thank you for the expeditious manner in which you have taken care of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, on behalf of my hon. and right hon. Friends, associate myself with what the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</p>
