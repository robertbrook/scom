	<p>Sub-section (4) of Section nine of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925, is hereby repealed, and the following sub-section shall be substituted therefor:
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) If a workman who has so far recovered from the injury as to be fit for employment of a certain kind has failed to obtain such employment, he shall be deemed not to be able to earn wages and the judge shall order that his incapacity shall, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as total incapacity resulting from the injury for such period, and subject to such conditions, as may be provided by the order, without prejudice, however, to the right of review conferred by this Act:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that every such order shall be made subject to the condition that it shall cease to be in force if the workman receives unemployment benefit:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided also that no such order shall be made if it is proved to the satisfaction of the county counrt that the workman has not taken all reasonable steps to obtain employment as aforesaid.</p></blockquote></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving this Amendment, it may be for the convenience of the Committee, and facilitate the passage of the Bill, if I make a general statement as to the Amendments which stand in my name upon the Amendment Paper. The Committee will remember that when this Bill was before the House on Second Reading, which it duly received, there was a general agreement as to the existence of a grievance arising out of the decision in the case of Bevan 	<i>v</i>. Nixon's Navigation Company, and there was an equal con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
sensus of opinion as to the desirability of finding some basis of agreement and such words as would restore the law as it was understood to exist in the Acts of 1923 and 1925. It was clear that there was considerable opposition to the exact terms of the Bill as it was drafted, and, in view of that opposition, I ventured to approach the promoters to see if they would be willing for some negotiations to take place. They expressed a willingness for my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General and myself to make such overtures, and various conferences have been held with my right hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hacking), who is leading for the Oppotion. We discussed fully and clearly the Bill as drafted, and as a result of the warm co-operation of the hon. and learned Member for Norwood (Sir W. Greaves-Lord) and the hon. and learned Member for Altrincham (Mr. Atkinson), we were able to find a basis of agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The various suggested Amendments were submitted to our Parliamentary adviser and draftsman, and he has embodied them in a new draft of the Clause. They completely change the drafting of the Measure, but we are all satisfied that they restore the law as it was up to the decision in the case of Bevan v. Nixon's Navigation Company. Having secured a draft of the amended Bill, I consulted the various parties again, including the promoters. I also saw the hon. Member for West Middlesbrough (Mr. Griffith), of whose interest in this matter we are well aware, for he was the first to call the attention of the House to the grievance arising from that decision. I am glad to tell the Committee that if these Amendments which stand in my name are accepted, there is complete agreement among all parties in the House. That applies to the promoters, who were consulted. In these circumstances, I trust that this statement will obviate a lengthy discussion, and that hon. Members will be satisfied with the assurance that I have given them, supported as it is by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General, by our learned advisers, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chorley, and by the hon. Member for West Middlesbrough, that we have attained our purpose and object, and especially the object of the promoters. In order that the Committee may see at a glance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>327</span>
what the Clause will be like with these Amendments, I have secured a copy of it as it will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Sub-section (4) of Section nine of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925, is hereby repealed, and the following sub-section shall be stibstituted therefor:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4) If a workman who has so far recovered from the injury as to be fit for employment of a certain kind has failed to obtain employment and it appears to the county court judge either—
	<ol>
	<li>that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is probable that the workman would, but for the continuing effects of the injury, be able to obtain work in the same grade in the same class of employment as before the accident; or</li>
	<li>that his failure to obtain employment is a consequence, wholly or mainly, of the injury,</li></ol>
the judge shall order that the workman's incapacity shall be treated as total incapacity resulting from the injury for such period, and subject to such conditions, as may be provided by the order, without prejudice, however, to the right of review conferred by this Act:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that—
	<ol>
	<li>no order shall be made under this sub-section if it appears to the judge that the workman has not taken all reasonable steps to obtain employment; and</li>
	<li>every such order shall be made subject to the condition that it shall cease to be in force if the workman receives unemployment benefit.'"</li></ol></p></blockquote>
There are two further Amendments in my name on the Paper: At the end of Clause 1 to add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) As from the passing of this Act the provisions of the sub-section so substituted as aforesaid shall apply in any case where the accident happened on or after the first day of January, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, and an application for weekly payments to be reviewed in accordance with those provisions may be made, notwithstanding that there has not been, any change in the condition of the workman or any change of circumstances other than the passing of this Act,"</p></blockquote>
and in Clause 2, to leave out "1930," and to insert instead thereof the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"1931, and the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 192,5 to 1930, and this Act may be cited together as the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1925 to 1931."</p></blockquote>
It is clear that these two Amendments stand on their own, and have no reference to the Clause as amended by the other Amendments to which I have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DOUGLAS HACKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>. The Committee will be obliged to the Under-Secretary of State for the statement that he has made. He is quite right when he says that negotiations have taken place, and that he and the Solicitor-General very fairly met certain Members on this side of the House who, on the Second Reading of the original Bill, disagreed with the provisions then contained in it. The Under-Secretary of State should also be thanked for having taken the trouble to give us the text of Clause 1 as it will be amended if all the Amendments which he has on the Paper are acceptable to the Committee. I hope that they will be found acceptable, for if they are, the Bill, as far as we are concerned, will have an easy passage into law. If, on the other hand, they are not acceptable, all I can say is that there may be a great deal more difficulty—I say this in a friendly spirit—in getting this matter settled, and reversing the decision in the case of Bevan v. Nixon's Navigation Company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has also said that it was the original intention of the Act that this decision should never have occurred; in other words, this decision upset the intention of those people who placed the original Workmen's Compensation Acts upon the Statute Book, and it is our desire and, I think, the desire of the promoters of the Bill, that there should be re-inserted into the original Acts what was always the intention of the House that they should contain. This Bill, as amended by the Under-Secretary, will do that; it will carry out the original intentions of the Workmen's Compensation Act. It will do that and nothing more, and for that reason we accept the statement that has been made by the hon. Gentleman. We will accept the Amendments when he moves them. We are grateful to him for the happy solution which we believe he has found, and we congratulate him and his legal advisers on the way that they have dealt with this rather intricate Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a letter from my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Norwood (Sir W. Greaves-Lord), who tells me that he cannot be here this morning as he is detained at the Preston Sessions. He entirely agrees with the Bill as it will, I hope, leave the Committee when the Amendments which the Under-Secre-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
tary proposes to move are inserted. He agrees that the effect of the new proposals will be to put the law into the position in which everyone thought it was before the Bevan case. He believes that that will be fair to everyone, and will prevent any recurrence of an injustice —which we all agree that it was—such as occurred in that case. He wishes to give the Bill his blessing if it is passed in the amended form, and to associate himself with my congratulations and thanks to the Under-Secretary of State and to his legal advisers in what, I hope, will be a happy solution of this controversy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KINGSLEY GRIFFITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the great grandfather of this Bill, I want to say a word. When I drafted the original Bill, within 48 hours of the decision of the House of Lords in the case of Bevan v. Nixon's Navigation Company, I was a very new Member of the House, and a very inexperienced draftsman. Consequently, certain defects appeared in the original Bill, and they have been too faithfully followed in the subsequent Bills. I am very glad that the Bill has now, by the work of the Under-Secretary and of the Solicitor-General, been put in a form which will command general assent. I am well aware that the Bill as it is proposed to be amended does not do everything that some hon. Members opposite, and, perhaps, I myself, would desire, but we have to learn in this matter the wisdom of taking what can actually be got and what is practical, and not straining after something which might be attractive, but which could never be carried at all, at any rate in the present House, and I hope that, whatever disappointment there may be about the Bill not, perhaps, going as far as some would like, we shall all concentrate on the real chance of getting this very beneficial piece of legislation passed, which can only be done by accepting it in the form in which it is now put forward by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original intention was to make the minority judgments in Bevan 	<i>v</i>. Nixon's Navigation Company—namely, the judgments of those most distinguished Law Lords, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline and Lord Blanesburgh—operative as if they had been in the majority. I am satisfied that the text of the proposed new Bill, as amended, does that. I think that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
should be content with that, and should be very grateful, not only to those who have officially undertaken the task of amending the Bill, but also to hon. Members of the official Opposition, and particularly the hon. and learned Member for Norwood (Sir W. Greaves-Lord) for the great assistance they have rendered in putting it into acceptable form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TINKER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry I cannot altogether agree with what has been said by representatives of all three parties. To me, the amended Clause seems to be far wide of what was originally intended. During the discussion on the Second Reading, I gathered from the opposite benches that there was some kind of opposition to the intention that we had in mind, and I expected that some attempt would be made to get the points of objection dealt with in an agreed Measure; but I must say that I feel that the spirit of what we intended has not been carried out, and I must raise my objections until I am more satisfied that the injured workman will get a fair deal after the adoption of this amended Clause. I want to find out from the Home Office if it carries out what I have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would point out that cases of this kind are not confined to the mining industry; the Workmen's Compensation Act is far wider than that; but this particular case has arisen in. the industry for which I speak, and, naturally, I deal with it from that standpoint. Suppose that a miner is injured, and is then found to be fit for light work, but that the employer cannot find him that light work, although his original job as a collier is going, and the employer refuses to pay any more than partial compensation. Do I take it that in that case the county court judge would not then be able to award full compensation to that man, because the employer could not find him a suitable job? Let us further suppose that the colliery at which he works had closed down, when, obviously, there would be no employment for him, but that the 200 workmen alongside whom he worked had all been found work in other collieries. Would he then be able to claim full compensation, even though the colliery had stopped altogether, and I had been able to prove that all the other men alongside whom he worked had found work? Would the old argument then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>331</span>
come in that he was debarred from getting work owing to the state of trade? These are points that I want to see cleared up before I give my assent to these present proposals. I gather that another hon. Member on this side, the bon. and learned Member for West Swansea (Mr. H. W. Samuel) has agreed to this, but I have been looking up his speech, and I find that, in answer to the hon. and learned Member for Norwood (Sir W. Greaves-Lord), he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I see no difficulty in the application of this Bill, and, if I may say so, I speak as one who has had some experience in the administration of the present Act of Parliament."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th November, 1930; col. 2058, Vol. 244.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. and learned Member is a lawyer and would understand the drafting of the Bill before the House, and he argued before the House that it just filled up the position that we desired to fill up. I understand that he agrees with the Home Office that this other wording is equally applicable to our intentions. I must be satisfied on these points before I can agree to this Measure. Until I get an understanding on these points, I am afraid I must raise my opposition, even although it may be, as the hon. Member for West Middlesbrough (Mr. K. Griffith) has</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Question proposed, "That those words be there inserted."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ANEURIN BEVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to raise a point here; I do not know whether it is in order. I find myself in great difficulty. I came into the Committee this morning, and found the draft of the Bill before the Committee and a number of Amendments on the Paper. Now there has been put into my hands a proposed alternative to the total language of the Bill, and I am expected to make up my mind at a moment's notice. Divisions are taken, and I have not had</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
	<p>said, that we cannot get anything more. I would far rather not take any partial Measure which does not meet the position that our people thought would be met, than deceive them as to what they expected to have, and I do not want to accept some half-Measure that will not clear the position as we want it to be cleared. Therefore, I must raise my objection until I get a satisfactory answer on the points I have mentioned.</p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall be deemed not to be able to earn wages, and,"</p></blockquote>
and to insert instead thereof the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and it appears to the county court judge either—
	<ol>
	<li>that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is probable that the workman would, but for the continuing effects of the injury, be able to obtain work in the same grade in the same class of employment as before the accident; or</li>
	<li>that his failure to obtain employment is a consequence, wholly or mainly, of the injury."</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 5; Noes, 19.</p>
	<p>the slightest opportunity of determining what is the incidence of these proposals.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member came in this morning—unfortunately, late—the Under-Secretary indicated the reason for putting this proposed text of the Sub-section on paper, and I think the Committee generally felt that it was an advantage to have it so put down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I came in while the hon. Gentleman was addressing the Committee, but I failed to learn from him
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
what would be the precise effect of the alterations. I did learn that consultation had taken place and some agreement had been reached, but I did not hear a specific case made out for the alternative Clause, and I think that the Committee is entitled to an explanation of it. If we are going to make progress with this Bill, the Committee ought to have an opportunity of looking carefully into the actual consequences of the alternative which has been placed before them, so that we might on subsequent discussion be able to agree with the hon. Gentleman; but at this stage I am sorry to say I am compelled to oppose every alteration as it arises, unless we can have an opportunity of adjourning to consider the effect of the alternative wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GORDON MACDONALD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to support what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. A. Bevan). Is it not possible for us to have an adjournment to consider this new draft, which alters the position? The Under-Secretary has not answered the specific questions of my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker); we have had no answer as to what will happen in such cases as he mentioned, and that arouses more suspicion still. We had better know where we are going, and, in my opinion, to continue this discussion now is not going to be beneficial, or to lead to the realisation of the promoters' aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I be permitted to answer the questions of the hon. Member? I understand that, if these Amendments which I have put down are accepted, and if the Committee accept the draft which I have circulated, the answer to those questions, so far as it is reasonably possible for me to answer at all, is in the affirmative. At the same time, however, I think all members of the Committee will recognise that the matter must be left with the county court judge; but, so far as I am able to express an opinion, and as I am advised, the answer to those questions is in the affirmative. I do not want to repeat what I have already said, but I am surprised at some of the opposition to this proposal, because I understood that the matter was generally agreed upon, and I hope that the Committee will try to adopt the attitude of the hon. Member for West Middlesbrough (Mr. B. Griffith),
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
and seek to find a. settlement of this very controversial issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say that I like to take some sort of intelligent interest in what I am doing, in a committee or elsewhere; and I must say, with great respect to the Under-Secretary, that, although I listened carefully to what he had to say, it is, quite frankly, impossible for me to realise exactly the full purport of all that is being proposed here this morning. I think I may say that everyone in this room is anxious that a decent Workmen's Compensation Bill should be promoted, but it is asking rather much from us to expect that we can fully comprehend the whole significance of these proposals as the Amendments come along, and one of two things must happen. Either it would be advisable for us to adjourn until, say, Tuesday, so that we may know the full implications of what we are dealing with; or I personally shall suffer from such a lack of knowledge with regard to its full implications that I shall be compelled simply not to vote at all if any other Divisions take place, because I shall not know what I am voting upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROWSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few words with regard to the agreement which has been reached with the various parties. I think that the hon. Member for West Middlesbrough (Mr. B. Griffith) put the case very aptly when he said that what is in this Bill may be all that we shall be able to get from the present House of Commons. There need be no ambiguity about what we desired in the original Bill. The idea was that if a workman was injured, and the employer failed to find that man work, and the man failed to obtain work by his own efforts, he should be regarded not as partially, but as being totally incapacitated. Along with other hon. Members I have met the representatives of the Home Office and the Solicitor-General, and I am willing to accede to the point which has been put by the hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new draft of this Clause which has been put before us does not give us entirely what we want, but I think we are all agreed that it reverses the position laid down in the case of Bevan v. Nixon's Navigation Company. Although we are not prepared to say that we are satisfied with this new draft, we are inclined to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
regard it as all we can get through at the present moment. It is now a question as to whether we are prepared to accept half a loaf instead of going the whole hog. We are advised that what is now proposed changes the position. So far as I am concerned, I saw an early copy of this draft, and I realised the disadvantage of hon. Members who did not see it before the Committee met. As the Seconder of this Bill, I am perfectly willing to agree to the adjournment of the Committee until, say, next Tuesday, in order to see if hon. Members can come to some agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proper course would be to move the Adjournment of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. BEVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Committee do now adjourn."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more I look at this alternative proposal, the more apprehensive. I become. The points which were put before the House on the Second Reading of this Bill have not, in my judgment, been met in the alternative draft. Some of us have had such an unfortunate experience in the County Court in consequence of the existing law that we want to be very particular about the drafting of any new legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all sure that the Committee would be wise in adjourning, and I should like the Under-Secretary to guide us in this matter. I would like to ask if, in case we adjourn, there is any danger of not getting next Friday week for the consideration of the Report stage and the Third Reading of this Bill in the House of Commons? If there is that danger, I hope my hon. friends will very carefully consider this point before deciding to adjourn the Committee. I agree with those hon. Members who have stated that this Measure does not contain what we set out to obtain. I know that certain conversations have taken place, and certain words in the Bill have been changed, but what has been stated seems to me to justify the acceptance of this amended Measure as giving a goodly proportion of what we set out to obtain, not in 1929, but in 1923.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those hon. Members who happen to be resident in industrial areas know some-
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
thing of the misfortunes of injured workmen. We should recognise the injury which is inflicted upon tens of thousands of people in this country, and we ought to be very careful about accepting anything that leaves things as they are at the present moment. On the assurances which have been given to the Committee, I feel that I should be doing the injured workman an injustice if I did anything to delay the passing of this Bill. Instead of supporting the Motion for the Adjournment, I suggest to my hon. Friends that we might settle down to consider carefully any word or words in the Bill which create doubt or anxiety in the minds of hon. Members as to the actual effect of the amended words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment which was before the Committee prior to the Motion for the Adjournment contains a few words to which I originally took exception, and even now I feel apprehensive that those words may be misused in the County Courts. Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept the assurances of my hon. and learned Friend, who has had a tremendous amount of experience in compensation work, and I think we should be well advised to accept the compromise which has been suggested. If we find on the Report stage that the Bill does not give the injured workman that to which he is entitled, and if we feel that an improved Measure could be got through the House, we ought to press for it on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LAWTHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Adjournment has been moved in order to see whether the Amendments proposed fit in with the Measure as originally proposed by the promoters. This compromise has been discussed very carefully, and we have had the help of members of the legal profession on all sides, men who have had much practical experience in dealing with this particular class of case. The result was that we came to the conclusion that the original intention which we had in mind in introducing the Bill, namely, to give to the injured workman the compensation which was originally intended in the Act, would be possible under the proposed new Clause. As to the point raised that the new draft of the Clause does not give the workman the right to which, we believe, he is entitled, I would like to say that there has never yet been a Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
drafted on any subject, the discussion of which has not shown that men with practical experience differ from the lawyers' point of view. If doubts exist in regard to the suggested new Clause, it must still be left to be interpreted by the County Court judges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what was said by the hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. Williams) on this point, and by one of our colleagues who spoke on the Second Reading, that it is felt that at least the amended Clause does put right what was intended in the original Act, and that is what we all desire. I agree that what is now proposed does not give us all that we want. We really desire an entirely new Bill, but the point we have to consider is whether this particular Bill, with the proposed Amendment, will give to the mining industry what was intended in the original Act. The right hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hacking) has already indicated that there is a possibility of what is now proposed being accepted by the present House of Commons, and we all know that not much has been accepted by the present House of Commons from the Trade Union point of view. I should like to be able to say at the end of this Session that, at any rate, we have been able to do something for workmen who are injured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ERNEST WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather inclined to take the view which has been expressed by the hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) with regard to the possibility of getting this Measure before the House of Commons on Friday next week. Members of this Committee who have considered the Architects (Registration) Bill will no doubt agree with me when I say that I do not think it is at all probable that we shall be able to finish the Report stage and Third Reading of the Architects' Bill to-morrow. I give that information to the Committee, because I think we shall be assisting the Bill by hustling it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. BEVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Motion for the Adjournment would have been accepted without a Division. I am astonished at the point of view put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams). We have heard no arguments either from the promoter of the Bill or from the hon. Member which would justify us in accepting
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
the alternative Bill which has been suggested to us. We have been told simply that certain authoritative persons outside the Committee have said that it ought to be accepted, and that the Committee ought to accept their advice without any argument at all. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not care whether they are Welshmen or Scotsmen or Englishmen. I have become as distrustful of Welshmen as of Scotsmen and Englishmen. The Committee are entitled to know from the promoter of the Bill or from the hon. Gentleman what would be the precise effect of the old draft upon a light-work compensation man, and in what way his position will be different under the new draft. We have not been told that either by those opposing the adjournment or those supporting the alternative Clause, and in such circumstances we are being asked to vote in the dark. I am not prepared to delegate my functions as a member of this Committee to any "authoritative person" who is advising the Committee from outside that everything in the garden is lovely; I desire to hear specific arguments in support of the contention. I would direct attention to the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is probable that the workman would, but for the continuing effects of the injury "</p></blockquote>
It appears to me that those words will put the light-work compensation men in a different position under the law. If a man working in a colliery meets with an accident and subsequently partly recovers, and then the colliery closes down—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member is getting a little wide of the question before us. We are now discussing the Adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dealing with that point, because those who have opposed the Adjournment have been arguing the merits of the alternative Clause. I want to show that the apprehensions I feel are justified, and how necessary it is to have an Adjournment in order that we may consider the effect of the alternative Clause, but I bow to your Ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member who has been called to order because he dealt with a specific Amendment instead of with the question of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
Adjournment, will surely recognise that those of us who supported the Adjournment were not in a position to argue the merits of the details of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the whole point to which I have been taking exception—that they have not argued the merits of the change, but have simply conveyed to the Committee the opinion of some persons outside the Committee. If the Committee had been devoting themselves to the merits of the matter I should not have taken any exception. The promoters of the Bill, and those who are opposing the Adjournment, have simply conveyed to us the assurances of certain other people who are not here. I say those who are supporting the alternative Bill should either give us the grounds in support of it, or agree to an Adjournment in order that we may have an opportunity of consulting those persons who appear to possess greater authority than those who are in charge of affairs at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HACKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to oppose the Motion. There is no doubt that the main purpose of this amending Bill was to reverse the decision in Bevan v. Nixon's Navigation Company. Who are the best judges whether that decision is reversed by the terms of this Bill or not? Surely the Law Officers of the Crown. If we cannot accept the opinion of the Law Officers, all I can say to the Government is that it is time they got some fresh Law Officers. We on this side are very anxious to see this Bill placed upon the Statute Book at the earliest possible moment; indeed, I am sure that is the wish of every Member of the Committee. [An HON. MEMBER: "Not the original Bill!"] No, I say "this Bill." Even if it does not go the whole way, it undoubtedly does something, and it does the main thing, in the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, which is to reverse that particular judgment. What will happen if we do not pass the Bill this morning? If the Architects (Registration) Bill does not to-morrow pass its Report stage and Third Reading it will have the prior chance of being put down for the following Friday, and we may never get this Bill; but if we pass the Bill this morning it is at once put down as the first Order for the following Fri-
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
day, and thus we should be absolutely certain of getting it passed into law. On the grounds of expediency, therefore, and of the desire we have to give compensation to those who are not getting it at the present moment, I beg the Committee to resist the Adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRIFFITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the views which have been expressed by the right hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hacking). This is the fourth Bill on this subject which has been before the House. The three others have fallen by the wayside, and if by an Adjournment we choke the chances of this one we shall be taking a very heavy responsibility upon ourselves in delaying compensation to hundreds of injured workmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. EGAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the Chairman whether he can assure the Committee that what we have been told regarding the chances of the Bill being put down on the following Friday is authoritative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I think that what the right hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hacking) has said will happen, is what will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. MACDONALD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am in full sympathy with the complaint of the bon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. A. Bevan) that we have not had a, chance to discuss all that these Amendments may involve, I think he ought to withdraw the Motion for the Adjournment, and take advantage of the opportunity to put down Amendments on the Report stage. We should have a better chance of putting our case on Report stage than we have at the present moment. We should do the best we can to-day, and, if we are not satisfied at the end of to-day's proceedings, then further Amendments can be put down on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TINKER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support that point of view. It may be there are good points in this Bill which we have not yet appreciated. We can raise our points on the Report stage. The objections which have been advanced this morning will give us that opportunity. Had the Bill gone through Committee without any comment at all, we should have been bound to accept it when it came on to the Floor of the House; but now we shall have a chance on the Report stage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
of removing any difficulty which remains. The right hon. Member for Charley (Mr. Hacking) spoke about the Law Officers of the Crown, and said that if they did not know their business—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HACKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say they did not know their business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TINKER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman put it this way—that they were the men to put this thing in order, and we ought to accept their point of view; but we are Members of the House of Commons, and I have got to the stage where I do not intend to follow anybody's lead in these matters. Some of us in the mining industry claim to know perhaps more than the Law Officers of the Crown on this particular point. We are attending the Law Courts daily, and know how the words of Acts of Parliament are construed and twisted, and how men are done out of their compensation. That is why we are not so ready to accept all that somebody else tells us. There may be some good in the amended Clauses, but we cannot accept something because other people have told us to accept it. I hope my hon. Friend will withdraw his Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will realise that I am in a very difficult position. I can assure the Committee that had the Bill reached the Committee in its original state, the attitude of His Majesty's Government would have been quite different from what it is this morning, but as a result of overtures made to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary we have entered into negotiations. We have met the promoters and we have met the Opposition, and we have consulted my hon. Friend the Member for West Middlesbrough (Mr. Griffith), and we have secured what we consider to be the basis of an agreement. There have been four or five drafts. The words which have been circulated to the Members of this Committee are not the words of any hon. and learned Member of this Committee or of any outside person, but the words of our own Parliamentary draftsman, giving effect to what we desired. We had only one desire, and that was to reverse the law as it was left by the judgment in Bevan v. Nixon's Navigation Co. I am assured on the highest authority that these words accom-
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
plish that purpose. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope it may be conceded that there is always room for disagreement as to the meaning of a word or a sentence, especially when one gets into the law courts—I know sufficient law to realise that. I welcome the, I will not say more reasonable, but more friendly attitude which has been taken up on this question of the Adjournment. I suggest that the Committee this morning should accept my Amendments, which embody the complete agreement of all the parties, and if between now and the Report stage my hon. Friends have some other points to raise, and will put them on the Order Paper early, then I will see that on the Report stage, which I hope will be a week on Friday, my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General or, if he is still ill—though I hope he will by then have recovered—the Attorney-General, shall speak with authority upon those points. It is very regrettable that we have not with us the hon. and learned Members for Norwood (Sir W. GreavesLord) and Altrincham (Mr. C. Atkinson), who can speak with authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TINKER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be more trouble then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. No doubt they could remove many doubts which are in the minds of hon. Members. Having regard to the explanations which have been offered, I think we might proceed to accept these Amendments and get the Bill on to the Floor of the House, where any subsequent points can be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the assurance of the hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) As from the passing of this Act the provisions of the sub-section so substituted as aforesaid shall apply in any case where the accident happened on or after the first day of January, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, and an application for weekly payments to be reviewed in accordance with those provisions may be made, notwithstanding that there has not been any change in the condition of the workman or any change of circumstances other than the passing of this Act."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HACKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is not covered by the draft of the amended Clause. I take it that this is in connection with making the Bill retrospective. When the Bill was before the House on Second Reading, it was urged by some Members on my side of the House that it should not be retrospective, but now that it is quite clear that the judgment in the Bevan v. Nixon case, and that judgment only, is to be reversed, and that that is the only effect of the Bill, we agree for the reason that it was the intention of the insurance companies to pay compensation in such cases covered by this Bill, and we think it is reasonable that it should be retrospective so as to cover those cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TINKER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be clear about this. I understood that prior to the Bevan v. Nixon case all cases, whatever the date on which they happened, would come under that judgment. Section 9 (4) of the present Act was a reenactment of Section 16 of the Act of 1925, and I think the Act of 1923 took in all cases prior to 1923. I was hoping that whatever cases occurred before the Bevan v. Nixon case would come in, and I would like an understanding as to whether that point is clear, or does it mean that a straight line is drawn before January, 1924, and that no cases can arise before that time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HACKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This really means that all those cases which were quashed by that particular judgment, and all subsequent cases which were not brought forward, will be able to be re-opened, and that everything will be retrospective in connection with the provisions of this Bill. This is perfectly clear. The date mentioned here is the date of the judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The day on which the Act of 1923 took effect was 1st January. 1924, and the retrospective character of this Bill dates as and from that date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROWSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that if this Sub-section be carried, it means that any case where the accident occurred before the 1st January cannot be taken before the courts. That is what it means as far as I can see. We have to realise that the 1923 Act had certain Sections which applied to cases occuring only after that date, and there were certain Sections which applied to all the cases that occurred before. It seems to me that if this Amendment is agreed to, it will be a limitation of the number of cases that we can bring before the courts under this Bill. For instance you may have a person who had a serious injury after having been working for a long number of years, and was discharged with an amputated leg or arm. The employer will not find him suitable employment, and he is put on a few shillings a week partial compensation, although the accident may have occurred in 1909. He is unemployed to-day, and the employer will not find him work. Surely one ought to be able to bring a case of that description before the courts to-day, and have the partial incapacity treated as total incapacity. There are hundreds of cases of that description. I did not see this Amendment in the original amended draft. If we make any retrospective provision at all, I should like to see it apply to all cases that have occurred since the passing of the 1906 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRIFFITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there will be no great effort to get mere perfection in this retrospective Sub-section, because everybody knows that the most difficult thing in this world in which to get the House of Commons to assist is retrospective legislation. Once you start troubling about that on the Floor of the House on the Report stage, you may find

	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
that you are encountering a good deal of opposition which would not otherwise have been made. It is a great thing to have had the consent which we have received from the right hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hacking) to have the Bill retrospective, and I believe that this Amendment will do everything we really want in this matter. If the provision were not in, there would be workmen who were injured before the decision in the Bevan v. Nixon ease. They would come under a more merciful rule, because the mistake had not been made. There would be another lot of workmen after the passing of the Act, who would also come under the more merciful rule. In between there would be workmen who would be treated in a special way, and the subject of this Amendment is to remove that. It is a great advantage and a notable performance to have got this into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TINKER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this Bill covers cases before the Bevan versus Nixon decision, I am satisfied. My impression was that all the cases, whether they happened prior or not, came within the ruling of the judge, and that he could deal with them on the ground of partial and total
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
incapacity. When the Bill passed Second Reading, no provision was made that it should be retrospective, and it was understood then, according to the Opposition, that it would bring in all cases. All I am asking is that this Bill should put us back exactly where we were before the decision. We will examine it before the Report stage, and, if I am not satisfied, I shall put an Amendment down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
