	<p>Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. There are two matters which I wish to raise. I want to know how many Members of this Committee have been asked to retire since the last meeting, and have they retired voluntarily? I would also like to know how many Members have been appointed to this Committee since our last meeting. I see a number of general Amendments on the Paper, and some of my colleagues and myself have put down certain Amendments. I see at the head of Amendments the name of the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore). I want to know whether that was arranged by the Clerks, or whether the hon. and gallant Member also put down identical Amendments and the names were simply amalgamated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am afraid that I cannot give the hon. Member any information on that point. I am not aware of any change. If any changes have been made, they have been made by the Committee of Selection, and this Committee has no control over that Committee. With regard to the last question which has been put by the hon. Member, I do not quite known to which Amendments he alludes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to all the Amendments where the hon. and gallant Member's name is at the top of the list of names, including my own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think anyone here is responsible, and we do not know how it has occurred. Of course, any hon. Member has a right to put his name to another Amendment, and the way in which it is printed is for the Clerks at the Table to decide. I do not think, however, that either of the two points raised by the hon. Member are points of Order. We have an Amendment before the Committee, and until that has been disposed of, it is the only business at the moment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Committee do now adjourn."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to perturb hon. Members by moving this Motion again, but I do so in order to make a statement as to the position. I understand that that is the correct way to enable me to give an explanation. It will be remembered by the Committee that an two previous occasions we adjourned for informal discussions between the promoters and the critics of the Bill in order to see if we could arrive at an agreed Measure. I am not going through the whole story which I told on the last occasion upon which the Committee met, but I feel that the Committee will want to know what happened at those informal discussions, and they will want an explanation of the Amendments and the names subscribed to them which appear on the Amendment Paper, and to which reference has been made by the hon. Member for Walsall (Mr. McShane).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the last meeting I thought that I was in the happy position of being able to announce that we had come to a substantial measure of agreement, but it was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
decided by the Committee that it might be wiser to adjourn until a final corn-promise or agreement had been arranged on certain minor outstanding questions in regard to representation on the various boards and committees. That was agreed to by the Committee, and we met again informally for these discussions. I want it to be understood that I am now putting before the Committee the view which I gathered from our discussions, and the hon. Member for Walsall will, no doubt, put his view afterwards. After the second meeting the informal committee at which it was understood that we were merely to decide on certain minor questions of representation, an entirely new situation was created by a group of Amendments proposed by the critics of the Bill, which still further fundamentally altered the character of the Bill. All these arrangements were made subject, of course, co confirmation and agreement by this Committee, which, of course, is the deciding factor in any recommendations to which we might come. The arrangement was that the Royal Institute of British Architects should yield up its position as the registration authority under the Bill, and that they agreed to an entirely new independent composite body being created on which they were to secure representation, coupled with all the other achitectural bodies, and to include also representatives of the general body to be nominated by various Government Departments, and representatives of what we may call the frontier professions, such as the engineers, builders and so on. That was agreed to by the Royal Institute of British Architects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would prefer it if the hon. Member would allow me to continue my remarks. The second agreement that we made was that the Admission Committee and the Discipline Committee should be again divorced from any control or supervision by the Council of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and should be handed over as committees of the new body which is' to be termed the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. We also agreed on the revised constitution and composition of these two committees, so as to ensure the widest possible control
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
of architectural registration and of architecture generally by the widest possible number of bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may say in passing that many Members of this Committee had grave doubts as to whether we, as the promoters of the Bill, were right in taking from this ancient body of 100 years' standing these privileges which, in the opinion of many, it had undoubtedly earned, it being an organisation which has drawn within its ranks men of the widest culture, the greatest architectural knowledge, and the widest distinction in the profession, a body which, throughout its 100 years' existence, has built up a system of education, a system of architectural guidance, a system of architectural stimulation, unknown in the world hitherto, and which has opened the gates of architecture to the poorest in the land by a wide and generous system of bursaries and scholarships. Many Members of this Committee have come to me and expressed their view that we were going too far in taking from a body so uniquely equipped the guidance and control of architectural registration; but the point is that we agreed to it, and we felt that, in spite of it, we could make the Bill a workable Bill, and one that would be for the future benefit of architects and of the public generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We met again, as I have explained, to discuss what we considered were the minor questions of representation, and we found that an entirely new group of Amendments, involving an entirely new alteration of the Bill, had been put before us. These were to the effect that this Board of Architectural Education should be handed over as a committee of this new council. As the Committee know, this Board of Architectural Education has been functioning for 25 years. It includes representatives of all the great universities and of all the great architectural schools throughout the country, numbering about 100. It has a visiting board, a teaching board, and an examinations committee; it has contacts with schools of architecture in Australia, South Africa, and all the other Dominions. In other words, it is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ERNEST WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. I am not objecting to a description of the negotiations, but might I suggest to you, Sir Samuel, that the hon. and gallant Member is really
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
arguing the case for a particular instrument which may or may not be put into the Bill later on, and that it is a little outside the range of the description of the negotiations to go into the history or qualifications of this body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a Motion for Adjournment there is no strict rule as to what can or cannot be said. The hon. and gallant Member is in order, and other hon. Members would be in order in answering him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I appeared to offend against the rules in connection with this Motion which I have put forward, but what I wanted to point out, and I am coming to it, was that the new situation which had developed was that we should hand over this great organisation, which has functioned so successfully, which has such a wide representation, and which probably was, and is, unique in the architectural profession throughout the world, to this new body. On that question we split. It was felt that the new situation proposed to be created under the Bill would be unworkable. It was felt that we should be breaking faith with all these great teaching institutions and universities. It was felt that we should be, so to say, standardising architectural education by taking it from this semi-independent body and putting it into the hands of a narrow group of professional architects and outside interests, who would not have the same desire, or knowledge, or ability to deal with the educational problems of architecture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What this Board of Architectural Education has been doing is to stimulate the development of each type of architectural school throughout the country. As hon. Members probably know, each big school has its own features. The Liverpool school has one thing; the Birmingham school has another; the London school has another. They all follow different lines of development—some the Renaissance, some the French school, some the American, and so on. They are all following different line but are all developing, with only one proviso insisted upon, and that is that a general minimum standard of architectural knowledge should be a com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
ponent part of any examination which this Board of Architectural Education agreed to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that question we split. Therefore, on this point, as on all other points, I am putting myself, as I think properly, in the hands of the Committee, for them to decide what is right and proper in dealing with this problem. As regards the Amendments, naturally, or unnaturally—I do not know; that is a matter for the Committee—the critics of the Bill decided, after we had split in our negotiations, that they would reserve to themselves a free hand to oppose or criticise any part of the Bill de 110VO, and that any arrangements that we had made were no longer binding. We did not take that view. We agreed among ourselves, and we explained to the opponents of the Bill, that we would carry on from where we left off in our informal negotiations, and that we would accept all the concessions that we had made. That will, perhaps, explain one point of my hon. Friend's criticism. Yesterday I put dawn the Amendments to give substance to the agreements which we had already made in our informal negotiations. I think that I have explained the whole position as far as I can see it, and I leave the matter in the hands of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, first of all, to thank the Committee for their tolerance of the long delay that has taken place since we originally met to discuss this Bill, and to assure them that during all that time a vast amount of work and study has been put into the matter in order to try to come to an amicable arrangement with the promoters of the Bill. I want to say for the benefit of the Committee that, on the day following the adjournment, my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. E. Winterton) and myself met the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore), and we settled what the agenda was to be in these informal discussions. The first item on the agenda was as to who should be the controlling body; the second was the setting up of admission committees or other committees; the third was the relation of these committees to the controlling body—I want to emphasise that: and the fourth was the question of fees and scholarships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
On the last occasion, although an agreement had been come to that we ought not then to move anything in Committee, an attempt was made to get some Clauses through—I think, if I remember rightly, four. The amazement of some of us at that proposal can be imagined, after it had been understood that nothing was to be done beyond asking the Committee to adjourn again. I want to repeat that the fundamental issues on which the negotiations broke down were these: The first was the question whether or not there should be an independent body. The hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs, I think, suggested that the promoters of al-6 Bill accepted that proposal, but, with the very greatest respect, as I will show in a minute, they did not. The second question was that of the appropriate committees functioning under that body; the third was that of the general conditions of admission to the register; and the fourth and most vital of all, to which I would like to call special attention, was the question whether or not there should be inserted in the Bill another instrument, namely, the Board of Architectural Education, which should have parallel authority with the controlling body, although that seems to 'be a contradiction in terms. This last point was mainly the one on which the negotiations broke down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has not yet been made quite clear that the promoters were prepared to accept an independent controlling body. If it had been, there might not have been any necessity for difficulty or division at all. As to the appropriate committees—the admission committee, the discipline committee, and so on—it would have been perfectly easy to come to an agreement. I admit that, when the conditions of admission are being dealt with by this Committee, and the general conditions governing those who will come in as registered architects, there will be wide divergencies of opinion on the proposals of the promoters of the Bill; but the outstanding feature of all that will emerge from this discussion this morning will be the question whether or not there shall be inserted in a Registration Act an instrument called the Board of Architectural Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I have listened with the utmost amazement to the statement's made by the hon. and gallant Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
for Ayr Burghs. He said that we were taking from this great Board of Architectural Education the powers and so on that it has enjoyed for so many years, and were handing over this great organisation to be incorporated in this Bill. It is precisely because we object to its being in this Bill at all that we are opposing the proposal. We are not taking any powers from this Board of Architectural Education. It exists to-day as a chartered body, and is outside this Bill. We do not want anything to do with it; we do not want it to be inserted here at all, because it is an instrument of the Royal Institute of British Architects. This Board of Architectural Education, which the hon. and gallant Member is insisting should be inserted here, includes 45 Royal Institute of British Architects members, and 15 other members. The promoters of the Bill wish this educational instrument to be inserted in this Bill, which is a Registration Bill, and, once it has received statutory authority, it will mould the whole educational development of architecture in this country. I, as an educationist, object to that; on educational grounds alone I should object to it; but the objections to it are very much more serious than that. In effect, if the designs of the promoters of the Bill were unfortunately to be accepted by this Committee, they would have done, unconsciously, a grave public disservice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point will arise later on certain Amendments, and this Committee, which consists of men of all political parties, whose views on certain fundamental matters clash, will, I am certain, when they understand the real implications of this proposal, have nothing whatever to do with it. I want this Bill to go through as a good Bill. We have given weeks of study and care to the formulation of Amendments which, if accepted, will make it a good Bill from the point of view of architects, from the point of view of the public, from the point of view of the kindred professions, from the point of view of poor children, and also, if I may say so, from the point of view of those craftsmen in the building trade, for whom no provision is being made in the Bill, who may attempt to go forward and become architects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say quite sincerely that I want this Bill to be a good Bill, and I want people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
outside this Committee, and architects in general in the country, to know that the methods which so far are being pursued are not helpful to the promotion of the Bill. In order to convince the Committee how anxious we were to get a settlement we proposed to guarantee a majority of architects on every one of the Committees that would be set up under this Bill; though, most probably, that suggestion would have been taken exception to by this Committee, and, of course, all these negotiations are subject to what this Committee may decide ultimately. We made that proposal quite frankly to test whether they were sincere in their desire for registration, or more sincere in their desire to insert the Board of Architectural Registration as an instrument of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Most thoughtful people would have objected to our proposal, but we deliberately went to that length to test the question whether they were anxious for registration; an d at the end of it all I say now, with deliberation, is that I consider the promoters are not so much anxious for registration per se as anxious to make this an instrument for the promotion of the members of a particular organisation. In my opinion an agreement could have been come to which would have helped a great profession, and I am profoundly disappointed to find that no real attempt was made to meet us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will members of the Committee get it clearly into their minds that we are not trying to take away from the powers of the Board of Architectural Education, which is not in this Bill—yet—which is a chartered body outside, but which the promoters of the Bill desire to have included? As a registered teacher myself, I want to see the members of another profession registered, I want to see them have the opportunities and facilities which I have claimed for myself; but the manner in which this Bill has been pushed in this House has not been helpful to architects, for many of whom I am speaking this morning. I hope the Committee will believe that if the Amendments we propose were accepted the Bill would be a credit to this Committee and would operate for the public weal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Originally I was opposed to this Bill, because I thought it was fundamental that there ought to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
be an independent registration body. I believe that concession has now been granted, and my main objection to the Bill is removed. At the same time, I can accept neither the arguments put forward by Colonel Moore in favour of the Royal Institute of British Architects nor those of Mr. McShane against, because it is ridiculous to claim that the Royal Institute of British Architects contains all the greatest architects of England and is far superior to any other architectural body in the world. It is well known that Sir Edwin Lutyens, the greatest living architect, is not a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was never elected president, though a number of extremely second-rate architects were promoted to that august office. At the same time it is wrong for Mr. McShane—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member kindly refer to other Members of the Committee by their constituencies instead of by their names?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Walsall (Mr. McShane) is wrong in ascribing some deep, Machiavellian motive to the Royal Institute of British Architects. The insertion of an educational controlling body seems to me the most attractive thing in the Bill and appears to me to be the only argument for it; because I do not believe this Bill will do a great deal for architecture, and certainly will not do anything to elevate aesthetic standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were prepared to make provision for a representative committee for the furtherance of architectural education. The point of difference is whether or not this outside body shall be inserted and shall come under the control of the ultimate instrument of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is rather splitting hairs there. Already there is in existence a ready-made educational body, which anyone can accept as reasonably competent to discharge the functions which would be conferred upon it. All the Bill will do is to ensure that reasonable competence in architecture is required of members of the profession. It can do very little else. If we have to argue about whether the Royal Institute of British Architects will have too many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
influential members on a committee of this sort, it seems we shall argue for ever as to who are the most competent persons to sit on the committee, and whether the Institute has too many representatives or some other architectural association has too many representatives. It would be a great pity to kill the Bill simply because we disagree on a number of very small points. The hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore) and his associates have shown great reasonableness in accepting various suggestions which we have put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is killed it will be quite impossible, in my opinion, to bring forward another which will satisfy the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Walsall and those Members of the Committee who support him. They really want something perfect, but we cannot get something perfect in registering any trade. The hon. Member referred to the Teachers Registration Council. There are quite a number of educationists who think that body is not, on the whole, discharging the functions which its original promoters expected of it. Equally, if this Bill be passed, I do not think it will satisfy the whole of the architectural profession, but it will do something. I believe that in Manchester several thousand houses have been built without the supervision of architects; and, in my own villiage in the country, until recent times an undertaker called himself an architect and was quite prepared to carry out any architectural commissions given to him. Some minimum standard ought to be expected from architects, and this Bill would give it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs has shown so much reasonableness I appeal to hon. Members to support the Bill. There are thousands of students working in architectural schools in Liverpool, London and other parts of the country. I have consulted the heads of two of these institutions. Professor Riley, who is one of the most reasonable and able architectural authorities in England, and has done a great deal to promote architectural education, and is not, as people might expect a great protagonist for the Royal Institute of British Architects, strongly recommends this Bill, on the grounds that it will give his students a professional status, give them
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
the knowledge that there is a career opening before them, and that they will not have to compete with a plumber or a grocer or a butcher who may care to call himself an architect. If we reject this Bill on the slender grounds put forward we shall incur, I will not say the contempt, but certainly the censure, of every architectural student, and we shall have done a great deal to encourage quack architects to organise opposition to a Bill such as this and to continue to use the name of a great profession for all sorts and conditions of trades and callings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the hon. Member for Walsall to be a little more accommodating and to give this Bill his support. I attach no great importance to the effect of the Bill on the aesthetic standards of the country, nor do I think it will fulfil all the high hopes held out by the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs, but a great deal of time and attention has been given to it, and while I am attracted by some of the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Walsall I am bound, in fairness, to say that the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs has met the objections I put to him with extraordinary consideration. I feel he has been extremely accommodating towards the hon. Member for Walsall, who is adopting a stern, Cromwellian attitude, which is not at all helpful in transacting business. If this Bill is rejected the quacks to which I have referred will continue, and we shall have done a great disservice to the younger students who are coming into this profession and who find it difficult enough to gain a livelihood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir NEWTON MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my hope that the opponents of this Bill will to some extent modify their requests? It seems to me that every reasonable concession that has been asked for will be granted. I speak as one who has some knowledge of the profession, as for many years I was president of the Surveyors' Institute. I recall that when this same question was before us in Australia we realised that it was impossible to create a perfect body. We recognised that men already in practice had to be registered in its early years, but we realised that the objects of the Institute would be achieved after a few years. At the beginning one would probably have to register men who are dud architects but who have been practising, and whom the people of the country have been satisfied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
to employ; but eventually one could create an improved standard, so that when a man became a registered architect it would be a ticket worth having, recognised not only in this country but of value to him overseas, giving him a standing which he otherwise could not have. How have things developed in connection with the Surveyors' Institute in Australia? First of all original members were ordinary surveyors, but the standard was improved; railway engineering was included, so that a licensed surveyor could lay out a railway and would know all about earth work, etc., and he also had to have a knowledge of geology, be able to obtain the true meridian, etc. When surveyors were first admitted not one of them could perform any of these services. One must make a start.

I know Sir Edwin Lutyens, and in coming across the Atlantic recently I talked this matter over with him. He did not agree with me, and said there were such a lot of poorly qualified people in that it would not be worth while, but I used to him the same arguments as I am using now. I said it would be necessary gradually to build up the standard over a period of years, insisting, perhaps, that a man should have served his articles to an architect over a period of years, or put a provision in which was suggested by one of the speakers who spoke of the advantage of including in this registration clerks of works and men. After a few years you will thus improve the standard. It will not interfere with the registration of men who are competent. The House of Commons affirmed the principle that it is desirable. We do not want, over some pettifogging little Amendment, to throw this Bill out and waste valuable time. We are here to give effect to the wishes of the House of Commons. I believe the Committee are anxious to meet the objections. I hope we shall proceed and recognise that it is impossible to create a perfect body. That cannot be done before a certain period has elapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be misleading to suggest that the promoters have not gone some distance in endeavouring to meet the critics of the Bill. I frankly acknowledge that they have, but I am afraid they have done it under duress. They saw the red light at the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
last meeting and realised that, unless they made a concession as regards the controlling board, the Bill was lost. I do not, therefore, attach too great importance to the fact that they have made concessions, as they interpreted the feeling of the Committee. The hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken), I think, was not present. If he had been present at previous meetings, he would not have taken up the position that he has to-day. It is very pleasing to find him in this rather curious position of mediator between two very opposing points of view. I should rather have expected to find him a full-blooded supporter either of the hon. and gallant Gentleman or of the critics of the Bill. I congratulate him on the sweet reasonableness that he is developing, and we shall look forward to an extension of it on the Floor of the Chamber in future discussions.

We have broken down on the question mainly, though not entirely, of the Board of Architectural Education. It was suggested by the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore) that there were some Members of the Committee who had very grave doubts as to taking away the rights of this long-established board. There is nothing whatever in any Amendment on the Paper which takes away any rights of the Board of Architectural Education—not a sentence or a comma. We are saying that there has been, under the direct control of one particular architectural organisation, the Royal Institute of British Architects, an examining instrument which they have used in various ways, partly to get architectural classes in polytechnics and evening classes and other centres. This is not even an association. It is a club of students and of architects who are mainly, if not entirely, members of the Royal Institute of British Araiitects, and we object to bringing this outside instrument into a Bill of this character and giving it statutory authority, in the same way that we should object to any other outside body altogether unconnected with the main purposes of a registration Bill being put into this Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that there ought to be some proof that this is really an instrument of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Turn to the calendar of the

institute as regards the examinations committee and all the members of the visiting board who visit the schools where the members of the institute are teachers. Everyone without any exception is a member of the institute. The hon. Member for North Paddington suggested that we should not regard the institute as having any Machiavellian purpose. There is a verse in the Scripture that says, "By their fruits ye shall know them," and, judging by the fact that you have practically a parallel body dominated, manipulated and controlled in the interests of the institute, which the promoters desire to put into a paramount position, I think we are justified in asking whether it would be in the general interest of the community to give this privileged place to an institute of this kind. In other words, it is not that we are desirous of taking away any power or privilege, or work or operation at present discharged by this' Board of Architectural Education. All that we object to is giving it new privileges not at present enjoyed, and putting it in a position of predominance over any other body of an examining character which ought to enjoy equal privileges.

Why has agreement not been come to? The reason is that the critics of the Bill went into these negotiations without any particular preconceived idea except that we desired to shape the Bill in the public interest. If I read the mind of the hon. and gallant Gentleman who is promoting it, both as regards his speeches and his general attitude, I cannot come to any other conclusion than that the institute has tied him up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interpreting the hon. and gallant Gentleman's speeches and his attitude. It has tied him up so that this will not be regarded as a desirable Bill for the registration of architects' unless this peculiar instrument of the Royal Institute of British Architects becomes an inherent and an incorporated part of it. That is why the negotiations have broken down, not because of any unreasonableness on this side, but because of the absolutely intransigent attitude of the promoters. I am going to prove that in the course of the Debates if it is' desirable to do so.

We, like the hon. Member for North Paddington, are desirous of seeing a good registration Bill. The hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Richmond (Sir N. Moore) said it was impossible to create a perfect body. I agree. This will not be a perfect Bill even with the Amendments that we have striven to get the other people to accept. If the Committee were to accept all the Amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Walsall (Mr. McShane) and others, it would still not be a perfect Bill. It would not satisfy the meticulous requirements of holding together and being a perfectly water-tight Bill. We have not insisted on that. I agree that there is nothing perfect in this world but, when we are asked to make a start, the question that we have to ask ourselves is, to start on what road? Are we starting on a road which would lead to the normal and natural development and improvement of the architectural profession by a registration Bill which is designed to produce that result? Our view is that we are starting on the wrong road. We are injuring the prospects of architecture, we are not meeting the wishes of a great many architects, and we are doing a disservice to architecture if we embark along the path on which the hon. and gallant Gentleman is asking us to embark. We desire to see adequate and effective registration of architects. We are taking up a position which we ask the Committee to believe is in the public interest, without favour to any particular profession or association, and we ask the Committee to support us in the Amendments that we hope to make later in the Bill in order that that result may be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment simply brings into being the committee to which reference has already been made. The new council is naturally the supreme body in regard to registration, admission and discipline. For the purpose of admitting applicants to the register, this Admission Committee will be set up by the council under the Bill. The Admission Commitee will function for a period of, probably, five years, during which time any practising architect or architectural student can make application to the council. That is clear according to the part of the Clause which we have already passed. Then, the applicant having made application and paid the necessary fee, the question of admitting him will be placed in the hands of the Admission Committee set up by the council. The Admission Committee will decide, according to the qualifications, whether the applicant is a suitable person to come on the register, and, if they decide that he is, the applicant will be placed on the register on the authority of the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the hon. and gallant Member can tell us what exactly he means by the expression "	<i>bond fide architect.</i>" That is rather an important point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to explain this matter technically, but my experience, and no doubt the experience of other members of the Committee, is that everyone in a town knows who is a 	<i>bonâ fide</i> architect. He is one the majority of whose professional work is architectural. That is as far as one can give a definition. The idea, however, of laying down, first, a period of five years during which application may be made, and, secondly, of making a wide gate by which so many are allowed to enter, is to ensure that no harm is done to and no work taken away from any person who is deriving his livelihood from the "majority" practice of architecture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain RONALD HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. and gallant Friend is rather labouring under a misapprehension. The Amendment proposes to include:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
	<br><q><p>"Every person who makes application within five years of the passing of this Act who is or has been in 	<i>bonâ fide</i> practice as an architect or is qualified to practise as an architect."</p></q>
That is to say, it will include anybody who, irrespective of qualifications, or lack of qualifications, has been practising. It may be that a decorator, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken), would be entitled to apply to the Board for registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not seem to me that the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore) has explained anything. Explanations of explanations do not amount to anything. In the first place, my hon. and gallant Friend says that everyone in a town knows who is an architect, but that is really a most absurd argument, if it means that you will have to go round the town and ask who is to be considered an architect. As regards the remark of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Henley (Captain R. Henderson), he will see that the important words are "	<i>bonâ fide</i> practice." How is it to be possible, on the standard laid down by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs, for anyone to say who is a 	<i>bonâ fide</i> architect? That is a most ludicrous provision. It will rule out a great number of distinguished architects who might not be regarded as being in 	<i>bonâ fide</i> architectural practice. Architecture is a very large subject. It covers decoration and many other things. If I may give an instance, Mr. Robert Lutyens, the son of Sir Edwin Lutyens, is one of the best modern de curators in London, but he might find it difficult to maintain that he was in 	<i>bonâ fide</i> architectural practice. I hope that this provision will be made much more clear. It is no use asking this Committee to pass it and trust to the Council, because a number of people might get together and say they did not like these decorators taking the bread out of the mouths of registered architects, and they would not have them on the register. The term "	<i>bonâ fide</i> practice "is much too vague and shadowy, and, if it is not made more clear, I shall certainly vote against the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat surprised that the Committee, so far, does
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
not seem to have noticed the significance of this Amendment. This is one of the fundamental parts of the Bill, and the Amendment, if it were passed in the form suggested, would have an effect that this Committee in later years would not care to contemplate. I am glad that the hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken) seized upon the point as to what is a 	<i>bonâ fide</i> architect. There are to-day numbers of architectural societies some of whom recruit as actual members, and presumably as architects who would come on to the register under this Bill, people who, as a matter of fact, are not architects at a11. There is a sort of conglomeration of people with qualifications varying from nothing up to very nearly perfection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this Committee, after the relatively long discussion that we have had this morning, will not accept this Amendment. It proposes to set up an examination committee, but I want to warn this Committee that it is proposed that that examination committee shall be under the control and influence of the Board of Architectural Education which is set up in an amended Schedule. They will have the sole and exclusive right of admitting to the register, and they also will have control of the examinations, and will narrow down and mould nearer to their heart's desire, as Omar Khayyam says, exactly the type of persons whom they want to get in; and since it is an instrument of the Royal Institute of British Architects, it is obvious, without my going into detail, what the effect will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a, proposal which affects very seriously the future interests of the building trades, and, if the Amendment were to be accepted, there would be very little hope of a craftsman who was really anxious later on to become an architect being able to go through the building trade to the architectural status that he desires. I would suggest that it would be well that this Committee should do one of two things—that they should either reject the whole Amendment this morning, or alternatively, that they should consider its amendment in view of its remarkable implications, which I am bound to say I myself have not had time this morning to study, and which I am certain members of this Committee have not had time to study. If it be passed as

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
it is, it will hall-mark for all time the qualifications necessary for future entrants. I hope that the Committee will reject the Amendment in its present form, and will consider our proposals, which would make much more general provision and would allow the council to make certain regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, for instance, paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of the Amendment, which would include architect members of the Royal Academy and the Royal Scottish Academy on the register; but we cannot accept, as it stands, paragraph (	<i>b</i>). We suggest, as an alternative to this, the words:
	<br><q><p>"Every person who has gained Or gains in architecture a degree or diploma recognised by the Council as qualifying for registration."</p></q>
These words mean, by implication, that the Council will make its own regulations. I do not think it is desirable that we should begin to delimit in the fullest detail exactly what qualifications may be necessary for future entrants into the architect's profession. Another Amendment that we would suggest would be the insertion of the words:
	<br><q><p>"Every person who makes application within six months"—</p></q>
rather than five years—
	<br><q><p>"of the passing of this Act who is or has been in 	<i>bonâ fide</i> practice as an architect or is qualified to practise as an architect."</p></q>

There is no provision here as to who is going to decide as to this qualification. I can imagine that, if certain people had the opportunity of saying who was to be regarded as qualified to practise as an architect, they would restrict it very greatly, and would prevent the admission of a number of people who at the present time may be engaged in the work of an architect. I cannot understand why the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore) is pressing for this restrictive provision. Surely, there is no intention on his part—at least, I hope not—to exclude the man who is possessed of genius. I do not say that the one referred to by the hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken) is possessed of genius, but there are many in that position, and I am afraid that these restrictions may prevent us from having the advantage of the ability and capacity of someone when it would be of advantage to the industry and the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think the Committee are in some difficulty, because it is only this morning that we have seen the Amendment which has been moved by the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore). We have prepared alternative Amendments to this Amendment, and we desire that the Committee should consider them; and I think it would be only fair to the Committee if we were now to adjourn, in order that our Amendments may be put on the Paper and may be judged in relation to the hon. and gallant Member's proposals. I presume that he will raise no objection to that course being pursued. May I say that in our view there is here an attempt to stereotype for all time the qualifications in connection with the profession of architecture, and our object and desire is, so far as possible, to leave that question in a position of flux and of possible development in the future. Our alternative Amendments are designed to make provisions of a far more general kind, meeting the points which have been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Mr. Kelly) and by the hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken). Therefore, I am hopeful that the Committee will be willing to adjourn now, in order that, When we meet again, we may consider with fresh minds not only the implications of the Amendments which are now being brought forward by the hon. and gallant Member who is the chief promoter of the Bill, but also the alternative Amendments which we have prepared. If, on the other hand, the Committee is prepared to sit on, I am prepared to move my Amendments as

manuscript Amendments to the Amendment which is now being considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TINKER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not adjourn, but will either get on with the Bill or end it one way or the other. It seems to me to be playing with the whole matter that we should meet at eleven, sit for an hour and a-half, and then adjourn in order that we may consider the matter with fresh minds. That is all that we have been doing during the 10 or 11 hours that we have been considering this Bill. If we cannot make up our minds what we have to do, let us keep away altogether. Therefore, I suggest that the Committee should not adjourn now, but should get on with the Bill and see whether we can finish it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WILLIAM STEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker). This is a difficult Bill, and it is better that we should adjourn, in order that we may have clear minds as to what we are doing. We cannot digest these changes this morning. There is the question which was raised about any man qualified to practise as an architect. Who is to judge of that? We must know what is the inference there. I am qualified to practise, being an architect, but I should not be admitted, because I belong to the building trade. Is a boy, because his father is a builder, or because he learns that trade, to be excluded simply because he is a member of the trade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is getting back to the Amendment. The question before us is a Motion for the Adjournment, and we must keep to the question of whether to adjourn in order to be able to see the Amendments on the Order Paper or to continue now and deal with them as manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Adjournment for the reason that we cannot find out what they mean unless we have an opportunity to think them out. I want to see the Bill go through, but I want it to be a satisfactory Bill, and we ought to try to come to an agreement. There are architects in my constituency who ask me to oppose the Bill and others who say they do not oppose it, and so I urge the Committee to adjourn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is an extraordinary proposal to ask us to adjourn in order that we may have clear minds. If it is suggested that our minds are bewildered after an hour-and-a-half's work, any architect or, anybody else interested in the Bill, will feel, if. we do adjourn, that the House of Commons is worthy of all the contempt which has been poured upon it of late. Hard working professional people come here with difficulty and at expense to themselves and lay proposals before us, and hon. Members get up and solemnly say that after an hour-and-a-half's work their minds are not clear. It is absolutely ridiculous! It is trifling with the promoters of the Bill, and with the public. Another argument put forward in favour of adjourning is that the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Winterton) tells us he has much better Amendments, and that we ought to consider them; that we ought to wait until to-morrow to have the pleasure of reading them in print. It is monstrous to waste the time of the Committee in this way! People come here who have other work to do, who, like most of us, have to earn their livelihood, and the Committee are trifled with and obstructed by hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Loughborough and the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Stewart), whose physical frailty prevents him from doing an hour-and-a-half of concentrated work. I say this is a monstrous proposal, and I hope the Press will take considerable notice of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LINDLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to support the Motion for the Adjournment. Only a little while ago the hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken) was referring to qualified architects and those who might be known as quack architects, and I want to know precisely where we are. We ought to have a clear understanding of the purport of the Amendments. The hon. Member for North Paddington may understand the whole of the Amendments, but we do not all possess the wisdom of the gods. I feel strongly upon this matter, representing the interests of people who are thoroughly well qualified and have graduated to the profession of architects, but have never been admitted as members of the Royal Institute of British Architects. We have members of the Royal Institute of British Architects who are neither more nor less than land

They get hold of a site; they get hold of a builder; they exploit the builder and they exploit the builder's credit; and they even exploit some of the legal men whom they get hold of, because they are more astute than Members of this Committee, wise as the latter may think themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Is it in order to go into this question on the Adjournment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just rising to draw the attention of the hon. Member to the fact that it is the question of the Adjournment that is before us. I asked the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Stewart), not to argue the Amendment on this Motion for the Adjournment. We must keep to the point of whether we should adjourn now or in 25 minutes' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LINDLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I have transgressed, but I think we should adjourn, in order to give every Member of the Committee an opportunity of considering the Amendments and ascertaining how far-reaching or otherwise they may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHAKESPEARE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly oppose this Motion for the Adjournment, and I am glad to see the hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken) getting back to his old bellicose form. It is disgraceful that we should keep on adjourning and adjourning. The Committee has been appointed to consider this Bill, and surely we are intelligent enough to decide a Clause on its merits, without all these hole-and-corner methods. If they are persisted in, I shall begin to suspect something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I be permitted to withdraw the Motion for the Adjournment I am not sure whose fault it is that they were overlooked, but the Amendments to which I have referred are already on the Order Paper, on page 734, and I am somewhat surprised that the clear mind of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>), and to insert instead thereof a new paragraph:
	<br><q><p>"(	<i>b</i>) Every person who has gained or gains in architecture a degree or diploma recognised by the Council as qualifying for registration."</p></q>
I thank you, Sir Samuel, for the guidance you have given us. We were in a difficulty, because the Amendment had for some reason got a long way from the original Clause. The Clause, with the Amendments suggested, is designed to stereotype in one particular form, and also under the aegis of the Board of Architectural Education, what the qualifications for an architect shall be. We object to the introduction of this body at all as a controlling authority, or as an examining authority, unless it be under the control of the Council itself. If the Council say "We will give to the Board of Architectural Education the work of examining students" we have no objection. They may decide that, or may decide to ask some other examining body to do the work, but we object to the House of Commons saying that this particular body shall be incorporated in the Bill as the body which is to carry out this very responsible work. We therefore desire to keep in the words "the architect members of the Royal Academy and the Royal Scottish Academy" who, of course, would naturally be accepted. Nobody would quarrel with a diploma from bodies so responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member says a diploma from the Royal Academy and the Royal Scottish Academy, what does he mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A qualification in architecture which is indicated in the first part of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have passed that. We have got to paragraph (	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our wording is very much better, because it is wider in scope and does not tie down the council to any particular examining authority, and it allows from time to time variations, as architecture progresses, in the terms of qualification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member will excuse me for using
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
strong language in regard to this Amendment, but it is a monstrous suggestion. If you were to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>), it would mean that we should throw over the universities and anyone that had gained a diploma at them. All the work that those great universities have been doing and devoting their educational facilities to would be washed out, and there would be nothing to replace them except the possibility that the council might see fit to agree with them. There have been agreements made in building up the system of architectural education with these great universities and teaching schools. At one sweep you would be throwing them out of existence. That is as regards the universities. The Architectural Association of London is the second biggest body engaged in architecture in the world. It has a membership of over 2,000, it has a very old history and it has established a standard of architectural education which it would be a positive crime now to disregard. We have included "or from any other body approved by the council," which is part of the wording of the new Amendment, and we have brought in this body that I have referred to. The Architectural Board of Education has such wide experience that it is the one body adequate to recommend to the council what standards of examination should be accepted. I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. M. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appeal to the hon. and gallant Gentleman not to press his argument to a contentious degree. The Amendment does not define exactly what the qualifications are going to be, but, nevertheless, it gives scope for the inclusion of the very bodies that he has inserted in his Amendment at the discretion of the council. That is surely giving more latitude and, should there be other recognised bodies in future, they can also be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. and gallant Friend that his is a better Amendment in every respect. It is based upon the argument that this is much too narrow a body to decide upon architectural qualifications. All the universities have architectural schools, North, South, East and West. The Architectural Association is the broadest possible educational body that could be composed in any profession in the world, and a much broader body than the medical and legal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
profession will accept. This is a wrecking Amendment brought in in order to smash up my hon. and gallant Friend's very carefully drawn Clause. It would be open to a young man to go to a university to work for four years and get an architectural degree, and he would not be at all certain that he would be admitted by the council. I cannot understand the extraordinary snobbery of rejecting the sweeping away of the schools mentioned in this paragraph while accepting paragraph (	<i>a</i>), which consists of a few eminent individuals', sometimes not the greatest architects, who are often in no way as capable as members of the Royal Institute of British Architects. It is extraordinary snobbery to let a man in because he is a Royal Academic but to obstruct the young student in the schools. That is good Socialist argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to express my resentment at the charge made by the hon. Member that we are attempting to wreck this Bill. I know infinitely more about the Bill and all its implications than he does. His speech gives positive proof that he knows literally nothing at all about the implications of this paragraph. No one takes any exception to the first part of it. One of the first regulations would be that the degrees and diplomas of universities and colleges of proper standing would be recognised. It is a source of amusement to me that the hon. Member slipped the words, "Or from the Architectural Association (London)." That is not, strictly speaking, a, college or an educational body but a club consisting of students, and those who frequent it are no more comparable with the universities in respect of getting diplomas than the hon. Member would be in relation to knowledge of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRACKEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Is the hon. Member entitled to make entirely inaccurate statements? The Architectural Association of London is one of the foremost architectural education bodies in the country. I protest against the hon. Member's offensiveness and ignorance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a, point of Order, but a point of contradiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Sir Samuel, for the rebuke that you have given to the lion. Member. To put this club on the same level with the great universities is to make these proposals
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
ridiculous. But there is a further point. The Board of Architectural Education, which is dominated entirely by the Royal Institute of British Architects, is presumably to be allowed to slip through, giving them the statutory authority which they want. We propose something much more reasonable. We shall certainly not propose to delimit in detail what qualifications shall be recognised by this party. If this is passed, you are in effect stereotyping for all time what the qualifications shall be in regard to that. You are giving no discretion. You are imposing upon the Council a restrictive form. Is it not conceivable that a university, or this club, the Architectural Association, might have in future a low standard of qualification? Yet, however low it is, you are insisting that the Council shall recognise it. That is a most dangerous suggestion. In other Amendments we propose that the Council shall make regulations as to recognising this body or that. I beg the Committee under no circumstances to accept this but to accept our Amendment, which leaves more latitude to the Council. The Council that we propose will consist of architects, representatives of the public, representatives of the builders and operatives and employés, representatives of universities, who will see that their standard of attainments is duly recognised, and representatives of the kindred professions. A Council so represented would not act in a way contrary to any of the interests that it represented. Do not let the Committee insist that the Council shall have its hands tied, remembering that it represents all the great interests that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BROAD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we could make very rapid progress, for all that the hon. and gallant Gentleman wants is contained in the Amendment. He has confidence in the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in regard to education so much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BROAD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has confidence that the Council is to be composed of people of responsibility who will be guided by those who have a better knowledge of education. The hon. and gallant Gentleman specifies certain bodies, universities and so on, and a particular Institute. When you begin to schedule bodies, you may have your differences of opinion.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
He also says other bodies may be recognised by the Council. But he puts in a statutory qualification, "on the recommendation of the Board of Architectural Education," and that is where the difference comes in. Does he not think that, even if the Board of Education is not given a statutory position, it will still be in existence, and a Council of this character would undoubtedly consider favourably any recommendation from that educational beard? So that he has all that he wants. The Council could not ignore the universities and would in all probability recognise the Institute and would think very seriously before it threw on one side any recommendation from the Educational Board of the Royal Institute. We might easily make progress if he would only accept these few words. He has lost nothing. All these bodies can be included, and any further bodies can be included on the decision of the Council, which would undoubtedly very seriously consider any recommendation by the Board. Let us make progress or, if we go on for too many days, we shall find no quorum to carry on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LINDLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Committee to recognise precisely what is suggested under the Amendment of the hon. Gentleman. Is it not true that this Board is merely the instrument of a vested interest? With all respect to the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs, I would like to say that some of us have had just as much experience in these matters as he himself has had. The objective of this Measure seems to me to be to secure and maintain the vested interests of particular organisations. If the hon. and gallant Member who is responsible for the promotion of this Measure really wishes to remove our objections to it, I submit most respectfully that he should accept our Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHAKESPEARE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This stereotyped form of words would, I think, prevent what the promoters desire to achieve. What does the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Lieut.-Colonel Moore) lose by accepting the Amendment to his Amendment? I see no point in stereotyping the kind of association, university, or institution that can enable a man to get a degree which qualifies him for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
registration. I would much prefer the Amendment of the hon. Member for Walsall (Mr. McShane). There are, or there were in my time, at the university a large number of girl students who, although they passed the same degree, were not entitled to receive it. In other words, they might pass the same examination as a man, and the man would get a degree and the girl would not. Under the Amendment that is provided for, because, obviously, in the case of a woman architect they would say that the passing of the examination by a Girton girl, although she had not got a degree, would be the same as a man at Trinity College who had got a degree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a number of misconceptions in regard to this Amendment. I would like hon. Members to refer to the First Schedule which gives the composition of the Board of Architectural Education. It says:
	<br><q><p>"The Headmasters' Conference.
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>The Incorporated Association of Headmasters.</li>
	<li>The Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants.</li>
	<li>The Education Officer of the London County Council.</li>
	<li>The Workers Educational Association."</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></q>
There are also a number of educational associations and institutions which are in no way concerned with the Royal Institute of British Architects as an institute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LINDLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Royal Institute of British Architects have a dominating voting power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will not be the effect if the Amendments on the Paper are accepted, because they will give a wider basis of representation to the board. Many hon. Members have talked about the Royal Institute of British Architects having so much influence on this board, but they cannot help drawing to themselves the thousands of architects who want to associate themselves with this culture. Why should we deny that power to them because a majority of architects wish to be associated with this body? Any hon. Member who looks at the Schedule will see at once that this Measure is not an instrument of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of my Amendment provides that

	<br><q><p>"Every person who has gained or gains a degree or diploma in architecture from any university in Great Britain or Northern Ireland—"</p></q>
If you alter the phraseology to that which has been suggested by the hon. Member for Walsall, it will then mean that any person who ha-s gained or gains a degree, and who has worked for years to obtain that degree may be deprived of the benefits of that degree at the whim of the Council. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] That is quite true, and all the suggestions which have been made by the Committee have been suppositious. It has been said that the Council will do this and that, but may I point out that the Council is not an education body and it comprises all sorts and con-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
