	<div class='page-header'><h1>ARCHITECTS (REGISTRATION) BILL</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 7.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>â€”(Removal of name from Register.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>(1) If any person registered under the provisions of this Act shall be convicted of felony or misdemeanour, or after an inquiry held as hereinafter provided be judged by the Discipline Committee, hereinafter in this section mentioned, to have been guilty of any conduct disgraceful to him in a professional respect, the Council shall, if the Discipline Committee so request, cause the name of such person to be removed from the Register, either permanently or for such period as the Discipline Committee think fit.</p>
	<p>(2) For the purpose of holding any inquiry under this section as to whether any person registered under this Act has been guilty of any conduct disgraceful to him in a professional respect and at which inquiry such person shall be entitled to be heard, there shall be appointed annually a committee to be called "the Discipline Committee" consisting of eight members, three members being persons registered under this Act to be appointed by the Council, one member appointed by the Commissioners of His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings, one member appointed by the Minister of Health, one member appointed by the President for the time being of the Law Society, one member appointed by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, and one member appointed by the Ulster Society of Architects (Incorporated), and the Council shall convene a meeting of the Discipline Committee from time to time whenever necessary to hold any such inquiry.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MOORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), to leave out the words "person registered under the provisions of this Act," and to insert instead thereof the words "registered person."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is simply a drafting Amendment in accordance with the advice of the Home Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P1I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), after the word "misdemeanour," to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the council may upon proof of such conviction cause the name of such person to be removed from the Register either temporarily or permanently, as the council determines."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this Amendment is to try to ensure what the critics of the Bill have been attempting throughout the whole course of the proceedings on this Bill to ensure, namely, that the council under this Bill shall be the controlling authority. The Amendment, therefore, raises again the old question as to whether it shall be a standing committee set up under the Bill, or whether it shall be the council, that is in control. This, indeed, is a case parallel to what has already happened under Sub-section (1) of Clause 5, to which I refer for a moment merely for purposes of illustration. Sub-section (1) of Clause 5 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following persons shall, on making application to the council and on payment of the prescribed fee without any other qualification being required under this Act, be entitled to be registered, and the council shall cause their names to be entered in the Register."</p></blockquote>
That is to say, the statutory Admission Committee is to settle whether a person is to come on to the register or not, and then it says that the council, which is supposed to be the dominating authority, shall recognise it willy-nilly. In the present Clause as it stands we have an exactly similar thing. Sub-section (1) of Clause 7 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any person registered under the provisions of this Act shall be convicted of felony or misdemeanour, or after an inquiry held as hereinafter provided be judged by the Discipline Committee, hereinafter in this section mentioned, to have been guilty of any conduct disgraceful to him in a professional respect, the council shall, if the Discipline Committee so request, cause the name of such person to be removed from the Register, either permanently or for such period as the Discipline Committee think fit."</p></blockquote>
I do not know that the promoters of this Bill should have worried in the least even about the original fight as to whether there should be a council or not. I think it would have been wise for them to have conceded to us that point at the outset, because, if they have got the Admission Committee, which is to tell the
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
council what to do, and if they have got this Discipline Committee, which is also going to order the council what to do, the council, by the time this Bill has been finished with in this Committee, will become a perfect Gilbert and Sullivan council. I do not know whether it will be necessary for it ever to meet, since all that it has to do is to register the instructions issued to it by the statutory committees, the Admission Committee and the Discipline Committee. Therefore, what we are proposing by this Amendment is to insist that the council shall be the authority that is to determine whether a man is or is not to be removed from the register, and, as I shall show in a moment, there will be grave reason for that. Sub-section (1) of Clause 7 refers to the Discipline Committee. The promoters of this Bill, luckily for us, have Issued an analysis of the proposed Discipline Committee. I have in my hand their proposals, and I will read exactly what they say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee, as proposed by Lieut.-Colonel Moore, is to consist of:</p></blockquote>
	<table class='table table-striped'>
	<tr>
	<td>Member nominated by the Commissioners of Works</td>
	<td>1</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Member nominated by the Minister of Health</td>
	<td>1</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Members nominated by the President of the Law Society</td>
	<td>2</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Members (From the Register) appointed by the council</td>
	<td>4</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>8</td>
</tr>
</table>
	<br><blockquote><p>N.B.â€”In addition to the above permanent members, two temporary members may be appointed under (3) and (4)."</p></blockquote>
The result of that would be that, according to the Discipline Committee actually proposed, there would be in the hands of the Royal Institute of British Architectsâ€”King Charles's headâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HARRIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sick of hearing attacks on the Royal Institute of British Architects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making attacks on the Royal Institute of British Architects as such. I think that as a trade union it has a perfect right to protect its own members' interests, and I, as a Socialist, would be the first to say that. But I object to it using me to get itself incorporated statutorily in a Bill later on, if its hopes are realised, which I am positive they will not be now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord ERSKINE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the Miners' Federation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McSHANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind that interjection as long as hon. Members will agree that the Miners' Federation shall get the same syndicalistic powers as are proposed in this Bill. But, if such a thing were proposed, I can imagine the cries that would come from Conservative Members about this being red ruin and a breaking up of laws. When trade unionists are going to be given powers like that, I shall believe in the sincerity of the promoters of the Bill. I am not prepared, as I have said all along, to allow another Medical Council to be formed with such extraordinary powers, so that to-day, while the members of the medical profession are excellent men and women, yet, as a body, they have, as most Members of this Committee would agree, now obtained most extraordinary powers. It is a commonplace for county borough councils and county councils to protest against the extraordinary salaries insisted uponâ€”I am saying this by way of illustrationâ€”by the Medical Council. I do not want that to happen with regard to the Royal Institute of British Architects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
