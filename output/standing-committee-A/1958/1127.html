	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Champion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 11, to leave out from " programme " to the end of the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on this Amendment to some extent will extend but not overlap the debate which we had on Tuesday. The Minister has rightly described the Bill as an enabling Measure, but by the inclusion of the words in line 11
	<br><blockquote><p>"of a duration of not less than three years "</p></blockquote>
he is placing himself under an unnecessary restriction in this connection, because he is not giving himself enough scope. It appears to be equally the case at the other end of the five-year period, with which we shall deal later. It is true, however, that the Minister is giving effect to some of the limitations which he set himself in his White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the schemes under the Bill are intended to make provision both for a farmer who has 20 acres and who just creeps in under the standard labour requirement calculation of 250 standard man-days, and for a farmer who farms 100 acres and who just gets in under the 460 standard man-days, as well as all those who come in between the two. Clearly, the permutations between those wide limits are as great as the permutations on the eight-match treble chance football pool, although I imagine that not many members of the Committee understand what I am talking about there. The White Paper itself makes this point, for we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be many possibilities varying according to the circumstances of each farm business."</p></blockquote>
Within those wide limits, it is not difficult to visualise circumstances in which capital and no other single thing is the limiting factor; there are circumstances in which there could be no other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
single factor limiting the farmer in getting the full value from his land. In such a case, the payment of the farm business grant in one or two years instead of being spread over three years, or even the farm business grant given in total in the first year, might well do the trick, but it seems to me that the Minister is preventing himself from doing that by the limitation which he is imposing in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My small farming experience is on a hill farm in South Wales. I am bound to say that the harrowing period was when we were seriously under-stocked for the capacity of the holding; getting the four additional cows and the few extra sheep which made all the difference was the greatest struggle of all. That is the period which my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) described last Tuesday as the period of Gethsemane—the period of tears and struggle. Once we on our small farm had managed to get those additional cows, the possibilities of even that small farm expanded considerably. The use of fertilisers became a possibility, a mowing machine was bought and we no longer had to wait for our hay-making equipment until a good neighbour had finished his hay harvest. All this in turn led to a higher stock-carrying capacity. It enabled us to go through this extremely difficult period into a period in which we were going reasonably well, having regard to the circumstances of the time—for, of course, those times were very bad indeed for the farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley made some fun of the schemes by pointing to the fact that the 20-acre farmer would receive a farm business grant of £120, paid in four instalments. My right hon. Friend wondered which half of the heifer the farmer would buy with the sum of £30. In his reply the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As I have already said, the first two payments come in the first twelve months. If a man proposes to buy extra stock, we want him to increase the capacity of his holding first.. We want him in the first twelve months to devote himself to increasing it. We hope that after that, with the improvement that he will get through this grant and the field husbandry grant, he will be in a position to buy at least one heifer or one bullock and not one half, as the right hon. Gentleman said. It will be found that the figures work out fairly well."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th November, 1958; Vol. 594, c. 148.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0741">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
I must admit that that sounds fair enough. But if the farm's present capacity is such that the holding could immediately carry the two heifers or bullocks which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary hopes the farmer will eventually get, why impose an artificial time restriction upon him? Putting two heifers down to calf straight away, if the holding could carry them, together with the field husbandry grant, might well enable that farmer to work up to more than two additional heifers or bullocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are matters which the N.A.A.S. man could very well decide by a glance at the farm. I am positive that if a district advisory officer had visited our farm in 1923 he would have seen at once that all we required to put us on our feet and to make the farm a satisfactory holding was four instalments of the business grant straight away, not spread over a long period. Knowing this industry, we recognise that the N.A.A.S. will be given a tremendous job. I am sure that the officers will manfully undertake that job, but, while it is right that the N.A.A.S. man should be given the limits of acreage and the size-of-farm-business tests and standard man-hour tests, I do not think there is the slightest necessity to impose upon the judgment of the N.A.A.S. man the restriction about the length of time it will take to bring the farm up to a decent standard and to enable the farmer to stand on his own feet and gain a satisfactory living, having regard to inevitable limitations of size, etc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, it will not be necessary for the N.A.A.S. man to decide the credit worthiness of the farmer, although I am sure that it would not be beyond the capacity of most of these people who are to be entrusted with deciding the adequacy of the programme, to make such a decision. But I think that the length of time which a programme should take and the point at which the capital injection should be made is a matter which he could well decide, and if we were to leave it to him, I am fairly sure that he could decide at which point it would be best to make the capital injection. I repeat that in some cases it would be better to inject at the start rather than in driblets over the three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
I should have preferred to have the last Amendment carried by the Committee rather than this Amendment, which is a second best but which is nevertheless a helpful Amendment to the Minister. I hope he will accept it. As I have said, any debate on the Amendment to a large extent can only underline what was so well said on the previous Amendment. The problem of the small farmer is so often merely that of obtaining that little additional capital at the start. Speaker after speaker in the last debate emphasised this aspect of the problem, and if speakers on the Government benches had backed their opinions by a vote, we should not merely have frightened the life out of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, as clearly we did at the end of Tuesday morning, but should have defeated the Government and caused the Minister to think again on what is the crucial problem of the small farmer—additional capital at that right point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a second best, as I freely admit, but it nevertheless offers some possibility of the Minister doing the right thing in this connection. I hope that he will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sidney Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion) on the very practical and sensible speech which he made, considering that he has not spent a life-time in agriculture. He has clearly made good use of the time during which he has been connected with agriculture, because he has offered to the Minister advice which is sound in every respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) has contended from the start that the Bill was formulated inside the Ministry from an administrative point of view. It looks neat and tidy to administer from Whitehall, but all practical people—the National Farmers' Union and everybody else connected with agriculture—have urged upon the Minister the need to amend this Clause so that it is not merely a tidy piece of administration for officials to carry out but brings to small farmers who need it the help which will enable them to make their farms profitable. Having rejected any form of loan, whether that recommended by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
National Fanners' Union or that recommended by us, the Minister is now being asked to consider making available the grants other than in four instalments in order that they may be paid to the small farmer at the beginning of the period, if he has shown that the need of the farm is for money to enable him to improve production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing from a practical point of view that when the advisory officer goes on to the farm to talk over with the farmer his scheme of improvement, if that farmer is a young and energetic farmer he will want to get on with it straight away. He will want to improve the fertility of his land, improve his grants, and then have the stock and equipment to deal with the greater production. Our contention is that the system of grants spread over four instalments in three years does not allow the man to go forward. The Minister is brindling him, holding him back, and preventing him from really getting ahead with the job on the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a practical point of view, therefore, I would say, as my hon. Friend has said, that this is a second best. Instead of a rigidly applied scheme all over the country for every kind and condition of small farm, we are asking that there should be greater elasticity. If all the people connected with a farm—the farmer himself, the visiting official and the agricultural committee—feel that, instead of giving four driblets, the farmer should get one sum that will enable him in the first year to increase production and profitability, then that is a sound proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am just wondering what the Minister can say in objection to this, because, as I said, if the same kind of scheme is operating right throughout the country then it is administratively tidy. But the Minister, of all people, knows that farming varies in different parts of the country and that the needs of the small farmer vary very much indeed. Therefore, he is asking for trouble in many cases if he just gives small grants and then the farmer gets into difficulty because, for some reason or other, he cannot continue the scheme and then a revocation of it is wanted. I think that this indicates the limit of the confidence which the Minister has in the ability of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
our small farmers to get on to the job, improve the farms and make those farms profitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give many illustrations of the rapidity with which any land in the country which has been starved of fertilisers and is understocked will increase its output of grass and crops tremendously within a year or two years. That is the great thing. I could give instances of where it is not now a question of making two blades of grass grow where one used to grow, but of making twenty blades of grass grow where previously one grew. The period of the year over which grass will grow can be extended; it can be made to start growing in March and to continue growing until the end of November by proper fertilisation and proper management, whereas without those things the grass may not be suitable for turning cattle on to it until the end of April or early May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, 1st May, that was the general date for turning cattle out to grass in a big part of the country. But now we can do it in March, and, as I say, continue right through the year until the end of November. If, then, the best advice enables the small farmer to put up his production to such an extent, he should be given help to enable him to do it, and should not be restricted either in the amount, as indicated in the scheme, or by those four instalments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the sole method by which the Minister is proposing to help the small farmer is by grants and advice, then I say to him that he should break with this rigid system and should allow those who are giving the farmer the advice to say, " You can do that this year; the amount of money we can make available to you can be used in whole this year and it will be much more profitable this year than next." That is what we want to see. I want to speed up the thing. I do not want to see farmers who are energetic young men and who want to go ahead held back. This bridling in the form of a grant offered under this scheme seems to me to be the greatest hindrance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, from a practical point of view, and knowing at any rate the eastern part of England very well, I can say that if the Government want to make this scheme the greatest possible success
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
amongst small farmers then we must ease up the scheme, allow it to be more elastic, give both the advisers to the small farmers and the committees more discretion and encourage the small farmers to go ahead more rapidly. I am sure it will pay the country in the long run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. John Hare)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might, perhaps, intervene at this juncture. I have been very interested in the speeches of both hon. Gentlemen who have spoken so far today. I think we are probably at cross purposes. I think that, perhaps, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion) did not realise what his Amendment would do if we accepted it. It would imply that a farmer would not have to work out a scheme in conjunction with the help of the advisory service under the cover period of three years for improvement of that farm. That I think would be undesirable and would wreck the intent of the Bill, which is that a long-term plan of improvement should be agreed by the farmer and worked out and carried out on the individual farm. On the other hand, what the hon. Gentleman is really after is that there should be some speeding up of the actual instalment payments, which my hon. Friend at the last meeting of the Committee quite correctly said were planned at the moment to be made at six, twelve, twenty-four and thirty-six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What both the hon. Gentlemen want is, if necessary, a greater speeding up in the paying out of those instalments. That does not really come into the Bill at all. The actual paying out will come out in the details of the scheme. I think that both hon. Gentlemen have raised an interesting point which I should like to think about in the process of the drafting of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have made a point which I should like to consider, but I cannot actually accept the Amendment because I do not think that it really achieves the object which they themselves have in mind. I hope that with that rather brief explanation the hon. Gentleman might, perhaps, consider withdrawing his Amendment, on the understanding that I have listened very sympathetically and carefully to the points that have been made and that I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
would consider them without commitment, because I cannot give commitments on the preparation of the scheme itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frederick Willey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the right hon. Gentleman on the last point? I appreciate the point about the scheme being long-term. He will appreciate, I think, that we do not want to pursue this matter too far, but we have to consider this enabling Bill in the light of the proposals in the White Paper. My hon. Friend very properly put in issue the question of instalments. It is upon that question that we have some doubt, and I should like to put a simple case to the right hon. Gentleman. We have the young farmer making his way up the ladder, and it might make a very real difference to a man whether he got a once-for-all payment to carry out his scheme or whether he was held back, as my hon. Friend said, by being tied to these instalments. If the right hon. Gentleman will give the Committee an assurance that he will consider that point and consult the advisers, I think that would go some way towards meeting the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly prepared to give the hon. Gentleman and the other two hon. Gentlemen who spoke the assurance that I will consider the point which the hon. Member from Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) has just emphasised. Under Clause 1 (1, 	<i>c</i>) of the Bill I could, in fact, comprise within my scheme something which might go some way to help what the hon. Gentleman has suggested, but I must look at this very carefully. The hon. Gentlemen have put a very careful and considered case to me and I should like to give it proper consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to express our appreciation to the Minister for his readiness and willingness to look at this matter. We appreciate that the Bill is, as I said, more or less a machinery Measure. It is the scheme that matters, and which will matter, and if points of this description arise in the course of the Committee's deliberations with which the Minister feels that he can deal effectively under the scheme, we shall be quite ready to withdraw any Amendments that we have on the Order Paper on the guarantee which the right hon. Gentleman has given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not given a guarantee; I have expressed an honest desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant to say a guarantee to look at the matter sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just add this? I want the right hon. Gentleman to help us to ensure that this matter can be raised on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Slater</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather concerned about this argument. I said on Second Reading that the Bill would be very controversial and very unacceptable to the small farmers up and down the country. How true that is. We received no formal objection from the Government benches when we were presenting our case in regard to the argument that has been proceeded with by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion) in moving this Amendment and, which, as far as I am concerned, he moved most efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend developed his argument, he came down to the position of the man-hours required. So long as the Government keep to this matter of the man-hours the small farmer is going to feel himself in a very difficult position indeed. I, like other Members of this Committee, and no doubt other Members of the House, have received correspondence from many small farmers in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is going to refer to that part of the correspondence he has received which deals with the length of the programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Slater</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It concerns the White Paper that deals with this Bill and it concerns the form of operation of the small farmer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make it quite clear that that is not what we are discussing; we are discussing a particular Amendment dealing with the length of the programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Slater</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend developed his argument he spoke on the matter of man-hours of the small farmer, and that is why I am dealing with it at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advisory officers are now coming to the county districts and are meeting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
the small farmers. I know of small farmers with 35 acres who do not qualify for this assistance that is supposed to be given to the small farmer if he is efficient. They are outside the Bill altogether. I sincerely hope that the Minister, in giving further consideration to the question, will seek to give serious consideration to the position of those people who are classified as efficient but who do not qualify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Champion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the Minister for his very sympathetic reply to what I think is a fair point. I am bound to agree with the Minister that we ought to have a long-term plan of improvement of at least three years. It seemed to us that this was the only way in which we could get at the White Paper itself, or at the programmes and so on in the White Paper itself. Therefore, the Amendment had to be put down.

Perhaps I may conclude with a word of advice to the Parliamentary Secretary. If only he had handled the debate last Tuesday as well as his Minister has handled the debate this morning, he would at least have eaten his lunch without the fear of the carpeting, which, quite clearly, he had last Tuesday afternoon. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

some figures taken from Government publications and otherwise in support of my argument. The first is from paragraph 18 of the White Paper, where it says that there are over 500,000 holdings in the country, and that the full-time businesses would amount to 300,000. Of this 300,000, two-thirds are above the maximum qualification for benefit. As a result of that, 65,000 farmers only are expected to benefit under the small farmers scheme. An additional 25,000 former recipients of marginal assistance may also gain something under the scheme, making 90,000 in all, or 18 per cent. of all the holdings in the country—less than one in five. I would stress that at the beginning of paragraph 18 the Minister says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Although there are over 500,000 agricultural holdings in the United Kingdom, a large number of these are part-time or spare-time holdings."</p></blockquote>
The figures which I will now quote are taken from Agricultural Statistics, 1955–56. They may be a little out of date, but they were published in 1957. Although they may not be strictly accurate for the present time, I think that they are sufficiently accurate to indicate the general position in the country, and the general trend towards the reduction of holdings over recent years. In 1955, the total number of holdings for England and Wales was 369,000, and in 1954, it was 375,000 so in twelve months there had been a reduction of nearly 6,000. Of those under five acres there had been a reduction of 3,000. There was a reduction of nearly 1,500 holdings between five and 15 acres, and a reduction of 216 in the class between 15 and 20 acres, giving a total reduction of holdings under five acres of 4,700. I am keeping to round figures because one does not want to be bothered with the digits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This represents a reduction in one year of 2.75 per cent., and I believe, from the statistics that the predecessor of the Parliamentary Secretary gave some years ago, this trend was in operation then. I have no doubt that it is in operation now. I feel certain that if the Bill goes through, the reduction is going to be severe and, over five or ten years, catastrophic. The Cornwall branch of the National Farmers' Union estimate that 49 per cent. of all the holdings in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
Cornwall are under 20 acres. My calculation from these statistics is 48.1 per cent., but I notice that the London headquarters of the National Farmers' Union put it at 47 per cent. Whatever is the correct figure, it is certainly substantial, and almost one-half of the whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday, the Parliamentary Secretary answered a Question of mine about agricultural holdings, and for the purpose of the record it might be as well if I read out both Question and Answer. I asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many agricultural holdings under 20 acres and over 20 acres, respectively, are farmed by part-time farmers. The Parliamentary Secretary replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The Agricultural Returns do not show whether the occupier is engaged part-time or full-time on the holding. A sample of these returns for England and Wales, has, however, been specially examined with reference to average labour requirements which is the nearest we can get to such an analysis. From this examination it is estimated that there are about 136,000 separate holdings with less than 20 acres of crops and grass on which the average labour requirement for the cropping and stocking adds up to less than 250 standard man-days, and most of these are almost certainly part-time holdings. There are about 13,000 of such holdings over 20 acres."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th November, 1958; Vol. 596, c. 9.]</p></blockquote>
The vital figure there is 136,000 separate holdings under 20 acres, and most of them are almost certainly part-time holdings. If one takes 120,000 as a reasonable figure, that means a reduction of. 16,000. On the Parliamentary Secretary's statement we find that about 25 per cant, of all the agricultural holdings in the country are part-time holdings, or spare-time holdings, as the Minister put it. That is one in every four of all agricultural holdings in the country, and that, I think, is the measure of the effect of the Amendment in my name and in the names of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, if I may, to quote a council resolution of the National Farmers' Union. It was sent a day or two ago to all Members of the Standing Committee. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The Council, following discussion, and having regard to the written opinions of some County Branches since the release of the details of the Small Farmer Schemes:
	<ol>
	<li>Acknowledge that the Schemes represent a serious attempt to help some small farmers.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
	<li>Maintains, however, that very many potentially viable small farmers will be unaided.</li>
	<li>Re-affirms that the removal of the lower acreage limit would bring in many men whose farm businesses are potentially viable according to the economic standard.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Their exclusion from the Schemes amounts to the removal of a stepping stone from farming ".</p></blockquote>
I suggest that the statistics which I have already quoted put the Amendment in perspective. One-quarter of all the holdings are part-time. I should like, if I may, to quote once more, this time again from the memorandum sent to us by the National Farmers' Union. Under the heading " Part-time holdings ", it reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>" While there is general recognition within the National Farmers' Union that the problem of part-time holdings is one which raises serious sociological issues and that it was never the general intention of the Government to make these schemes available to the part-time or hobby farmer, we consider that there are at least two categories of part-time farmers to which quite different considerations apply. These are referred to in the proposed Amendment to Clause 1, line 20, which seeks to extend the category of eligibility to those farmers part of whose time is spent employed on neighbouring farms or in forestry plantations ".</p></blockquote>
I do not think it will be trespassing on the next Amendment—in any case the Amendments are being taken together—if I quote from the Forestry Commission's Report for the year ended 30th September, 1957. It says that the total non-industrial staff employed by the Commission is 2,604. The non-industrial staff in England is 5,469, in Scotland 4,425, and in Wales 3,146, a total of 13,040. The National Farmers' Union particularise Wales, and when one finds that only 3,146 are employed in Wales, one can see that, as far as this memorandum is concerned, our Amendment applies to most of those who have never been employed in forestry at all, because the total number of these part-time holdings is 120,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement of the National Farmers' Union that it thinks of these 120,000 holdings as farmed by hobby farmers is a gross insult to one of the most deserving bodies of people in the whole country. I am amazed that they should have used that term in regard to these small part-time farmers who farm less than 20 acres. I took the liberty this morning of checking my own evaluation of the word " hobby ". If I may quote from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary it says:—
	<br><blockquote><p>" A favourite occupation or topic pursued for amusement ".</p></blockquote>
I am really amazed that the National Farmers' Union should have come to such a conclusion. I am quite sure that its members in the Cornwall branch, at any rate, would have a very different opinion. My hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Philips Price) does not think they have, but all I have done is to quote from the memorandum. I do so with great sorrow, because before this I had a higher opinion of the National Farmers' Union and of Sir James Turner, its President. Nevertheless, that is the memorandum which it has circulated to Members of this Standing Committee. I am quite certain, too, that other county branches would be like the Cornish branch, and would not endorse such a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that the first page of the memorandum of the National Farmers' Union gives percentages of some counties with holdings of under 20 acres. It says that Cornwall has 47 per cent., Lancashire 48 per cent. and the whole of England and Wales 45 per cent. It is significant that the National Fanners' Union did not refer to another section of part-time farmers—a section perhaps to whom the term " amusement " might apply. But I will not insult so eminent a body of men as to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am speaking in the House of Commons where we must regard our colleagues as honourable. Many of our hon. and right hon. Friends on both sides of the Committee are part-time farmers. I would not say that they are pursuing their part-time farming for amusement. Professional men, industrialists and even speculators, by and large, inject into this important industry a large amount of capital which it sorely needs. By virtue of the fact that it is part-time and that they are not wholly responsible for the day-to-day management, they can finance many experiments which might not otherwise be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder how far there may be collusion between the Minister and the Knightsbridge Committee of the N.F.U. This is how the National Committee of the Union regards the small part-time farmer. Is this Bill an indication of how
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
the Minister and the Government regard these farmers? There seems some similarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was very young, I assiduously went to church on Sunday afternoons for catechism and we used to sing a hymn called " All things bright and beautiful." One of the verses was:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The rich man in his castle,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The poor man at his gate,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>God made them high or lowly,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And Ordered their estate."</p></blockquote>
The Minister and the union are trying to order a state of farming in this country which benefits the rich man in his castle and hurts the small man at his gate. Fortunately, over the years this general application has been 'toned down, but it is typical of the mind of the last century and even of the early part of this century when I went to church. I may add that I go to church quite often now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the union accept into membership tens of thousands of small part-time farmers. These include quarry-men, miners and people who work in factories. [An HON. MEMBER: " Also the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Aneurin Bevan)."] My right hon. Friend would, I think, come into the richer class. These people are making a very valuable contribution to our agricultural life, and this upholds a tradition widespread throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cornwall, these small holdings are often in areas of mine or quarry waste and cannot be absorbed into large farming units because of their isolation, but they provide a way of life which is extremely valuable. I have no doubt that Members opposite say this, too, and quite sincerely, but now they are supporting a Bill designed to wipe out this important class of agricultural producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area many of the men who carry on these holdings do so as a kind of insurance against unemployment. They often earn low wages. They have periods of casual employment and then they depend on these holdings to help give them a decent Standard of life. Acre for acre, these small holdings produce as much as bigger holdings over the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg the Government not to sentence this eminently useful class of the community to death by a thousand cuts, the torture that, I understand, was once prevalent in China. I would remind the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
Parliamentary Secretary that in two world wars the Government of the day had to 'turn to the part-time producer arid appeal to him to get as much food out of his holding as possible—pig meat, eggs, milk and vegetables. These men responded nobly, and I beg the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the Amendment and not to throw them to the wolves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to look back on what was said on this issue when we discussed the farm improvement scheme in the debate on the Agricultural Bill, 1957. I want to emphasise what is in my Amendment, though I agree to a large extent with what my hon. Friend said in his remarks concerning part-time farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I base my remarks on what we have said in mid-Wales in connection with the mid-Wales Report. Whatever may be said about that Report it has been referred to in the House of Commons and in Committees perhaps more than any other Report about Wales for a very long time. It was a very important Report, and it started its investigation with the basic assumption as stated in paragraph 4 (	<i>d</i>).
	<br><blockquote><p>" That forestry, properly integrated with agriculture, will be developed in the reference area."</p></blockquote>
Everybody assumed that that was going to be the way of the economy of mid-Wales and of other parts of the country in the future. But this Bill does not make provision for that for part-time workers, either those working on neighbouring farms or those engaged in forestry work. The Minister accepted this principle in connection with some aspects of the farm improvement scheme, and I am glad he did. It would be interesting to know to what extent it has been accepted in some of the schemes of part-time improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Chancellor of the Exchequer, when Minister of Agriculture, made the following important statement which I hope all hon. Members will take into consideration:
	<br><blockquote><p>" No one could be keener than I am on integration of forestry and agriculture. I believe that is absolutely sound and we want them integrated more than at present."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee A,</i> 7th May, 1957; c. 267.]</p></blockquote>
I suggest that if the Bill goes through as it is we shall not be able to carry out the wishes of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer as expressed when he was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
Minister of Agriculture. Furthermore, statements were made by the Parliamentary Secretary in the same debate. They made this very significant point, and I accepted it with acclamation; they emphasised that part-time forestry work was good and appropriate and played a valuable part in farming. The part-time worker can play an important part in agriculture and in afforestation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mid-Wales Investigation Report made the following important announcement:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Small units in convenient situations are being farmed on a part-time basis by foresters, roadmen and other rural workers and it is likely that a considerable proportion of such units will continue to be farmed in this way indefinitely."</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying that we have come to the end of that? If he does, then we can call mid-Wales a desert in the future and the sooner a fence is put up in the minds of the people the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope these people will so develop their farms, however poor the land may be, with part-time work that they become really economic holdings. That is the wish of everyone concerned with agriculture. Recognition of this aspect is shared by a number of people and it is generally accepted that there are now full-time holdings in all parts of the country which were part-time before the war. This occurred because of rising prices and better prices and because there has been a decline in supplementary employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the Bill as it is, there will be a further decline in supplementary employment and those who thought they could have a living by joint work in forestry and agriculture may abandon the holdings altogether and join the trek of large numbers of those in mid-Wales who have become redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another important point. Has there been a change of attitude by the Ministry towards the whole situation of part-time employment either in agriculture or forestry? In the last two years or so the Forestry Commission has signed a contract for ten years for private people to do thinnings in afforestation. That contract has been made with one firm, creating a monopoly, and that monopoly in thinnings does not give employment to all who would like to do afforestation and may have some effect on part-time workers getting employment with forestry in the future. That is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
important in some of the villages in Wales. I hope that the Minister will give an indication in that respect because it is so essential for those who work part-time holdings in constituencies like mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill ought to include provisions bringing in the part-time farmers who are also working on neighbouring farms. Take the case of the son of a farmer who has taken one of these small hill farms. He works it part-time and also works on his father's farm. Surely, the Minister will not say that that particular farmer will not get any help from the Bill. That is the type of development in mid-Wales which should be encouraged, for in that area there is a tradition, which works very well, of young people starting on their parents' small farms and ultimately getting larger, economic holdings of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Zuckerman Report contains an important chapter on the case for the integration of forestry and agriculture. The Government have acted against the recommendation of that Report which stressed the need for the integration of forestry and agriculture. The Report points out that such an integration provides men and horses for the Forestry Commission. Are we to understand that in future men working part-time on their holdings will be denied assistance unless they stay on their farms trying to make them economic? In the summer, many small farmers find employment as fire watchers, which is also a very important part-time work. In return, the Forestry Commission lends workers, heavy equipment and transport to the small farmers. That integration should not be spoiled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not like what the N.F.U. had to say about hobby farmers. I am not concerned about hobby farmers, but if the expression includes those people who have a knowledge of and an interest in agriculture, then it is misleading. People who come outside that category are of no use to mid-Wales and are not likely to go there. I am glad the N.F.U. supports the Amendment. The N.F.U. said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The Union considers it of great importance that such men "—</p></blockquote>
that is, the small farmers who are also forestry workers—
	<br><blockquote><p>" who play a vital role in the rural economy of the less prosperous areas, should not be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
discriminated against; and that on the contrary they should be helped The Union would, therefore, warmly support the proposed amendment."</p></blockquote>
Although I am trying to speak in English and think in Welsh, it will not be denied that I have put a case for Wales. I hope that the Government will consider this matter from the point of view of the man who works part time on a holding. I hope that the hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) will support the Amendment. He knows the difficulties of small holdings, and I hope that he will lend his support. I hope that when he comes to retire, he will be able to put that support to his credit and say that whatever else he may have done for guaranteed prices, the climax of his career was that he supported the Welsh hill farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. M. Philips Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of eligibility for grant of part-time holdings is extremely important and complex. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins) referred to small farmers and smallholders working for the Forestry Commission in Brecon and Radnor, and my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Hayman) spoke of small farmers working in small industries in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Forest of Dean, there are other types of equally important farmers who, on an acreage basis and on the standard man-hours basis, would qualify for grant under the Bill, but who are not strictly speaking full-time farmers. I am thinking of one farm which I know very well. The farmer has a holding which would qualify on an acreage and standard man-hours basis, but he works in a mine part-time. His son also works on the farm part-time as well as in a small local industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would such a case be covered? So far as I can see, it would not qualify, and yet that may be the sort of case which needs most help. Such a man might want to improve hillside pastures and possibly make silage, which is very important if we are to stop importing cake, and he may want to build a silo or even increase stock. The important thing with a Measure of this kind is to avoid unfairness, and yet unfairness certainly occurs with the case I have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
Such men, as well as those who work part-time for the Forestry Commission, are the sort of small farmers who produce food for sale on the market. There are others who produce food only for themselves. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne criticised the N.F.U. circular which said that it was very important to avoid giving assistance to certain types of hobby farmers. However, the circular said that it was never the general intention of the Government to make these schemes available to hobby farmers, although the N.F.U. considered that there were at least two categories of part-time farmers to whom quite different considerations applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The N.F.U. was speaking of holdings of under 20 acres. I doubt very much whether stockbrokers go in for holdings of less than 20 acres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philips Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they do. Public money should not be spent on people of that kind. One has to find some means of giving assistance to those who are struggling, while cutting out those for whom it does not matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know only too well the country in which I have lived all my life, the country between the Severn and Wye and the Forest of Dean. The area contains many smallholders who work in local industries and mines, but who are nevertheless not just subsistence farmers. If they were, it would be another matter and I am not sure that I should be so keen on spending public money on them. One has to consider whether one is giving grants to those who will assist the country's general agriculture production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many small farmers are doing that and the man whom I have mentioned sells milk and eggs, and rears calves for the market. That latter activity is very important. The small farmer on the Wlesh border country is one of the most
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
important producers of yearling stock, which is sold to farmers on the richer lands of the lowlands. We all know that the store markets of the Welsh borders are among the most important for the supply of stock for the better lands further east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very often, these holdings would qualify for assistance in size and man-hours, although worked only part time. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to put their heads together and to consider this difficulty so that something can be found to assist in those cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Archer Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the Amendment, but I shall not support it if it goes to a Division. My reason is that my right bon. Friend is very perturbed about whether his Ministry will be able to deal with the number of small farmers who will be brought into the scope of the present Bill. I am not prepared to ask him to include a multitude of other small farmers at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that my right hon. Friend will note what has been said and that as soon as work on the Bill is concluded, he will introduce another to help those small farmers under 20 acres, the part-time holders, the cottage holders and others who will have to contribute towards the larger farms covered by the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument against helping them has been that they are not economic, but it depends on what is meant by " economic ". Does it mean economic in the farmer's interest, or in the national interest? The small farm, the smallholding and the cottage holding are national economic assets. There is not the slightest doubt that more small farmers and smallholders should be encouraged to work under the Forestry Commission. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins) said, they can do very useful work with a horse. I suggest that the Forestry Commission frequently use a heavy, high-powered tractor to do a job which one of these smallholders could do as well, if not better, with a horse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that the Government would bring these forestry workers into the scheme as part-time workers. I think I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
am right in saying that in Switzerland, a country of great forestry development, the small farmer is allocated a portion of woodland and it is his duty to see that that woodland is developed according to instructions by some authority, perhaps similar to the Forestry Commission. During the winter he can spend much time in the forest when he would find it difficult to do economical work on his own holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the situation of the smallholder who is only a part-time worker and who increases his income by working on neighbouring farms. I maintain that such a man is extremely useful to our economy. He often does his milking at night and in the morning, either before or after his day's work on a neighbouring farm, and his wife looks after the small amount of farming which has to be done during the day. The neighbouring farmer, whom he assists, is willing in return for his work to provide some assistance on that small farm. There is a certain amount of reciprocity. Whereas the small farmer cannot plough five acres economically, the larger farmer for whom he is working can reciprocate and plough it for him, and, when he is doing his own harvesting, can do a little harvesting for him, too. In my opinion the part-time smallholder is an economic asset to the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an illustration from my own constituency of a man who started in the valleys of Wales. His father was a part-time smallholder who worked in the mine. When this young man left school he became a part-time worker on his father's farm and also worked in the mine, but since he did not like the mining work he used his brains—he was an intelligent young man—and went into the markets and did a little dealing. His work consisted of running the smallholding and doing a little dealing. As a result of his efforts, that man today is one of the big farmers in my constituency. For a year or two he was chairman of the county National Farmers' Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This shows what can be done by a smallholder working part-time on his own land and part-time elsewhere. I therefore hope that my right hon. Friend will give serious thought to this question and that when he gets this Bill out of the way he will consider introducing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
another Bill on the subject, which I am sure will receive support from both sides of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. W. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a word on behalf of the Welsh farmer. We have heard of the hobby farmer in England, a creature who is unknown in Wales. I want to give the Committee an impression of the pattern of farming in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have 54,000 holdings. Of that number, 24,000 are between 20 and 100 acres. We have 20,000 holdings below 20 acres. Altogether, 44,000 out of the 54,000 are small farmers. In my speech on Second Reading I made these observations, which are relevant to the argument this morning:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… in Wales there are 22,000 holdings below the 20-acre mark. Several such holdings in Merioneth are considered by the larger farmers to be the reservoir which provides them with farm workers. Speaking generally, we do not find in North Wales the ordinary farm labourer of the type to be found, for instance, in Norfolk. That is why the Farmworkers' Union is not so strong in Wales. These are family farms and the husband not only looks after his own small farm but Spends the day helping a larger farmer."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th November, 1958; Vol. 594, c. 67.]</p></blockquote>
When I read in the Bill that only full-time farmers will qualify for the grant, I ask myself who on earth could be a fuller-time farmer than the small farmer in North Wales who spends the whole day, from dawn to dusk, if not on his own farm then on somebody else's. He is producing in the national interest. This farmer should have the full encouragement of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1955 the Welsh Agricultural Land Sub-Commission submitted the Mid-Wales Investigation Report, in which we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>" We consider that there should be a number of small holdings in favourable areas within reasonable reach of centres of community life, in order to diversify the agricultural economy and to provide farming opportunities for young people. There is a very number of small units in the reference area "—</p></blockquote>
that is, Mid-Wales—
	<br><blockquote><p>" and we consider that some units up to about 30 acres will continue to be occupied on a part-time basis.… Smallholders who are unable to provide machinery for their own holdings are able to co-operate with neighbouring occupiers of large farms on a mutual basis ".</p></blockquote>

After all that has been said by my right hon. Friends and by the hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin), I hope that the Minister will have second thoughts on this question and will be prepared to help those thousands of hardworking men who are working from dawn to dusk, mainly engaged in agriculture. After all, afforestation is agricultural work. During the Recess, my hon. Friends the Members for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins) and Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion) and I went through the forests of Wales, and we were more than ever convinced that there is the closest connection between afforestation and agriculture. These part-time farmers are be seen working in the forests. The number of them has been stated; it is 3,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have sufficiently impressed the Minister this morning for him at least to have second thoughts on this question, and we hope that on Report he will have good news for these farmers of North Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support the general plea for the part-time small farmer on three grounds, on none of which I propose to take unduly long. The hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) rightly raised the entire question of what is economic in small farming and in agriculture generally. It is an industry in which it is extremely difficult to apply safe and fair rules of economic measurement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major economic advantages of small farming in this country, and especially in Wales, is that very often it is the only way to use the land in that part of the country. From time to time armchair experts suggest that these small farmers should be lumped together to make what are called viable units, but it is impossible to join together the kind of smallholdings which comprise a large proportion of the acreage of Caernarvonshire. There is no other way of farming many parts of Snowdonia except on the basis of what we call small farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an economic argument for the small farmer. In many parts of Great Britain he is the right operator. This is not a very large island and our land is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
very limited; indeed, the acreage is getting smaller every day, with the incursions of non-farming demands. We must therefore be extremely careful before we write off either the small full-time farmer or the large number of small part-time operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second justification is one which has been very strongly made in the debate. These part-time holdings are a very valuable training ground for bigger farmers. My bon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Philips Price) put his finger on one of the most important ways in which part-time farmers can contribute in a very necessary and effective way to the national production of essential foods, and that is in the rearing of yearling stock, so suitable for the smallholdings, which is then sold and sent to the richer and more easily worked farms in the valleys and on the coasts. My hon. Friend mentioned part-time farmers on the Welsh border, but in Caernarvon and Merioneth many of these part-time operators are doing that. I do not say that too many of them are still producing milk and eggs and are not venturing into stock raising, but the venture into rearing calves ought to be supported and encouraged. The Bill stops short of encouraging precisely the kind of part-time farmer who could make an immense contribution to the production of strong yearling stock, which could in time be improved on larger farms and made ready for the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I agree with the hon. Member for Leominster when he hints that the Government should withdraw the Bill and introduce a more comprehensive Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest withdrawing the Bill. I suggested that we should get this Bill out of the way as quickly as possible, not spending too much time on it in Committee, and should then ask my right hon. Friend to introduce a small Bill which would deal with the cases of which we have been speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will not be in office to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best way to get the Bill out of the way is to withdraw it and to substitute a Bill which will deal not particularly with the small operator but with the whole field. It is a great mistake
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
to divide the full-time small farmer from the part-time small farmer; they are one economic type, and the appropriate Measure would be one which dealt with the small farming industry, whether full-time or part-time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, short of actually withdrawing the Bill and introducing another one, the Parliamentary Secretary will seriously give consideration to accepting these Amendments which would bring in these very necessary and very useful provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. J. B. Godber)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it might be convenient to the Committee if I intervene at this stage—we have had a fairly considerable discussion—although there are a number of Members who feel strongly about the matter and necessarily have constituency points they wish to put. If I indicate the Government's attitude towards this group of Amendments it might be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I think that the debate we have already had shows clearly what difficult and dangerous ground any Minister of Agriculture treads when he seeks to deal with the small farmer's problems. This debate illustrates more clearly than anything else could how difficult it is when one seeks to divide, as one has to in facing this problem honestly, what one can do from what one cannot do. That is really what we have to get to grips with in relation to this Bill and to these amendments in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister made quite clear in his initial statements that he realised the difficulties and dangers when he was trying to do something for the small farmer; but he had to define and limit his objective clearly, otherwise it would have been impractical or even impossible to have brought in such a Bill. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) was on a fair point when he said that, while he sympathised with the desires suggested by hon. Members opposite, he realised the problem which the Minister had in dealing with the number of small farmers who will be concerned under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend suggested that we could bring forward other proposals. That is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
a very laudable suggestion, and I would remind the Committee that the White Paper which we issued with the Bill says in paragraph 5:
	<br><blockquote><p>" There are many farm businesses that are not capable of providing remunerative full-time employment to an average occupier. A considerable number of these are part-time only. To the extent, however, that non-viable farm businesses present a special problem the Government have been studying this and will continue to do so ".</p></blockquote>
That shows that we are aware of this problem and that we are continuing to look at it; but it is not an easy problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the Amendment which has been moved and to the other Amendments which we have been discussing, The hon. Member who initiated this debate spoke with great force and feeling, and I can understand, as he represents a Cornish constituency, the feeling in that part of the world. He quoted a large number of figures which were of great interest, but from them he drew the conclusion that 25 per cent. of all holdings were part-time. Strictly, on the figures, that is true. But as the hon. Gentleman well knows, these figures include every holding of over one acre, and a large number are between one and five acres. These are large gardens in many cases or, perhaps, holdings used for various different projects which could not clearly come within the scope of what we are seeking to do. The actual number of problem cases which the hon. Member has genuinely in mind is, of course, very much smaller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member waxed hot and indignant about the N.F.U. and hobby farmers. It is not for me to defend the N.F.U. in regard to these matters, but I was interested that we were charged with collusion between the N.F.U. and the Government. In the case of the last Bill I think we were definitely not charged with that, but in Committee we had rather different charges brought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to the hon. Member, I could not help feeling sorry that we had not with us the hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will send for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grieved to think that the hon. Gentleman cannot. I recall that on the last Bill he waxed very eloquent about the hobby farmer who, he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
thought, was a most pernicious thing. There is something between the hon. Member and his hon. Friends which he should clear up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman and all Members of the Committee who are reading the quotation from the memorandum of the N.F.U. cannot alter what they said about the part-time or hobby farmer. According to that, every part-time farmer was a hobby farmer, except perhaps the small farmer who might be engaged in help on farms or afforestation. There is no getting away from what they said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must carry his argument to Agriculture House. I do not think it is for me to develop the opposition. I have stood up valiantly for the N.F.U. in these last few moments——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Too much sometimes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But he did go on to talk of Members of Parliament being part-time and insinuating that it would be a gross insult to Members of Parliament to be described as pursuing this for amusement—I think those were his words. Some of us are involved in agriculture. I leave it to the Committee to judge whether the amusement is to be found more in farming or in listening to the hon. Member, and we must consider this on its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To keep the records clear, I think I said that I did not believe that all or most of the well-to-do part-time farmers were farming for amusement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to misrepresent the hon. Member, but I would have one more word on his speech in that he did puzzle me very much towards the conclusion when he referred to this Bill being designed to aid " the rich man in his castle". When we brought in the Measure entitled " Agriculture (Small Farmers) Bill ", I was prepared for all sorts of charges, but not for the one that we were assisting the rich man. It shows what pitfalls there are for any Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins), in a very honourable and genuine appeal on behalf of Welsh farmers who have particular problems, put forward a similar plea to the one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
put forward when we discussed the Farm Improvement Scheme in the House. He did me the honour of quoting something I said when that was before the House and what the then Minister said. I would remind him in relation to this problem that we are really being consistent in our approach, although consistency in this case may not endear us to the hon. Member. But we felt in relation to the Farm Improvement Scheme, and we feel again now, that what we have got to do is to encourage and assist a farm that can be a viable unit. That was exactly what we said. I would quote my own words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 7th May, 1957, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" If a holder is working part-time on his holdings and, with the assistance of his wife or family, is able to maintain it sufficiently so it may be classified as producing a full-time earning for one man, it would come within the scope of the provision."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee A,</i> 7th May, 1957; c. 244.]</p></blockquote>
But I said that it was, in fact, on the basis of a full-time holding that I was considering the matter. I quote those particular words because I want to bring to the hon. Member's attention once more what I said then, that it is not necessary that the man himself shall actually be engaged on the holding full-time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard man-days are the basis. If the man himself is working part-time on his holding and if he receives some assistance, perhaps from his wife or anyone else, and if the standard man-days reached 250, then it does not matter in the least whether he has a job somewhere else. That matter applies also to the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Philips Price). He actually instanced the case of a miner who had over 250 man-days in spite of working as a miner. He would qualify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it apply, for example, to crofters in the outer islands of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not well versed about the crofters of the outer islands. I am sorry. Some day the hon. Member must take me there and show me, but these are outside my field and I prefer to leave that to my noble Friend. But on this point I want, because it is so important, to emphasise that so long as they can qualify with 250 man-days it does not matter whether they are working full-time or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And under 20 acres,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; I am dealing with over 20 acres. The acreage is clear and precise; but on the man-days it is important to get the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I emphasise this point? If the number of man-days is below 250 that does not automatically cut the man out. If he can show as a result of an improvement scheme it would come to 275 man-days, although it is below 250 to start with, it would qualify. With that fact and the fact that he can be doing other work part-time, I would say that many of these cases deserve looking into and many would be found to qualify. I hope that that will prove of help. But I must stick for the present on the clear understanding that our intention is directed towards farms which can be economic units—to a farm business which can be an economic unit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman allow me to intervene, because what he has just said is very important? It seems to me that he is arguing for the acceptance of the Amendment which I moved concerning whole-time occupation. As far as I recollect, this term " full-time occupation " is not defined in the Interpretation Clause, and, therefore, it really does seem that the hon. Gentleman accepts this Amendment in principle, or, any way, that he should bring forward something which would cover his interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is paying me a compliment in saying I am supporting his Amendment. I am trying to show how nearly the Bill is drawn to his Amendment. If he will look at subparagraph (	<i>a</i>) from which he wishes to delete the words " as a full-dime occupation " he will see that it is covered by the words associated with that. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" a farm business capable of yielding an adequate return to any person carrying it on with reasonable efficiency and as a full-time occupation ".</p></blockquote>
That is the clue and I am advised that it is fully within the terms of the Bill as now drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But to make it transparently clear to every Member of the Committee, may I ask whether I am right in understanding the Parliamentary Secretary to mean that any standard of man-days less than 250 in the year devoted to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
the small farm, despite supplementary work on other farms or afforestation, would disqualify that person from receiving a grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said, or what I certainly intended to convey, was that if at present a man has 250 man-days he automatically qualifies for consideration. If below that, he could put in a scheme; and if by showing from that scheme that it would total at the end of a three year period—or whatever the period was—275 man-days then he is within the terms of the scheme. But any work he does on any other holding has no bearing on it at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position, and that is as we have sought to define it. So, in fact, we are looking at the business and mot at the person who actually works on it. That means 'that we will have a man working part-time who can be assisted by his family part-time which would enable him to qualify. We are trying to meet many of the oases that have been brought to mind; but I did say that I did not intend to go any wider than that, because, if we sought to embrace all the part-time holdings, I am afraid that we could not stand up to the problem. That was the reason for the words in paragraph 5 of the White Paper to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to deal with the points brought forward by hon. Members, and I hope that in the light of what I have said they will be willing to come to a decision on this Amendment, which I realise is an important one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disappoint the Parliamentary Secretary if he thinks that I can encourage the Committee to come to an immediate decision. We need a better reply if we are to avoid the dangers into which the Government fell last time. It is quite clear that the reply is inadequate. The real reason for this is that we have failed to get from the present Government any clear conception of their agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind the Committee that we discussed this problem, as the Parliamentary Secretary will remember, on the 1957 Bill. But what was the position
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
when we discussed agriculture in the terms of the 1957 Bill? We had the Government proposing that assistance should be given to agriculture by way of loans at preferential rates of interest. That was the purpose behind the farm improvement grants. We were also told that those should not be loaded on to the Price Review award, but should be raised entirely separately from that award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are taking a diametrically opposite view with regard to the present Bill. This places us in real difficulty, and I appreciate the difficulties of the hon. Gentleman for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin), who says that we must get this through and proceed to another Bill. He is saying that he does not concede for a moment that the Government have produced any solution , that they must go on trying and that, eventually, they may find a solution. It is rather like a small boy making little bits of fretwork and hoping that eventually they will form a puzzle. But the Government have no idea what the eventual picture is going to be, and that is our trouble in discussing this legislation. It is an entirely different approach from that which the Government took in 1951. We have the hon. Member from Leominster saying that we should not worry about this Bill because the Government are bound to produce another Bill very shortly, and because this is bound to upset the community of small farmers in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not adequate. I want to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the reasons behind this Amendment. I do not want to enter into the dispute between the Parliamentary Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Hayman). Both are driven to agree that this affects a substantial number of farmers in the country. The Parliamentary Secretary cannot claim that he is going to solve the question of the small farmer by optimistically hoping that he may add 25,000 in the next twelve months. That is the first point, and it is evading the major problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is this. The Parliamentary Secretary has called in aid the White Paper. That says that the Government have been studying this matter, and will continue to do so. I put this challenge to the Parliamentary Secretary. Is he going to give the lie to the White
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
Paper now? All we are asking the Parliamentary Secretary to do is to leave the question open; to say that he has not closed his mind to the difficulties of the smaller farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something for which there is a real responsibility upon the shoulders of the Parliamentary Secretary, because discussions opened years ago with the National Farmers' Union. Those discussions have not reached a satisfactory conclusion, and they must continue. At any rate, let the Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of our discussions upon this Bill, say, " I stand by what I have said in the White Paper, and I will make it quite clear, by accepting this Amendment, that the issue is left open. If I am advised specifically that I can take advantage of this Bill to assist those farmers in one way or another, I will do so."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third argument I put to the Parliamentary Secretary is this. I concede at once that we are very ill-informed about this whole problem. It is difficult to be dogmatic about it, of course. But it would appear that parts of our countryside can be farmed only in this way, and that this is the most economical and profitable way of farming them. There are parts of Britain where farming is necessarily a part-time employment, because that enables the farmer to do his casual employment, other than essential work, which must be carried on in the neighbourhood. One of my hon. Friends mentioned road men. In fact, there are parts of Britain in which this is the only way in which we can get road men. That is the only way in which land in such parts of Britain can be farmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further reason is that the farming of such land is often complementary. I do not want to traverse the ground of forestry again, but it is the case that the casual employment is profitable on the larger farms. It may be that the most profitable way of doing this is to have a man part-time so that he can work on his own holding when work is not available on the adjoining farms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has just occurred to me that two years ago the present chairman of the Cornwall branch of the National Farmers' Union had to congratulate an employee who captured the prize for a bacon pig in a competition which was open to all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask my hon. Friend to forgive me, because I do not go the whole way with him in his strictures upon the National Farmers' Union. I agree with him that its reference to the hobby farmer was unfortunate, but I am charitable enough to think that it was misguided. I would remind my hon. Friend that whatever he thinks of the National Farmers' Union, they are behind him in these Amendments. The point I should like to call in aid from the National Farmers' Union is this. It says that the part-time farmers
	<br><blockquote><p>" may be the very men of limited means but sterling calibre who regard this as the lower rung of the ladder to the occupancy of larger full-time farms."</p></blockquote>
They are the sort of people we should seek to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would put a further argument to the Parliamentary Secretary which is not unimportant. It is this. He will be aware that there have been several studies of the way in which price support affects different categories of farmers. There is not the slightest doubt, surprising though it may seem, that the farmers of marginal land receive less than their fair share of the price support. This is the way in which the prices work out. It is an accepted fact, and we cannot bilk it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary is going to load upon their shoulders—that is, the marginal farmers, who already receive less than other farmers from the pool of price support—the cost of this discriminatory support which is quite properly given to other categories of small farmers. This is a serious matter, and I do not think it is unfair to say that, as far as we can see this scheme operating, it is deliberately envisaged to drive these men to the wall. We have had no response to the plea made by the hon. Member for Leominster, that we ought to have some sort of promise from the Government that they will take further action. If this is a consequence which the Government envisaged, it is a matter which ought to have urgent consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an extraordinarily difficult problem, and I would not like to be dogmatic about it for a moment. I do not think any of us are sufficiently well informed about the position of the small and the marginal farmer and the steps we ought to take. We recognise that this will bring some comfort to some small farmers',
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
but we are concerned about the others. We are not putting forward any proposals or solutions, but we say that the Bill will affect those farmers detrimentally. The Government have offered no comfort to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do no more than to make it quite clear that he is not closing the door against those farmers. I am not asking him to satisfy the hon. Member for Leominster that he has any proposals to make. All I am asking him to do—because this is a matter which has caused a good deal of concern to the smaller farmers—is to accept this Amendment to this enabling Bill. It does not affect the proposals which he makes in the White Paper at all, but it does mean that he is giving an earnest that the Government have given consideration to this matter and believe that they will be able to take steps which will help those small farmers excluded from the present scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister could not answer my question about how far this affects a considerable area in Scotland. That enforces my previous arguments that there should be a special Bill for Scotland. I would ask the noble Lord the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland if he could tell us how this Bill would operate, and why he is opposed to this Amendment as it affects large areas of Western Scotland. The Minister regretted the absence of the hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) from this Committee. I regret the absence of hon. Members representing large areas of Northern Scotland—the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. N. McLean) and the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. John McLeod)—and the outer islands. All seem to be barred from this Committee, so I have to speak for these wide areas and put the questions they would put if they were here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan) is with the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan) knows my point quite well. Both he and I represent what are regarded as mostly lowland areas, with large-scale agriculture. I think he will agree with me—and perhaps
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
this is the only point on which he will agree—that, for the purposes of our discussion this morning, it would be a good thing if we had the experience of some of the hon. Members representing parts of Western Scotland, whose agriculture is rather different from ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of these hon. Members I should like to ask the noble Lord, who has probably got the answers, why he opposes this Amendment when it would fulfil the purposes of the Bill in certain areas of the Western Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In Scotland we have a large number of islands where there is a crofting population. I should like to know why he shuts the door. An hon. Member on this side of the Committee said he wanted to shut the door. Why should he shut the door on various applications which might come from Skye, Lewis, the Hebrides, and from Orkney and Shetland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to enumerate the number of islands in Scotland, because it would take a considerable time. But I do suggest that here is a problem which is important, and one which requires some clarification. We have the same part-time problem as exists in Wales, because in many respects our farms are similar to those of North Wales. We have high land and the sea.

Take the case of the fisherman or the crofter. There is in Scotland a good deal of criticism of the farming population by the seafaring population because the fisherman has sometimes been very jealous of the subsidy to the farmer. That psychology is understandable. We would be making the Bill more useful if some provision were allowed for the farmer who spends some of his time at sea and during whose absence his wife works on his land?

In the Amendment we are seeking to make the Bill operative with a certain amount of imagination. We do not ask, and I am not in favour of asking, for a rigid application of the idea of small-scale farming. It too often means slavery for the small farmer and for his wife and children. But in the Western Islands there is the problem of the man who goes out to sea but who has a small farm which might be quite useful and worth developing. This man may be a part-time worker, either at sea or in forestry,

or, for some time of the year, at the local hotel. Why should he be excluded from the Bill? In this part of Scotland farming is very different from what it is in East and South Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Amendment were accepted there would be a little less rigidity in the Bill which might ease the noble Lord's problems and the problems of his Department at a future date. It would at least provide his Department with a certain latitude to help small farmers who might conceivably be doing a useful job in agriculture, but who might be engaged also in some other work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord John Hope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It taught help if I answered the hon. Member now because he has asked the question which is probably in the minds of quite a lot of people in Scotland who have not had time to go deeply into the Bill. It is a simple answer. A crofter on croft-ling tender comes entirely within the crofting Acts under the Crofters Commission. He is looked after by legislation introduced especially for himself. Anybody outside that legislation can tank for help under this scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about a small farmer who might not be in one of the crofting counties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about this phrase " full time occupation " in respect of a man who is working on a farm of over 20 acres. It is well known that there are many forms of employment required by the State which would not be taken if the men concerned could not have farms in the area. This applies even to postmen in rural areas. We would not get a postman in many of these areas unless there was a small unit he could farm.

We have heard of hobby farming. I was interested in the reference made by my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Hayman) to helping " the rich man in his castle ". In the other place on Wednesday, 5th November, a noble Lord gave a series of figures. He is a noble Viscount from the North of Scotland and he has 19
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
small farms. He gave a full analysis of how, by manipulating the crops on the standards laid down in the White Paper, by cutting out certain crops and putting in others, he could get a business grant for the whole of these 19 farms. I doubt very much if he is the full-time farmer of all his 19 farms. But by the manipulation of the crops, since he controls the farms, he can set the standards for these individual farmers and claim individual grants for each of the nineteen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The small farmer on a unit of 20 acres or so cannot manipulate his crops because the unit is too small and therefore will not be able to come within this scheme. Yet this noble Lord, controlling 19 farms can manipulate——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is in his castle and has worked out that by manipulation of crops he can change crops with man-days which total over 450.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt, but it may help to finalise the hon. Gentleman's argument if I do.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the noble Lord is going to answer this problem. Many of the smallholders in Scotland will not be able to manipulate their crops to come within the 250 to 450 man-days and the individual crofter will not be able to get a grant, whereas this noble Lord is confident that he is going to get a grant for 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord in the other place went on to talk about cattle and cows and calves. He gave the figures. He may not be a full-time farmer. I think he must be a chartered accountant or a banker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Would it be in order, Mr. Diamond, to elucidate the argument by mentioning the noble Lord's name?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into much detail. The name of the noble Lord is Viscount Stonehaven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine so because a lot of figures reveal that he is dealing with raisers of fatstock and breeders of cattle, and I imagine that most of the people he mentioned have heavy overdrafts because he proved that many of them incurred losses.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will eliminate these words " full-time employment". In agriculture, when these matters are discussed in rural communities, notwithstanding what the Minister says, this will be used against the part-time worker of a smallholding. It may be that a man controlling a group of holdings can create viability for them by manipulating the crops between them and so qualify for the grant, but the man who is making a great contribution with certain crops may not be able to produce the crops which come within the White Paper definition of man-days. A crop such as turnips with a low total of man-days may be more valuable to the general agricultural production than a crop with a high allocation of man-days. The man may be able to give a valuable crop but unable to work full-time, and so will not come up to 250 man-days.

This is a very serious matter. The hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin), who is a farmer, will agree that whenever one cultivates the earth, one contributes to the country's general pool of foodstuffs, and that is very valuable. To insist on a requirement that the standard should

be so many man-days will work against the individual small farmer and in favour of the man controlling a group of small farms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who will make the application for grant, "the rich man in his castle ", or " the poor man at his gate "?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a hypothetical question which will be dealt with when it arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary said that the term
	<br><blockquote><p>" and as a full-time occupation ",</p></blockquote>
which we seek to delete does not mean that full-time occupation is necessary. Be said that the definition would apply if the total time worked came to 250 man-days. However, anyone reading those words would be led to believe that a man who was not working a holding as a full-time occupation would not qualify for grant. The Parliamentary Secretary said that that was not correct and that if a man could bring the time spent on cropping and stocking to an equivalent of 250 man-days, he could get a grant. In that case, why have the words been inserted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that if the phrase ended with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>" a farm business capable of yielding an adequate return to any person carrying it on with reasonable efficiency "</p></blockquote>
that definition would meet the case and that to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>" and as a full-time occupation "</p></blockquote>
means that the occupier must be in full-time occupation, in addition to working with reasonable efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussion of a previous agriculture Measure, the Government took the view that no question of full-time or part-time work arose. Therefore, a definition including the words
	<br><blockquote><p>" and as a full-time occupation "</p></blockquote>
must have a purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union has been completely confused on this issue, as is shown by its circular of 21st November. The N.F.U. was clearly under the impression that it was not the Government's intention to exclude the large part-time holdings of more than 20 acres, but on the union's reading of the Bill, it does exclude such holdings. That is why the circular asks for support for the Amendment which seeks to delete that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
phrase. According to what the Parliamentary Secretary said, the deletion would make no difference to the Government's intention, although he argued that he wanted to retain the phrase because it meant something different from what it appeared to mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either full-time occupation as applied to a holding means full-time occupation, or it does not mean anything. We must have a definition to clarify the issue. If the word " and " was not there, the matter might be clarified, but it seems to me that with the inclusion of " and ", only full-time occupation holdings will qualify-for grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was not with us earlier, but he is now present. Can he say beyond doubt that the term " full-time occupation " does not mean what it meant in the White Paper? Can we be told that it does not mean that, but means a standard of cropping and stocking which could be regarded as full-time occupation and something bringing a return to the smallholder at least equivalent to the wage of a farm worker? There will be such confusion that the Minister will be well advised to accept the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers Union has studied the matter very carefully and believes that the words mean something different from what the Parliamentary Secretary says that they mean. In those circumstances, to get clarity in legislation, the best thing the Minister can do is to accept the Amendment, or to reconsider the matter and later insert words to mean what he wants them to mean, words which the National Farmers Union could clearly understand, since although the Union does not like the Bill, it has said that it will assist in every way possible in its administration. Do the words have any value or not? If they have no value, they may as well be deleted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's fears are groundless. I have checked again from the legal point of view and the Bill as drafted carries out the purposes which the Parliamentary Secretary claimed. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>" and as a full-time occupation "</p></blockquote>
are qualified by:
	<br><blockquote><p>" a farm business capable of yielding an adequate return "</p></blockquote>
or providing full-time occupation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. L. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has used the word " or ". Surely the word is " and ", so that the two things are quite distinct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will check again and if it is not what I mean, I will see that there is an alteration later. However, I am certain that the words carry the interpretation which my hon. Friend described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emphasis is on the farm business and it does not matter what combination of labour is employed. For instance, the actual occupier can apply for assistance and be engaged only part-time, but be so efficient that his output is equivalent to that of a man working full-time. Another man might work part-time, with his wife supplying a share of the labour involved. I hope that that explanation will settle any doubts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
