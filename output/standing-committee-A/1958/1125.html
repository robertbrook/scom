—(SCHEMES FOR GRANTS FOR INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF SMALL FARM BUSINESSES.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frederick Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 7, after " grants ", to insert " or loans ".<br><br>
It may help to expedite our proceedings if I preface my speech with a few general remarks. We did not oppose the Second Reading of the Bill. We recognise that it is a necessary enabling Measure. We recognise, at the same time, that the Bill is specifically drawn to implement the White Paper proposals. We are not very enthusiastic about those proposals; we think that they are open to serious criticisms and are inadequate; but our purpose in discussing the Bill in Committee is to seek to widen its scope.<br><br>
We do not propose to discuss the White Paper proposals, but we hope that the Minister will regard our Amendments sympathetically because their sole purpose is to provide him with wider powers. The White Paper proposals have been boosted for electoral purposes, but I accept them as being no more than a Civil Service scheme to implement the policies of the Government, and to the extent that we refer to them we are merely demonstrating the ways in which we think the Bill as at present drawn is inadequate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that the Minister should have power to make not only grants but loans. There is now a clear division between the two sides of the Committee. Hon. Members on this side have made it clear that they think that the credit facilities afforded to the agricultural industry are inadequate, and they will seek ways and means of extending them. I hope that the Minister will recognise that after the next General Election there will be a change of Government and, therefore, a change of Governmental attitude, and that it is quite legitimate that we should seek not to be inhibited in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord John Hope)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose the hon. Member got that from Aberdeen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trespassing in Scottish affairs.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will concede that this is an enabling Bill, and that it ought not to prevent recourse to the provision of credit facilities. We are not seeking to discuss the White Paper, but I hope that the Minister will leave the matter open, so that we can return to it if necessary and consider the provision of loans.<br><br>
In support of my argument I would repeat that we are not enthusiastic about the present proposals. We do not think that they go far enough, and if the Minister accepts that as a possible criticism of his scheme I should think that he will want to leave open the possibility of making greater provision for loans. I would also remind him that there is a difference of opinion between him and the producers' organisation, the National Farmers' Union, on this point. The Union did not oppose the husbandry grants, but it thought that they should be supplemented by interest-free loans, the interest and the amortisation being a charge on the Price Review.<br><br>
I recognise that the Union was in difficulties in discussing this matter, and naturally wished to lighten the impact of any provision made by the Minister upon the Price Review award. I appreciate that especially in the light of the difficulties which the Union experienced in relation to this year's award, but there are much more substantial arguments in support of the Union's proposals. I am not resting my case upon the ambiguity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0715">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
of the Price Review White Paper, but there is something in the Union's argument, viewed against the background in which farming has been aided over the past few years, that additional finance should be provided. If we consider the farm improvement grants, which we discussed fairly recently, and also have regard to the fact that 80 per cent. of the successful applications so far have been made by owners, and regard this scheme as being largely a tenant matter, we see that there is something in the broad case put forward by the Union that some finance should have been provided outside the Review moneys.<br><br>
There is also something in the argument that the scheme should be underwritten by the State; that the State should obviously have some interest in the continuance and success of the scheme, but I rest my case in support of the Union's proposals upon broader practical grounds. The Union accepts part of the Government's proposals. It accepts the provision of husbandry grants. If those grants are to be successful in achieving the Government's objective, however, much more money may have to be provided, and I should have thought that it could possibly be provided by way of loans. If we regard the scheme in two compartments, the farm business grants will probably be inadequate and ineffective. My right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) referred to this question during the Second Reading debate. Most of us saw John Cherrington's article the other day, in which he made out a very persuasive case against part of the Government's proposals, and said that if they were implemented the small farmer would probably lack the capacity to manage the flush of grass and to provide the stock to eat it. Farm business grants are not sufficient for this purpose.<br><br>
I know that this is a matter which could be argued both ways, but I would remind the Committee that the Report of the Committee on Grass Utilisation seems to support this view. It certainly calls attention to the gaps in credit for the farmers, especially medium-term credit to purchase stock, and long-term credit for tenant farmers. This being so, I would have thought that the Minister would at any rate go so far as to say that he cannot be absolutely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
sure about the proposals that he is making; that it would be wise to provide for the supplementation of any such provision by providing for the possibility of loans, and that loans might well provide the much greater amount of capital which appears to be needed and does not appear to be provided by the present scheme.<br><br>
I also press the Amendment because we cannot be very satisfied about the intentions of the Government. I say that for two reasons. The Minister would concede that this is a short-term scheme. In the light of present Government agricultural policy we naturally suspect that whereas the under-20-acre man is now written off the small farmers who qualify for this scheme will also be written off after it has run out. We should like a more continuing interest in the problem of the small farmer, and all members of the Committee would probably concede that the advantage of loan aid is that it provides that continuing interest.<br><br>
Again, if we turn to the White Paper and see what the Minister has said we cannot feel very satisfied. In anticipation of an Amendment such as this the Minister saw to it that an argument was deployed in paragraph 13, but it is certainly not a very satisfactory presentation of any case there may be against our present proposals. It speaks of loans at normal rates of interest. That is a typical Civil Service line of argument. It is not in issue at the moment. We are talking of loans bearing no interest, or a preferential rate of interest. We are talking of loans which will give some special aid to the small farmer. The White Paper refers to the inability of the Government to add to Exchequer commitments, and says that the Government cannot face a loan fund. This, again, is begging the question. We are here concerned with the question whether the present aid will be adequate, and if this approach in itself is not sufficient we should consider whether we ought to have an alternative approach. If we have to have an alternative to provide a greater measure of aid, the proposals for making loans will be a less heavy burden than the providing of further grants.<br><br>
The White Paper rather gives the case away by saying that the Government hope that as a result of these proposals the small farmers will find it easier to obtain extra credit. We, too, hope that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0716">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
will. It is for that reason that we are making proposals about credit, but if the small farmers are to be more creditworthy the Government ought to provide for the possibility of giving credit in respect of such schemes as they have in mind under the White Paper.<br><br>
The Minister himself did not seem to be so optimistic about this matter. I would remind him that when questioned upon the subject of the provision of loams he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The sort of chap whom we are trying to help is not the sort of chap who likes to have loans, and I shall be very sorry for any successor of mine who tried to get the money back."</p></blockquote>
That is a revelation of the purposes of the scheme. It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the scheme may well be the second phase in writing off small farmers. We are anxious that this attitude should not obtain.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Hon. Members on this side of the Committee believe credit to be one of the essential needs of the agriculture industry. We cannot accept the argument, as apparently the Minister is putting it, that the small farmer is not the sort of person who will seek credit. It is one of our major purposes to see that by one means or another we encourage a reliance upon credit.<br><br>
The observation of the Minister that he would be sorry for a successor of his who tried to get the money back gives the lie to the whole scheme. We earnestly hope that the small farmer will become creditworthy. For that reason we also hope that the Minister will not reject this Amendment, or be carried away by the enthusiastic support he has received from the <i>Economist</i>, which stated that his scheme displayed some degree of toughness. That is high praise from the <i>Economist</i>, but it is disturbing to anyone interested in the agriculture industry.<br><br>
I am not asking the Minister to accept all the arguments which I have advanced in favour of this Amendment. I am asking him to accept that there is a need and that it is desirable for small farmers to resort to aid which can be given by means of credit. This is an enabling Bill. I hope, therefore, that whatever may be the mind of the Minister at present he will not rule out the possibility of providing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
credit but, on the contrary, will indicate that he is not unfavourably disposed towards the provision of credit to small farmers or others in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sidney Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is undoubtedly a difference of view between hon. Members on each side of the Committee of the terms of this Amendment. It would appear to me that the Minister has put himself in grave difficulty because, on the question of loans to small farmers, he made the statement, already quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey), that he would be sorry for those who had to try to get the money back. If that is the extent of his confidence in the small farmer, it is very small indeed. If that represents the extant of the right hon. Gentleman's belief in the future of the small farmer, then that future is limited. The question arises, if the Government have no faith in the future of the small farmers of this country, why give them grants?<br><br>
Our point is that if grants are necessary, so also are the loans which are not at present available to small farmers on a sufficiently large scale. If anyone is to consider helping the small farmers by discussing cropping and their business arrangements, and so on, with the idea of the Government providing grants to assist them, why not at the same time discuss still larger improvements to small holdings which might be carried out by means of loans? The Government are saying that if this matter is dealt with by way of grants and loans, the two sources of money should be provided by separate departments—grants from Whitehall and loans from Lombard Street or somewhere else, wherever farmers can get them in the easiest way—and probably at the highest interest rates. In my opinion, that is a great flaw in the scheme.<br><br>
The other day I questioned the Minister on the matter of loans to statutory smallholders. I was told that by 31st September last 1,225 advances had been approved, totalling £1,119,837. In 44 cases special steps had been taken to recover the payments which were overdue. I do not know how long a period is covered, but it would appear to me that those 44 cases represent only about 3 per cent. or 3½ per cent. of the advances. Apparently, therefore, the Minister is basing his opposition to the idea of loans on the fact that there were 3½ per cent.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0717">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
of failures. That is indeed a very small proportion. The question to which the Minister should apply himself is, what advantage accrued to the other 96½ per cent. who also received loans?<br><br>
Those county council smallholders have done their work effectively and efficiently, but could they have done it as well without these advances being made available to them? Who were the men to whom this money was made available? They were men with known experience in agriculture and with ability. They had been approved by a committee of the small holdings committee. They represent the very type of man who ought to have assistance. They possess the knowledge and ability necessary to manage a small farm, but they lack capital. This scheme has proved a success when applied to statutory smallholdings. I agree that it is a limited success but we are asking that the assistance be made available to other smallholders who do not come under the county council, but are tenants.<br><br>
The Minister has put himself in the wrong, I think, in asserting that his reasons for not granting a loan is that the people who receive such loans will not, or may not, be able to repay them. I should have thought a scheme could be worked out which would enable a small farmer to make use of such a loan, and repay both capital and interest, in such a way as to enable him to extend his business and make it more profitable. Then he would be in a better position not only to repay the loan, but to conduct his farm more efficiently.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) said during the Second Reading debate that a small farmer with 20 acres could expect a maximum of £120 spread over four payments by way of grant. What improvements can a small farmer make towards improving the profitability of his holding on receipt of four separate grants, unless at the same time he is able to increase his stock? It would be no advantage to him to improve his grassland unless he could increase the stock to consume the extra grass, and produce more beef and milk, or some other commodity, which he could sell at a profit. So that, in addition to a grant to improve his grassland, a small farmer must receive aid to enable him to purchase more stock.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
If the Minister argues that there are credit facilities available which would enable a farmer to increase his stock by means of hire-purchase, my reply is that the interest rates are so high that I would not recommend a small farmer to use such a method to increase his stock; and I do not think that the Minister should do so.<br><br>
There is a further aspect which I consider of importance. If a small farmer who wishes to increase his stock is left to his own devices, he will increase the production of eggs, milk, pork and bacon, because they are the easiest commodities to produce and require less capital. They involve the expenditure of a certain amount of time and the provision of some initial loan or extra money. In that way a farmer can increase the number of his poultry or pigs or add another cow to his herd and increase his milk yield.<br><br>
I asked earlier what was the purpose of this Bill from the point of view of increased production. Was it intended just to enable a small farmer to produce more of such commodities as eggs, milk, bacon and pork of which there might be a surplus at present? Or was the idea—and this I think would be a better conception—to enable the small farmer to produce other commodities which might be in short supply because of importing difficulties and of which this country might find itself short in the next few years? Beef is a good example.<br><br>
What would a small farmer need to enable him to rear more cattle for the production of beef as against milk production or pigs and poultry? He would require more capital to enable him to increase his production of those commodities which the nation needs. I speak from practical experience. I am a small farmer, although I do not come within this scheme. I have only 80 acres; therefore, on an average basis. I should come in; but on man-days per year I am a long way out because I am not producing those commodities about which there is difficulty. I am producing beef on a comparatively large scale. To do that a small farmer must have far more capital than is necessary to rear poultry and pigs.<br><br>
At present I have on my holding 52 beef cattle which would probably be valued at between £60 and £70 each. A small farmer with a limited amount of capital cannot do what may be done by a small farmer who has the necessary

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
capital. Each year I have to pay £3,000 to £4,000 for store cattle to fatten on my farm. If a small farmer desired to go in for rearing calves, he would have to have the cows in order to produce the calves, or he must be able to buy calves and keep them for a period before he can resell them. The proposed grants will not enable any small farmer to increase his beef production. He cannot do that by means of £120 or £220 spread over four instalments. It will enable him to improve his grassland, and probably to increase his production of other crops, but it will not enable him to improve the animal side of his husbandry. And the cost in interest rates from other sources of credit are so high as to make that avenue unprofitable.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
I speak as a practical small farmer, and I say without hesitation that this scheme, without adequate credit facilities in addition to grants, will be of very little value to our small farmers. The Minister's view seems to be, " Well, the small farmers seem to be such a poor financial proposition that if they had loans they could not repay them." That view shows very little confidence in the future of the small farmers. Or, of course, it may be a long-term forecast of the Conservative Party's attitude towards agriculture, that there will not be a future for the man with ability but without the capital necessary to extend his production so as to make his holding comparable in efficiency with that achieved by the Danes, the Dutch and others with experience of this sort of thing.<br><br>
From our knowledge of what has taken place in Denmark, we know that that country could not have become a leading bacon-producing country had not the basis of its system been grounded in the past on credit facilities that were good and easy. Those facilities must be available all the way along, and I do not think that we can look at the progress made by small farmers in other countries without returning to the conclusion that progress has been made, not only by the farmers' knowledge of their job but by the added amount of loans made available to them at the vital time of the development of their holdings. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
was the basis of the progress made years ago in Ireland.<br><br>
It is for that reason that I say that if the efficiency of our small farms is to be brought up to the level of that of any other country in the world, and comparable with that of our large farms, the proper way to go about it is to give the farmers the capital. That is particularly so of the younger men, those below 50, who have a number of years before them. They want so to set out their farms as to promote better and more efficient management. Instead of these comparatively small driblets of grants, small as compared with the grants given to the bigger farmers, we should put into operation, in conjunction with the banks, with other financial institutions, the county agricultural executive committees and the district committees, some system such as that I have suggested. On that basis, this scheme could be made a real success.<br><br>
Quite recently, I have come across a number of cases where bank managers have asked certain very efficient farmer customers to look at some of their neighbours with big overdrafts, and to recommend how those less efficient farmers should change their methods of production so as to make profits. That is the kind of thing that we should like to see put into operation on the smaller farms, with men of known business ability working through the county and district agricultural committees, with the added power to provide this essential element of credit.<br><br>
If that were done, this scheme could be made a success. Without it, I do not think that it can. Without it, the scheme will be just a short-term business in which, to use the Minister's phrase yet again—and he must expect to have it cast back at him—we are having just a little flutter now, but the credit future seems a little dim for these people.<br><br>
We have avoided stipulating the rate of interest. The National Farmers' Union recommended no interest charges in certain cases. Personally, I have never asked for anything for nothing, and would not do so now. I believe that people should be prepared to pay for what they receive, whether it is credit, or other facilities. In this case, however, the interest rates need to be small, the period limited, and the guidance of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
agricultural executive committees should be available.<br><br>
I am convinced that that is the first vital improvement that the Minister ought to make in his Bill. He ought not to take the attitude, " The Conservative Party has considered this, and this is as far as we can go. We have not much time to consider anything else, because we want it put into operation quickly." Instead of that, it is far better to spend a little more time in so improving the Bill as to make it a credit to the House, a credit to the Minister, and a credit to the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir James Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not vote for the Amendment, for reasons that I shall give. Reference has been made to the small farmer's problem in getting capital, and the Amendment raises the question of whether or not the Government should give the credit directly. I shall not vote for the Amendment, because I do not think that the Government are the right people to give the loans. They will get into frightful difficulties if they have to investigate the credit worthiness of small farmers. One has only to remember the grants given to the farmers, large and small, after the First World War, and the enormous amount lost by the taxpayers as a result of grants being made to un-creditworthy farmers, to see the difficulties in which the Government would be were they themselves to embark on this business of loans.<br><br>
It is true that the provisions of this Bill do or should increase the creditworthiness of small farmers; but only for five years. Here, I should say that I am not speaking on behalf of Scottish farmers. I have had no information, criticism or anything else from the Scottish National Farmers' Union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have given the hon. Gentleman up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking entirely for myself, and I will give my experience. My experience is that no great advantage of husbandry grants is likely to be taken in Scotland because, broadly speaking, that side is pretty efficient already. It will not be easy to enter into a scheme for improving the land, because the land, too, is pretty efficient already.<br><br>
I believe that the snag will arise over buildings, and here we have to divide
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
those concerned into tenant farmers and owner-occupiers, and I will take the owner-occupier first. Under the scheme, the maximum amount of grant is £350, to be used over a period of five years for a loan from a bank or from some other body. For the improvement of buildings, that term will not be long enough. For that purpose, the average loan is generally expected to be for 10 years or even longer, whether the lending authority is a bank, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation—or, in Scotland, the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation. They might get a lien of £6 an acre for five years, but what is to happen after that? The difficulty is that although we are improving the creditworthiness of the farmer, that creditworthiness may not continue after the receipt of the grant.<br><br>
Then there is the tenant of the small farm. I suppose that where landowners improve the buildings on small farms, they can expect an increased rent. That is fair enough. They have to get the money somewhere, and will have to go to some credit institution for it. Where do they come in on this? There is no specially increased creditworthiness for the landlord except, possibly, in the increased value of the farm. I can see a difficulty arising there first, of the tenant farmer's inducing the landlord to spend, and, secondly, of the landlord's obtaining the capital on such terms as to make it a business proposition for him to improve the holding.<br><br>
I should like to see the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation much less remote, and much more speedy in dealing with loan applications. I have heard complaints that it is too slow, and too remote. In the case of tenant holdings, little or nothing can be done, because, in Scotland, we have the peculiar system under which money can be lent only on property and not on movable equipment. There is there a real problem, and the Government must look at it.<br><br>
Admittedly, this Measure will give a great deal of help, but it will not do everything. I disagree with the Amendment because I think that here it is wrong to make the Government lend the money, but there is a credit problem here which would be better solved by a speedier and more humane approach to loan applications than that at present shown either by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0720">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation in England, or by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation in Scotland.<br><br>
The bankers are willing to help on the short term, but there still remains the problem of long-term loans for buildings. I hope that the Government will look at that problem very carefully, and do what they can to improve the situation. I do not believe that they should do it directly; but, indirectly, if this scheme is to work, they have an obligation to deal with this question of capital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks carefully at the Clause, I think that he will find himself in agreement with the Amendment. The amended Clause would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"The appropriate Minister may … provide for the payment of grants or loans …"</p></blockquote>
The essential words are " provide for the payment ". If the Amendment were accepted, I envisage the Government having all the powers that the hon. Gentleman wishes them to have. We are asking that the Government should have powers to provide for the payment—not necessarily themselves to make the payment direct. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will be consistent, and support us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) is a legal gentleman, and I am only a layman. I read the Amendment as seeking an extension of the Government's powers to make loans, and I think that that is the right reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. John Hare)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will forgive me for intervening now but, as I have already explained to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams), I have to go to a Cabinet meeting, and I do not wish to appear discourteous to the Committee by not giving my own views during this very important debate.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) put his proposals, if I may say so, with good humour, with calm, and with a good deal of persuasion. I hope that he will not be disappointed when I say quite clearly and at once that, although I appreciate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
the very cogent arguments put forward as far, I cannot accept the Amendment.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I cannot accept the Amendment, very much for the reasons I gave in my Second Reading speech, and very much for the reasons given in Paragraph 13 of the White Paper, but also because, as a result of the very detailed and open-minded study we have given, we think that it would not be practicable to use loans as a method of assistance in the Small Farmer Scheme. I thought the hon. Gentleman was a little unfair when he suggested that Paragraph 13 stated that the Government hoped that the improvements to farm businesses that will now be open to many small farmers will make them more creditworthy. It is quite clear that what the White Paper says is that
<br><blockquote><p>" the improvements to farm businesses that will now be open to many small farmers will make them more credit-worthy and will therefore make it easier for them to obtain extra credit from normal sources, if that is needed as well as the grants."</p></blockquote>
I have had my leg pulled somewhat by the hon. Gentleman, and also by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) who made a very interesting and constructive speech. I have had my leg pulled, because I was saying that I should be very sorry for any future Minister of Agriculture who had to collect the money, supposing it was possible for the Government to give loans rather than grants to small farmers coming into this scheme.<br><br>
Personally, I feel that, as I have said in the House in the raising of money by loans, the particular type of farmer we are trying to help, instinctively cautious, as they are at the moment, would be very hesitant in coming forward. If I am correct, and I believe I am, the object and purpose of the scheme would be negatived, because many of the people whom we want to help would not be prepared to go forward and take advantage of the scheme. I see the complications. Suppose that they did go forward, rather unwillingly, to take advantage of the scheme, to find, perhaps, that they were not as successful as many of their brothers would be. If asked for repayment over a number of years, they might say that the advice which they got from the Ministry's officials was quite wrong, and that they could not see why they Should have to pay back money because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0721">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
the scheme, as far as they were concerned, had not been very successful. It is not that I have any fears that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite will be responsible for the Ministry of Agriculture for many years to come, but I feel that I have to make that point quite clear.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Norfolk, Southwest tried to say that I had no faith in the small farmer, because I did not believe that he would repay the loans, and, therefore, why did I introduce the scheme. I have tremendous faith in the small farmer, as I think the hon. Gentleman Knows, but what I think is vital is to tell him how to make his farm more profitable by giving him grants and advice, rather than to saddle him initially with a loan before he has become more creditworthy.<br><br>
I could not sympathise or agree more with my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Sir. J. Duncan), who said that he was worried lest there was a need possibly for more credit, but did not feel that the Government were the right agents. He made the point that, on the whole, the Ministry's advisory officers, who will have to do the vetting of the schemes, are not the best people to assess the creditworthiness of individual farmers and that, I think, is a very sound point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do the people get these grants without any inquiries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hare</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman knows that a detailed programme of improvements will have to be worked out in each case, and so he is not on a good point there.<br><br>
There is tremendous difficulty in assessing creditworthiness for loans on a large scale, and there is, therefore, a need for some limitation to the scheme. Quite frankly, excellent and skilful as our advisory officers are in working out plans for improvements for increasing the productivity of a farm, they are not primarily appointed for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that he is in agreement with his hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan), but did he not hear him say that these loans could be made available to farmers through such instruments as the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
and the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation? Are not both these bodies instruments of the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hare</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) was listening as carefully as I was to my hon. Friend. He was expressing concern about medium- and long-term credit. I shall not venture into this as the Scottish body does not come under my purview, but we have in England the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, and my hon. Friend was expressing the hope that it would act more quickly and be prepared to give loans for buildings and fixed equipment. I agree with him and I hope the Corporation will act far more quickly.<br><br>
As far as England and Wales are concerned, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation has informed me of the many steps it is taking to speed up the procedure. It has proclaimed, as I said on Second Reading, that it is interested in the very matter my hon. Friend mentioned; it is providing loans for buildings which are being erected under farm improvement schemes. Therefore, it is no surprise to hon. Members that I should agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus said.<br><br>
If I could now pick up one or two other points raised by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Sunderland, North, may I refer to the point he made, when asking me to include loans in these provisions, that there was likely to be a change in the Government, perhaps within the next twelve months? He said it would be very mean if I should not provide the weapon which the Opposition would like to use, supposing that they became responsible for the scheme. I do not think that we ought to legislate for purely hypothetical and very unlikely circumstances.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also made the point that the N.F.U. wanted interest-free loans, but the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West, very frankly, as always, said that he does not agree with that. He said that he does not believe that anybody should get things for nothing, but that what he called reasonable rates of interest should be charged. I imagine that his hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North shared his view on that point.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0722">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Minister does not wish to be unfair to the N.F.U. As I understand its proposals, the interest charges and amortisation would be borne by the Price Review award. The N.F.U. was not asking that the taxpayer should subsidise this but asking that this charge should be borne by the Price Review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hare</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says is perfectly true. I took his words down, and he said the N.F.U. wanted interest-free loans. What he is now saying is correct, that ratio of interest should be charged but should come within the scope of the Price Review. I hope I have established the fact that the party opposite would not favour interest-free loans, but would favour loans at reasonable rates of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having said that, the Minister must now acknowledge that we are not asking him to give something to the small farmers under this scheme. It is not that the Government are being asked to give, but that they are being asked to provide the means whereby, at reasonable rates of interest, these small farmers can have made available to them credit which is not at present available to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hare</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is continuing the theme of the hon. Gentleman's speech. I was trying to make it clear that the view of the Opposition is that there should not be interest-free loans.<br><br>
I have said, both in my Second Reading speech and in subsequent speeches, that, cogent as some of these arguments are, the arguments which I have put forward why we cannot agree to the proposition which is being put forward are even stronger. I thought the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West was a little unfair in assuming that interest rates are too high. I think that the latest reduction in Bank Rate means that it would be possible for small farmers, who had become more creditworthy and who wished to avail themselves of the facilities provided by the banks will probably be able to do so at quite reasonable rates of interest. The hon. Gentleman was not quite fair when he used a phrase about grants from Whitehall and loans from Lombard Street. There are available to farmers loans from their own local bank managers, which is the normal source of short-term credit, and I have referred to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
the means for increasing facilities for medium-term and longer-term credit, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a most important point. Does not the Minister realise that though the Bank Rate has now come down, it was quite recently as high as 7 per cent., and that, indeed, small farmers were paying 8 per cent.? What guarantee is there that if a farmer took a loan at 4 per cent. the rate of interest would not be raised very soon to 8 per cent.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hare</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about short-term credit, and when the hon. Gentleman buys his 52 bullocks a year, he borrows on a short-term basis, I hope, if he does have to borrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: " Neither a borrower nor a lender be."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hare</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fine. That is a very fortunate position in which to be.<br><br>
I have dealt with most of the main points which have been put forward by the three hon. Gentlemen who have, I think, made valuable contributions to the debate, but I would still repeat the three main arguments why I have said that it would be wrong for the Committee to accept the Amendment. First of all, I believe that we are dealing with a type of farmer, many of whom do not at this stage, before their farms have become more productive, wish to incur loan charges on their farms. Secondly, I believe that my advisory officers, who would be responsible for assessing the creditworthiness of farmers, are not trained for that purpose, and, therefore, would not make as good a job as one would like to see them make of it. Thirdly, I am quite convinced that the small farmer, once he has started his improvement scheme and has begun to increase the productivity of his farm, will then become more creditworthy, and will therefore he more prepared to accept loans for further expansion.<br><br>
I believe that the facilities for short-term credit will be available to him through his own local bank manager, and I believe that medium-term and longer-term credit can largely be made available by the willingness of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, certainly in England and Wales, to enter that field and give the services which may be demanded of it.</span></p>

<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's speech illustrates that dangerous practice which has now become prevalent in our agricultural legislation of tacking Scotland on to England. The Minister, conscious that he knew very little about Scotland, said that it was not within his purview. However, he did not wisely leave the matter to the noble Lord the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, whom we all recognise as an expert on agriculture.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman quoted from the hon. Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan) and he seemed to take for granted that the hon. Member speaks for agriculture and farming opinion in Scotland. This is a complete delusion, because the hon. Member said that he had had no communication at all from the National Farmers' Union of Scotland. I do not know whether the hon. Member adopts Lord Nelson's policy and puts the telescope to his blind eye, says that he cannot see a signal, and does not read communications from the Scottish National Farmers' Union. An hon. Member should at least be in touch with the people whom he represents, but apparently the hon. Member for South Angus has had no communication with the Union at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was in touch with the Angus area of the National Farmers' Union yesterday and its officials had nothing to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be because the branch has given the hon. Member up, knowing that when we last discussed a Bill to help the small farmers he spoke not for the farmers but for the landlords. Again on this Bill he has asked where the landlords come in, and arrangements for the benefit of the landlords were made in previous legislation. Certainly, if I were a South Angus farmer I should not bother to write to the hon. Member. I should write to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire. The proceedings on this and the previous Measure have completely exploded any theory that hon. Members opposite speak for the farmers. Fundamentally, they speak for the landlords and not for agriculture at all.<br><br>
It is rather curious that the National Farmers' Union of Scotland has issued a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
very interesting and detailed statement on exactly this point. Even if the hon. Member for South Angus does not read communications from the N.F.U. of Scotland he should at least read the <i>Scottish Farmer.</i> It should be the duty of any hon. Member who professes to represent an agricultural constituency to keep in touch with the people he is supposed to represent. If the hon. Member for South Angus had read the <i>Scottish Farmer</i> as diligently as you do, Mr. Diamond, and I commend that paper as an organ of interesting and authoritative opinion——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the <i>Scottish Farmer</i> had something relevant to say on the subject of loans?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, in the last issue but one. The question of an interest-free loan was raised on the front page of that issue. I do not ask the hon. Member for South Angus to read the whole paper but only the first article on the first page.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not even on the circulation list of that paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not on its circulation list either, but as a Member representing a great many farmers I believe that I should take an interest at least in their opinions when a Bill affecting small farmers comes before us. I do it altruistically. I do not expect many of them to vote for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But that, of course, is not in the Bill.<br><br>
The position relating to loans is explained in the latest circular from the National Farmers Union of Scotland, issued on 31st October last. Perhaps the hon. Member for South Angus has not got through his correspondence for October yet, and perhaps this debate will result in his being placed on the mailing list of the N.F.U. of Scotland. If there is any doubt about this matter I am sure that the noble Lord the Joint Under-Secretary will be able to inform the hon. Member. I am sure that the noble Lord reads the communications from the N.F.U. and the <i>Scottish Farmer</i> as well. I am sorry to be so long in introducing my argument, but it is absolutely essential, after a speech by the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0724">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
South Angus, to clear the rubbish before one gets to the point. One has to clear a site before one builds a house.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all rubbish up to now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's agricultural constituents will be interested to hear that.<br><br>
The statement in the N.F.U. circular reads:
<br><blockquote><p>" There is general agreement that the method of helping the smaller farmer should be by the provision of additional capital. The Union do not think that the Government's scheme is the most effective way of achieving that end, and they would have preferred to see the field husbandry grants supplemented by generous re-payable grants for capital purposes instead of the out and out business grant with a maximum of £360 favoured by the Government. The re-payable grants would have been interest-free loans in effect …"</p></blockquote>
I agree with the National Farmers Union of Scotland on this issue and not with my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye).<br><br>
The statement continues:
<br><blockquote><p>" and the Union think that a much more effective, flexible and economical scheme could have been worked out on these lines. The Government's proposals do not measure up to the basic need for capital—a need which varies tremendously between one farm and another."</p></blockquote>
I hope that we have from the Minister representing agriculture in Scotland a reasonable reply to this statement by the Scottish farmers' organisation. I think that I have established that agricultural opinion in Scotland is in favour of interest-free loans. If hon. Members are interested in the argument they can follow it up in that issue of the <i>Scottish Farmer</i>, which is in the Library.<br><br>
I cannot understand the hon. Member for South Angus saying that if the Government gave these loans they would have to investigate. Surely, they would have to investigate anyhow, and surely the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation investigates before it gives farmers loans. Nobody in the banking fraternity gives anything for nothing. If banks are generous they are not generous with their own money. They lend the money because they are guaranteed repayment by the Government.<br><br>
Neither can I understand the hon. Member for South Angus saying that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Government should not give loans because some farmers may default. It may be true that over a wide area some might default. Under the present scheme some farmers will default and not make good. Surely, over the large area of small farms in England and Scotland we are bound to have some farmers who will not make good under the provisions of the Bill, but it does not follow that this is not a business proposition.<br><br>
Anybody who goes into business, whether in agriculture or trade of any kind, must make allowance for bad debts, but the possibility of some small bad debts does not constitute an argument against the Amendment. I am sure that there will be investigations galore under this scheme to ensure that Government money is not spent uselessly. No Scottish farmer will expect a Government inspector to call and give him money for nothing. I, therefore, support the idea of a loan, because it is the considered opinion of the farmers' organisations and the people whom I represent that there should be a loan.<br><br>
The Amendment does not say that there should be interest-free loans, though I would have been prepared to table an Amendment to that effect. Here I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West. I believe in the principle that in this world and in our present economy we cannot agree to someone getting something for nothing. I entirely agree that that idea is not in our political outlook, but my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West forgets that sometimes the Government have to give an interest-free loan in order to look ahead and build up an industry. Over and over again, in different branches of the national economy, the Government have come along with subsidies which are in fact interest-free loans.<br><br>
If the Government's basic argument about the need to revive small farming in the national economy is true, the Government should adopt this modest Amendment. It is not what I and the Scottish farmers would have proposed, because it asks for loans and not for interest-free loans. I can understand the argument of an hon. Member who draws attention to the high rate of interest. If a Scottish farmer were to be saddled with an interest of 8 per cent., as was the case with a previous Measure, it would be an enormous burden. I do not know whether the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0725">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
noble lord the Joint Under-Secretary will come forward to say that he is the champion of the small farmer against the money-lenders.<br><br>
If the Government think that the interest rate is too high, and if that is why they oppose a loan, their policy should be to bring in an interest-free loan; and a loan cannot be at a lower rate of interest than nothing per cent. Therefore, this argument does not come from any theoretical Socialist source at all. It comes from overwhelmingly Conservative farmers. I believe that they have made their case and that the Amendment is a reasonable interpretation of that case. It does not go as far as they want, or as far as I would go, but I think that the hon. Member for South Angus should change his mind and vote for this very reasonable Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Archer Baldwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that some of the later Amendments will have my support. This one does not and therefore I should like to notch a credit with the Minister before we come to those later Amendments. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) made a great plea for interest-free loans. The Amendment does not provide for them and therefore I do not suppose that I should be in order to say much about them. I want, however, to protest against any idea that our great agricultural industry should be treated differently from other industries. If small farmers have interest-free loans, why not the small shopkeepers and everybody else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member apply that principle to derating? Why should agriculture in that respect be treated any differentely from other industries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir A. Baldwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We pay rates on houses and buildings, and that is as much as others do. We do not pay rates on our raw material. Nor should we be expected to do so.<br><br>
Agriculture at present gets all the credit it wants if it is worth that credit. Perhaps it is forgotten that an Act was passed, I think in 1928, which enabled farmers to go to the banks and pledge their goods to buy farming stocks against a loan. Many farmers at that time thought it a wonderful idea. They went to the banks and got their loans, and immediately all the credit that they were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
being given by corn merchants, auctioneers and everybody else died up. The result was that the farmer found himself a great deal worse off than he had been before he obtained the loan. For that reason the Act of Parliament, which is still in existence, is practically unused. There is therefore no need for the Amendment. If farmers want to obtain credit they can pledge their farming stock and get it straight away.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
The idea that many small farmers want loans is wrong. The Government will help the farmer by making him more creditworthy, and he can then get all the loans he wants. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye), who carries out beef production, made a claim for credit facilities. He knows quite well that he can go today to the Farmers' Marketing Corporation, which is a farmers' organisation, and obtain credit to buy his store cattle, repaying the Corporation when he sells them. I do not know what more credit he wants. This is his own organisation, and it should be sufficient. If farmers do want more credit they should follow the example of the Danish farmers. In Denmark there is a farmers' co-operative bank, and any farmer who wants credit can obtain it, if he is creditworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where does the bank get the money? The hon. Member said that it is a small farmers' credit bank. The bank would not get it from the small farmer and lend it back to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baldwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is no business of the small farmer where the bank gets the money. The farmer can get the credit, and the other matter does not concern him. The fact remains that there are in existence in Denmark, and I believe also in Holland, co-operative banks which will advance money to farmers if they are creditworthy.<br><br>
The decision whether they are creditworthy rests with the local people, who know whether the farmers concerned are worth while persons. Therefore, if farmers in this country want more credit they should go in for farmers' co-operative banks. I cannot support the Amendment, because I do not think that it is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roderic Bowen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. It is important to remember
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0726">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
that this is an enabling Bill. Clause 1 provides for the introduction of "a scheme or schemes ". I suggest that the Minister is not entitled to reject the Amendment unless he has a completely closed mind on the question of giving loans to farmers.<br><br>
He is not being asked to commit himself permanently to the introduction of a scheme to provide loans; all he is being asked to do is to place himself in a position to introduce a scheme to provide loans, or to embody it in his present proposals to provide grants, if it should appear to him to be necessary after he has had some experience of the working of the present scheme. I am surprised that the Minister does not take this opportunity to widen the scope of the Bill so that when his initial proposals have been in operation and he perhaps finds that the whole idea behind the Bill would be improved by supplementation through loans, he will be able to do it without introducing fresh legislation.<br><br>
The Minister has said that the type of farmer who would take advantage of the Bill and would submit a scheme is not the one who would want to saddle himself with loan charges. That may be true of many farmers, but nobody is suggesting that everyone who submits a scheme will ask for a loan. Many will not want one. It would be quite wrong for the Minister to shut out the possibility of considering loans in conjunction with grants.<br><br>
I associate myself with what has been said about the crippling and damaging effect which the absence of loans might have upon the grant scheme. I do not want to go into this matter in any detail, but it is possible that money given by way of husbandry grants will be wasted if further money is not available, on the farm business side to take full advantage of the improvements in grasslands resulting from the field husbandry grant. It therefore seems that the Minister is making a great mistake in closing his mind completely to the possibility of introducing a loans scheme.<br><br>
The next argument raised by the Minister was that his advisory officers were not equipped to design credit arrangements for small farmers. Nothing is laid down in the Amendment saying that his advisers will have to do this. The people who have to approve a farming scheme
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
might not be the best to approve the granting of credit. If the Minister introduced loans in addition to grants he might have to have a different scheme, with different administrative machinery. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that; indeed, the Bill envisages more than one scheme, because it talks about " a scheme or schemes." I see no reason why suitable machinery should not be provided for operating a loans scheme.<br><br>
The Minister also said that there would ,be no need for loans or credit facilities, because the credit of the small farmers would be so much improved by the implementation of the grant scheme. I do not want to disparage the scheme; I believe that it will do good to many small farmers; but the effect that it will have upon their credit facilities in the next few years will be very small. We are talking in terms of a grant of £360 over a period of three years in respect of farm business. What effect will that have on the credit facilities of a small farmer? How many farmers will be deterred from putting in schemes of this character because they cannot conveniently raise fresh money?<br><br>
In introducing the Bill the Minister admitted the need for far greater credit facilities, and described the Bill as an injection of working capital. That was the basis upon which he asked the House to approve it. In effect, he was saying that the injection of working capital would not come about without schemes of this kind. I associate myself with the remarks of the hon. Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan). There can be no doubt about the existence of a credit problem, and for far greater credit facilities being provided if full advantage of the Bill is to be taken by farmers.<br><br>
After this scheme has operated for twelve months it may be that the Minister will find that farmers are not coming forward because the additional capital required to make their schemes worth while cannot be obtained. He will then find himself wishing to introduce a scheme for providing loans, and will have to go through the whole process of introducing fresh legislation, whereas, by accepting the Amendment, he would place himself in a position to have second thoughts and to put through another scheme providing for loans, either in addition or as an alternative to the present scheme.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Colonel Richard H. Glyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, on principle, that some small farmers might find themselves anxious to supplement by loans the grants provided under the scheme, but I am not convinced that it follows that the Government should take steps to make loans available, because they are already available in some cases. One difficulty is that the present facilities for obtaining loans are not always sufficiently widely understood. Something could be done to make them more widely understood.<br><br>
Not all farmers want loans—certainly at normal rates. At a recent meeting of a farmers' club this point was clearly made by a bank manager, who told the club that he had a scheme for advancing loans to small farmers but that only two people had used the facilities made available. The scheme had foundered because small farmers were not interested in borrowing. That was in an area in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and gallant Member explain what the scheme was?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel Glyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite impossible for me to explain the character of the scheme put forward, because the bank manager did not give details. He said that he had made the offer, and that the facilities were not used. If the hon. Member obtains a report of that meeting, which is available, he will be able to find out exactly what the bank manager said, which is what I have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many schemes of that sort are operated on a district basis by local officers, and they all founder because they are based upon the normal rates of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel Glyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but I wanted to make my point to those hon. Members who are not as familiar with the situation as is the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts)<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) referred to the Scandinavian plan, and the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) questioned where the farmers' banks obtained their capital. The answer is that they obtain it from other farmers. It is not always understood that in this country banks owe much more to farmers than farmers owe to banks. In an interesting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
article, the chairman of one of the joint stock banks stated that in his bank the deposits of farmers greatly exceeded the overdrafts. I consider that interesting.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
There may be possibilities of running some scheme in the nature of a farmers' bank on the lines of the scheme operating in Scandinavia. It is an interesting speculation. Other bankers have been studying plans to accommodate small farmers who want a loan at either no interest or very low interest rates and a scheme has been put forward by which it would be possible for a small farmer to borrow perhaps £2,000, from his bank manager if he had a grant of £1,000. That amount would have to be repaid in, say, ten years time. After applying to the scheme £1,000 of the money received either from the Minister or from the bank which is what he is bound to spend on it, the farmer would have a further £1,000 of borrowed money to use as he liked. The farmer would have to pay 5 per cent. interest on the borrowed money, that is, 1 per cent. above the present Bank Rate, or £100 a year for 10 years, which would amount to precisely the £1,000 received from the Minister. He would then have had an interest-free loan of £2,000.<br><br>
The only point is that at the end of 10 years the farmer would have to pay back the loan, and that is why small farmers do not like loans. They realise that a loan, whether or not it is interest-free, has to be repaid. That is their basic objection to a loan. Small farmers feel that they are mortgaging their farms. In a technical sense that may not be so, but that is the effect, and farmers do not wish to saddle themselves with the necessity of having to pay back borrowed money. It boils down, therefore, to the fact that what these farmers really want is a grant and not a loan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise one small but important point regarding the question of loans. The expression " creditworthy " has been used frequently in this Committee and it was used during the Second Reading debate. It also appears in the White Paper. We start, therefore, with the Minister admitting that the prospective recipients of these grants include a number of small farmers who are not creditworthy. A scheme may be produced under this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0728">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
Clause of the Bill in an endeavour to help farmers, who will not accept loans for the reasons explained by the hon. and gallant Member for Dorset, North (Colonel R. H. Glyn) to make then-farms more efficient.<br><br>
Apparently the process is simple. A farmer must intimate to the National Agricultural Advisory Service that he would like a business scheme. If his business prospers and his application is approved, automatically he qualifies for a grant. But what is the grant to be used for? Not, as was said by the hon. Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan), for some building or buildings which would complicate the position of the landlord and tenant, or the owner-occupier, and all the rest of it—which is utterly irrelevant to the provisions of this Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even for the farmer with 100 acres the maximum business grant over a period of three years is £360, to be made in four payments. But let us go to the other end of the scale and start with the minimum of 20 acres. The maximum grant that a man with 20 acres may obtain, as was said by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary during the Second Reading debate, is four payments—on approval, all fixed, settled, sealed and signed—of £30, to be used either for the purchase of livestock or equipment.<br><br>
What can a small farmer buy for £30? If the Ministry were super-generous and gave the maximum amount of £360 in one payment to a man farming 20 acres, what sort of buildings could he obtain for that sum? But, in fact, a man with 20 acres can receive only £6 an acre, that is, £120, in four payments extending over three years; or £30 today, £30 six months later, another £30 in 12 months, and then another £30 at the end of the period. Assuming that it is decided that only a purchase of livestock will help the farmer to become viable, what sort of livestock would it be possible for him to purchase with a first instalment of £30? I am referring to the man with 20 acres; in the case of the man with 30 acres the sum would be £180 and so on up the scale, with a maximum of £360.<br><br>
It is obvious that unless some means are provided to supplement that £30, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
activities of the small farmer will be held up until he receives a second payment, making a total of £60. But he will not be able to purchase many heifers, bullocks, sheep or sows for £30 or £60. After another 12 months, and after a total period of 18 months, the farmer may receive another £30, bringing his total receipts to £90. What sort of livestock will he be able to buy with that money in order to make his farm viable in the early days of the scheme?<br><br>
It seems to me, therefore, that the Minister must move away from what was said by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary during the Second Reading when I asked how the payments would be made. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary said that there would be an initial grant of £30 to the man with 20 acres; that six months later he would receive another £30; 12 months later he would receive another £30, and the final £30 at the end of the period.<br><br>
The Minister must find a way to help these farmers who will not borrow if they can help it. They will not borrow for two reasons. First, they do not feel able in the early months of the scheme to afford a loan. Secondly, they are uncertain about what will be the policy of this Government two or three years ahead. These farmers remember what they have suffered over the last three or four years and the way in which their position has deteriorated because the prices of the commodities they can produce on a small acreage have gone down and down.<br><br>
I suggest that the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) would allowed the Government, had they the will and desire to do so, to allow a scheme to be approved and to guarantee a grant over the period of three years and to make payments on the lines indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary. In addition, were livestock involved, particularly heavy livestock, apart from a £30 grant to the smallest of these small farmers, or the slightly higher amounts to those with more acres, the Government could advance the extra cost of the livestock in excess of the £30 grant.<br><br>
If the purchase of livestock is the one means of helping a small farmer back to viability, the sooner that livestock is on the farm the better. But we cannot expect that livestock and equipment can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0729">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
be purchased with an initial £30 and the expectation of another £30 six months later. It will be possible to purchase only one or the other, and not much of either. A scheme has to go through two or three Gethsemanes before approval is obtained. But once it is approved, it would appear reasonable that the Minister should have the power to increase the efficiency of a farm and the amount of livestock or equipment necessary to help the small farmer to reach his New Jerusalem.<br><br>
The Minister said something about bank managers or other sources from which farmers may borrow. As a rule, lenders of money are not charitable institutions, and anybody in grave doubt about the future will not be willing to accept too much money from non-charitable money lenders. The Government should set out to help the small farmers—not to frighten them to death, but to help them—and if they can help them by means of grants, so much the better. I do not ask that the amount of the grants be increased, but that the farmers should be helped in two ways. A start should be made on a three- to five-year scheme to help farmers to provide the right quantity of livestock and make the best use of their acreage. Or, alternatively, to provide machinery or equipment costing about the same amount of money. If in addition, a loan were advanced so that the whole of the necessary machinery or livestock could be obtained at once, then, as I said during the Second Reading debate, I think that the scheme has possibilities.<br><br>
The requisite expenditure is determined by the National Agricultural Advisory Service officer and not by the farmer himself. The farmer must satisfy the officer or the scheme is not approved. There is no fear that the farmer would let the Government down or fail the Minister providing the grant and a loan, because, in Clause 5 of the Bill, the Minister has power over a small farmer who is not doing his job properly. Not only can the Minister revoke a scheme, but he can reclaim any grants already received by the farmer. For these reasons I think that a case may be made out for extending the power of the Minister to make loans, and that the idea of loans from banks or agricultural mortgage corporations should be forgotten. The Minister should find a way
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
to carry out the scheme, and I am sure that ultimately the Government will be pleased if this Amendment is accepted now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. J. B. Godber)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient if I now try to sum up the points which have been made. We have had a fair discussion upon what I recognise is an important issue and one to which the Committee would desire to give careful thought.<br><br>
I realise that in discussing an Amendment of this kind hon. Members may be tempted to try to embrace the whole field of agricultural credit. That is a subject of great importance, but I ask the Committee to realise that this Amendment does not cover the whole field of agricultural credit—very far from it. The right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) made a fair point by relating his arguments specifically to the grants made under the provisions of this Bill; but one or two hon. Members opposite considered it in a much wider context, and I ask hon. Members not to follow those wider suggestions too far. Anything regarding this Bill must be related strictly to schemes provided under it and those are specifically restricted to small farmers.<br><br>
Considering that position we find that there is a difference of opinion—I will not exaggerate it—between some hon. Members opposite about whether loans should be interest-free, or made at a reasonable rate of interest—one hon. Member mentioned the market rate—or whether they should be subsidised in some way. There is a difference of opinion there. As I understand it, the general consensus of opinion of hon. Members opposite is that there should be loans, in some form or another, but the important distinction is that they want not just loans but loans in addition to grants.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I must remind them that their point of view is not that of the National Farmers' Union. The N.F.U. wanted loans in place of grants, and that distinction must be drawn. Hon. Members opposite seek loans plus grants. They wish to extend the frontiers of what the Government are trying to do. It is natural
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0730">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
enough, when the Government are seeking help, for the Opposition to try to push them still further. I quite understand their philanthropy in this matter, and their desire to help.<br><br>
It is right that they should put forward these views but, when we first considered this, we did, of course, consider loans. That was obviously a most attractive way for a Government to make such provisions. We gave it most careful thought, and went into it very thoroughly before we came down firmly, as my right hon. Friend has pointed out so clearly, in favour of grants, on the ground that we were seeking to help the small farmers whom we have specified. We felt that a large number of those who might come within the ambit of what we are seeking to do were the very ones who, as my right hon. Friend said, would not readily seek loans.<br><br>
To draw men into a scheme that gives grants is only a small part of our purpose. We are trying to get the advisory services welcomed to farms where they have not been welcomed before. We believe that many of these men who, in so many cases, are very genuine types, are those who have been suspicious of change, and have not been anxious to take part in new agricultural developments. We are trying to get our advisory services on to those farms, and thought that we could best do it by grants rather than loans.<br><br>
That was our very strong conclusion, and that was why we came down firmly in favour of grants. I do not think that it would be right to give loans in addition to grants on the level that we are proposing. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Don Valley has, quite fairly, taken the case of the smallest acreage that will benefit, and has pointed out that the amount is not very great.<br><br>
Nevertheless, over a period of three to five years the average assistance for these small farmers will be fairly substantial. If we were to provide loans from Government sources then, presumably, the only benefit that that would have in the eyes of hon. Members opposite is that those loans should be at rates of interest lower than those normally charged on the market. The fact remains that we are providing still further help to this section of the community—and it should be remembered that there are those who say
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
that we should not be providing any additional help at all. We have to keep a balance, and we think that what we are providing is fair and right, and will improve the creditworthiness of the farmers.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman quoted the case of the small man with 20 acres, who will receive only £30 as a start. We want to see the productivity of those farms increased, but the right hon. Gentleman went on to say—and it rather puzzled me—that they would need increases in stock sooner rather than later.<br><br>
That is not my view. The grants are directed towards improving the productivity of the acres that the man has——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The grass.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the grass.<br><br>
We say that at the beginning of this scheme he will not wish to increase his stock, but that, after 12 months of working, he should be in a better position to do so. We do not believe that, initially, he will want to increase his headage of stock, particularly when, in many cases, the assistance will be directed to ploughing up the existing grass and reseeding it. We want to see that done before the man increases his stock. At the end of the day, we want to see that land capable of carrying a greater quantity of stock, but we do not think that the man will be in a position to take further headage of stock immediately on receiving his initial grant——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not speaking from practical experience? The ploughing up of the old pasture, the use of proper fertilisers, and the reseeding of the land with the right seed, will make it so fertile that unless the stock is there to eat the grass as it comes up, it will be wasted. Surely that is the practical experience of any farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be good enough to be patient, and to look later at what I have said. The man gets his first grant at once, and the second one six months later. He will then have had half of his business grant within six months. Grass may grow devilish fast in Norfolk, Mr. Diamond, but I do not think that the hon. Member would find that it had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0731">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
grown so quickly in that period of six months that it would be unreasonable to say that he would not need to increase his stock until he had received those two payments——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. J. Champion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understood the hon. Gentleman to say that the farmer would get his first instalment immediately on acceptance of his plan, the second instalment six months later, and the whole spread over three years. The <i>Farmers' Weekly</i>—which, apparently, took up something from the Ministry's leaflet describing the scheme—points out that there will be four equal instalments—subject to satisfactory progress—payable at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. That seems rather different from getting, as in the case quoted by my right hon. Friend, £60 within six months of the commencement of the scheme. As far as I can see, the farmer will get £30 within six months of commencing, and £60 at the end of 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am so sorry. In what was almost the heat of the moment, I misled the Committee, and I apologise. It was a pure oversight. I should have said the first payment at the end of six months, and the second at the end of 12 months. My point was that they would be paid within six months of each other. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion) for his usual perspicacity in catching me out. It would, of course, affect my answer to his hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye). It would be 12 months before there would be any substantial improvement. I am sorry if I misled the Committee. I certainly did not intend to.<br><br>
Let us go a step further. The small farmer, once having got his scheme approved, and in the knowledge that he was to receive these payments, could then go to the bank manager, if and when he needed the additional stock, and would be in a more creditworthy position to approach the bank manager. I am sorry if the right hon. Gentleman does not like that expression, but it is a convenient word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Joint Parliamentary Secretary has devoted himself exclusively to the larger livestock, the heifers, the bullocks and so on. It is not conceivable that in some cases, at the very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
commencement, the grass will be already there, but not the livestock, whilst, in other cases, it may not be the heaviest animals at all that the advisory service officer recommends? It could be pigs, or it could be poultry, or it could be some of each, which could be put on the land almost the day afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very fair point, but he will agree that most of the discussion fias referred to cattle. In fact, it was the right hon. Gentleman himself who first led me astray because, on Second Reading, he spoke of half a beast. He cannot have it both ways.<br><br>
Once a scheme has been accepted and initiated, it is possible for the farmer to get his loan through the normal banking channels. That is the better way, and also meets the point about the administration of the scheme. It is no good laughing that off, and saying that our officials could readily determine creditworthiness. They are not in a position to do that. As it is, this scheme will put quite an additional load on them, and it is not fair to put too much on them.<br><br>
I am reinforced in that by what the right hon. Gentleman said on Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"I know that the staff of the National Agricultural Advisory Service is good. I set it up. It has to be good. But it will have to be super to achieve the target set by the right hon. Gentleman …—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th November, 1958; Vol. 595, c. 55.]</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members opposite seek to add to that target but, for administrative reasons, I could not commend that course to the Committee. I believe that the injection of this capital, and the initiation of these schemes will increase the availability of loan sources to those farmers whom we all wish to help.<br><br>
I quite understand right hon. and hon. Members opposite wishing to extend our provisions, but, for the reasons I have given, I think that ours is the best way of tackling this job, and it would not be right for us, therefore, in this Bill, to take powers for the making of loans of that sort. I have tried to deal with all the matters that have been raised—I realise that this is a point of interest—and I should be grateful if the Committee were now willing to come to a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. M. Philips Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The crux of the difference between us is that the Government supporters believe that the granting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0732">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
of credit to small farmers must be left to the private banks, while we, on this side, believe that that should not be the only means of providing credit; that there should also be such Government support as to ensure that small farmers will not be subject to the fluctuations of the Bank Rate and the various ups and downs of the money market, and that there is a case to be made out for a body of farmers, who are very often struggling in very difficult circumstances, to be treated somewhat more leniently than they would be treated by the private banks.<br><br>
I do not mean that the local bank manager is not a very sensible person, who tries to understand his customers' point of view, but he, also, is ruled by regulations, and often cannot go as far as he would like. There is, therefore, a strong case for allowing grants under this Bill to extend, in suitable cases, to the provision of cheap money.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
My experience of farmers at the present time, and I spoke only yesterday to a group of farmers who were fully representative of Gloucestershire, is that opinion is divided. There is a very large body of opinion amongst them taking the view that grants may affect the funds which are provided for the price guaranteed in the Annual Price Review. Surely, that is admitted by the Government, because there is no new money coming in here. The grants which are to be given to small farmers will have to be taken into consideration in the Annual Price Review, and will have to come out of the general fund. I heard many farmers say yesterday that they are afraid of that, and many of them said that they would rather have loans.<br><br>
It is true to say, as the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said, that the National Farmers' Union is not entirely against grants and in favour of loans. I understand that it takes the view that some farmers wish to have only loans, while others would prefer grants and loans, such as is suggested in our Amendment now before the Committee. I think the fact is that we will find among small farmers many who would be able to take loans without grants, feeling themselves strong enough to do so, and who, thereby,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
would not be a drag on the general fund, which affects the Price Review at the end of the year. There are also those who are not in that strong position, and who would therefore prefer to have grants. All we are asking is that the door should be open to them, and that it should be possible for both the one and the other, so that the farmer concerned can get what is most suitable in his case.<br><br>
It was said earlier in the discussion, and indeed the Minister said it, that he would not like to have the job of recovering loans from farmers, because some of them would not be able to pay. If the door is left open, I do not think that those who are not so creditworthy would ask for loans. They would ask for grants. Therefore, the people who would ask for loans would be the people who would be able to meet them.<br><br>
In regard to the point made about the difficulty of administering this provision, I am quite satisfied in my own mind that the Agricultural Advisory Service will be perfectly well able to advise. I have myself used the Agricultural Advisory Service to give me advice on such matters as whether it would be economic to make certain capital improvements on a smallholding. I found that the advice was very sound, and that it assisted me in coming to a decision. I am sure that the Minister can get perfectly good advice when he seeks it, and therefore need not force farmers into the hands of their local bank managers. Certainly, the local bank manager will have his function in cases where a small farmer does not want or does not need public money in the form of grants or loans. What I am asking for in this Amendment, which is a sound one, is that the Minister should not close the door.<br><br>
I end by repeating what I said at the beginning. In a matter of this kind, smallholders are a very important social element in the countryside, but they are often struggling and in difficulties, or, at any rate, many of them are. There is a very strong case for giving them opportunities of assistance, either in the form of grants or interest-paying loans which are not subject to the fluctuations of the market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. F. H. Hayman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to come down to principles in the matter of grants and loans. We have had the Joint Parliamentary Secretary quite
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
rightly replying to points of detail whether grants for capital improvements should be made or not, but it seems to me that there has been a repugnance on the part of the Government side of the Committee to the granting of loans. Hon. Members opposite are not against grants of public money. Indeed, hundreds of millions of pounds are paid out annually in grants to the farming community. I am not objecting to that. I believe in it, but I cannot understand why there is any objection by the Government to the making of a loan.<br><br>
I wish to inquire whether such a grant will be in respect of a single holding, or whether it may be made to a person for each of several holdings. I understand that in another place an eminent peer said that he had quite a number of holdings in Scotland, and, at some point in the discussion, I hope the Minister will make it clear. It seems to me that, in such a case, if a person is entitled to grants for several businesses, he might want a loan for one and a grant for the other.<br><br>
On the point concerning the Advisory Service, surely the Minister and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary are making very heavy weather of this? This Service does very valuable work, and it is appreciated on both sides of the Committee and by the farmers themselves. The officers of this Service can now go into great detail in the matter of grants to individual farmers, and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary himself will recall that on Second Reading he told me that in the great majority of these cases the advisory officers would have full power, at least, the regional officers, and would not have to refer cases to the Minister. Surely, in a case like that, there would be a small group of experienced officers who could deal with the reports which come to them from the advisory officers concerning loans. This is a matter of administration, in which I can see no difficulty at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. E. B. Hill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking about the need for trained officers. Does he know that the only country operating Government loans of this nature is the United States of America, through the farmers' home administration, which has most elaborate and very expensive courses of training for the officers who have to administer the scheme? That I am quite sure could not be done here without training. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
spite of that set-up, these Government loans represent only 4 per cent. of the farmers' working capital, so that perhaps this is an administrative difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood my argument. I have said that the Advisory Service would deal with the examination of claims from applicants. That is happening at the moment, and we all accept it. All I am suggesting is that their reports should go to a small group of experienced people, who obviously would be trained in banking and that kind of thing. It would not be difficult at all. The hon. Member for Honiton (Mr. Mathew) frowns, but in all kinds of administration decisions are taken at a fairly high level by experienced people on reports submitted to them by subordinates trained for the job.<br><br>
I see no reason why there should not be grants or loans at very low rates of interest. Why not loans at 2½ per cent.? The Government borrow money from the nation in Post Office Savings accounts at 2½ per cent. Is there any reason why they should not lend money at 2½ per cent.? All we want is an Amendment to an enabling Bill. We want this Amendment as something to give greater freedom to whoever may be the Minister of Agriculture called upon to administer this scheme. The Minister, in his first intervention in this Committee, said that he has a tremendous faith in the small farmers. I ask the Government to give us tangible proof of that faith by accepting the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. L. Mallalieu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say now very disappointing I found the reply of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to this debate, which, after all, has ranged widely and has produced the most constructive suggestions. Yet he has turned down our proposition, and, for that course, has not advanced any substantial justification.<br><br>
May I stress again the fact that we are not urging him to commit himself to give loans. All we are asking is that, in the circumstances of this Bill, which, after all, he has produced here, if he wishes to complete his work, he should at least reserve to himself the power to use loans merely to achieve the object for which his Bill is supposed to be? He has given us excellent reasons why there should be grants, and, in general,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0734">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
we on this side of the Committee agree with him that there should be grants, but it is on the other side that I beg him to think again about this. At a later stage, perhaps, he could produce revised thoughts for this Committee, perhaps at an even later stage when this Committee has ceased to be active.<br><br>
Surely, his scheme will not succeed unless there is the possibility in some instances of making loans at a very low rate of interest. It is not of the slightest use, as has already been pointed out, to improve grassland if one has not the stock to take advantage of that improved grassland. It seems to me that what the Minister is doing, is making it only too likely that a small farmer who has received a grant will use that grant fairly soon after receiving it to increase the very branch of production which one does not need to increase, namely, pigs and poultry; and that he is not going to increase the very branch of production which we do need increased, namely, beef. Surely, if that is so, it vitiates the whole of the purposes of the Minister's Bill, because they are just not going to come to fruition. He should surely provide, or be able to provide, some parallel scheme which will enable production to be channelled into those channels most profitable to the nation as a whole. He is not doing it.<br><br>
The tone of the whole debate so far has been singularly free from party spirit, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will once again think that my speech is unhelpful if I introduce a note which, heaven knows, I do not want to introduce, but which it seems to me is forced upon me in the circumstances. Tremendous interest is shown by the hon. Gentleman and the party opposite in grants and none at all in doing that which would make those grants permanently profitable to the nation; namely, giving a little bit extra in loans at reasonable rates of interest which would make sure that those grants are capable of being turned to the interests of the nation as a whole.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
How can one avoid a suspicion in the back of one's mind—and I like to think that it comes to my mind far less quickly than to the minds of many others—that these grants have been brought forward as a carrot for the small farmer at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
election when it will not matter what happens afterwards? If the election takes place within twelve months this will help the results and will soon be forgotten. The party opposite will have had the results of the election, but we know that the result that we all profess to want, namely increased production on the lines that the nation needs, will not matter if by this or some similar means the party opposite will have been enabled to win.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt the hon. and learned Member, but I must point out, on the question of numbers and an election within twelve months, that our estimate for the number involved is 25,000, though the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) says that that estimate is too large. If the hon. and learned Member says that 25,000 people, one way or another, will decide the next election his case is certainly not the same as ours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, that number will not decide it, but if the party opposite presents a very pleasing carrot to 25,000 who belong to a community the rest of that community may very well be pleased, too.<br><br>
The only reply made to the arguments which have been so cogently put forward from this side of the Committee is that already small farmers, if they are creditworthy, can obtain credit. That is self-evident. They can obtain credit at a certain rate of interest It is not enough to say that small farmers for whom the Minister hopes to cater are not the sort of people who would wish to saddle themselves with loans. The Minister may be right that a great many small farmers would not wish to so saddle themselves, but what about those who do? Are their schemes not to be allowed to come to success because they cannot obtain these loans at a sufficiently attractive rate of interest? The hon. and gallant Member for Dorset, North (Colonel R. H. Glyn) pointed out that certain farmers would have available to them the credit that they would desire. That is very fair, but what about those who have not that credit available at a sufficiently attractive rate of interest? That is the whole point. Those are the people for whom we speak.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to consider this matter again, if he cannot do so this morning. I ask him to take this power, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
nobody asks him to use except in cases where he is absolutely satisfied that it would be for the good of the nation to use it. I submit that these arguments are very hard to resist and, in my respectful submission, have not been successfully resisted this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu) mentioned electoral advantage. Is my hon. and learned Friend aware that when polling took place in the by-election in the North of Scotland all those who went to the poll, irrespective of the candidate for whom they voted, in fact voted for this Amendment? Is he aware that when newspapers circulating in that area reported the speech made by the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie) on Second Reading they called attention to the fact that provision for a grant as small as this, unaccompanied by a loan was of no use whatsoever to the small farmers in the North of Scotland and the electors were advised that what they should do was to return a Member of Parliament as independent as the hon. Member for Banff who had supported that proposal and had criticised the Bill. Therefore, whoever the electors voted for, the Minister should be aware that they voted for the Amendment and against the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. S. Duthie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my Second Reading speech I never mentioned a loan. I was merely dealing with marginal assistance. That was the whole substance and burden of my remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member read a report of his speech, occupying half a page of a certain newspaper, he would find that three inches of one column were devoted to quoting what he said and the rest was devoted to describing how excellent it was to have an independent Conservative in Parliament who would criticise his party and the Government when the small farmers were being let down by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that he might be prejudicing the chances of the new Member for Aberdeenshire, East coming on this Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very possible.<br><br>
I should like the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland to say a few words
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
about this matter. The Minister made it abundantly clear on several occasions in the course of his reply that he could speak only for England and Wales. He repeated that after I had interrupted him. In the circumstances, I should like the Joint Under-Secretary to speak for Scotland. The Minister seemed to attach great importance to the fact that the Government were not the appropriate instrument to investigate the creditworthiness of farmers. I think that the hon. Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan) really wanted to see an instrument like Scottish Agricultural Securities given power to lend money for the purpose of stocking the farm and not just for building, but the Minister seemed to think that the hon. Member was concerned only with loans from the Agricultural Mortgages Corporation and Scottish Agricultural Securities for the purposes of building. If I did not hear the hon. Member for South Angus aright let him correct me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) said that I was irrelevant in speaking about buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member was irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not irrelevant, and I was talking about buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is taking very great care not to answer my question. I have no doubt at all that he expects the farmers of Angus to think that he was speaking about finance for stocking, because he turned from owner-occupiers and owners of farms to the plight of the tenants.<br><br>
We argue in moving the Amendment only that it should be possible under the Bill to make loans available as well as grants for the purpose of giving effect to these programmes. Everybody knows that there will be a great many small farmers, though we do not know how many, who will not be able to go on with their programmes to improve their businesses unless they receive some credit as well as the grants. Therefore, the Minister, in refusing the Amendment, may very well be denying to many small farmers the advantage to which he attaches very great importance. We do not suggest that officers of the Ministry
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
or of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland should investigate the creditworthiness of a farmer, though we have no doubt that a great deal of that must be done to decide whether or not a grant will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are perfectly willing that the powers of other organisations, like the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and Scottish Agricultural Securities should be extended so that they might make loans available and they might examine the creditworthiness of the small farmers. Will the Minister suggest that they are inappropriate to investigate the creditworthiness of small farmers? They are accepted by the Government as being the right instruments to investigate the creditworthiness of the biggest farmers in the land, and since credit is given to the richest and most powerful, surely it would not be wrong to make Government-supported credit available to the small farmers in the community.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Scotland has responsibility not only for the agricultural industry but also for the fishing industry. The farmers who will be taking advantage of these grants under this Clause are largely farmers who hitherto have obtained the benefits of marginal agricultural production grants. Let us take the analogy of the fishing industry. The smaller sections of that industry, the inshore fishermen, are the people who have been in the least efficient part of the industry. They have had grants or support for some time, in the way of assistance for their landings of fish, but we have all seen the advantage of improving the efficiency of their business by enabling them also to get new boats. We never thought for a moment that they could get new boats if we merely made grants available. We made grants and loans available, and the Herring Industry Board and the White Fish Authority have to examine the creditworthiness of applicants. They have to make grants and loans, knowing that there is no point in having the one without the other. It would be possible to have a loan without a grant provided that the loan were big enough, but if a grant is made it must be accompanied by a loan.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
As the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland knows full well, smallholdings in Scotland are in the main administered by his Department and not by the county councils, as in England and Wales. A new smallholder is not expected to find all the finance needed to stock his holding when he starts farming. He is enabled to stock the holding and put his business on an efficient basis with the assistance of a generous loan given by the Government, after investigation of his creditworthiness by officers of the Agricultural Department for Scotland. Why is it reasonable and logical to give loans to all these people, loans which are the accompaniment of grants in most cases, and it is inappropriate to give a loan to accompany a grant in this case?<br><br>
Unlike the Minister of Agriculture, who says that he speaks only for England and Wales, I speak in this context only for Scotland. I cannot claim to know the minds of those who are south of the Border, but I have no doubt whatsoever that I speak for farmers in Scotland when I say that what they want more than anything else is that credit for the carrying out of these programmes should be made available through some Government instrument, because they find that they cannot obtain it through the normal agencies. I beg the Joint Under-Secretary to say whether or not what I have said about Scotland is factually true or not. If he cannot say that it is untrue, he will find it difficult to support the Minister against the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will feel that I ought to answer the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser), in spite of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord cannot do it in a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that I can, but it does not matter. I may spill over a minute or two of the Committee's time but that cannot be helped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will take an hour at least.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must pay tribute to the hon. Member for Hamilton. It is to his credit that he raised the subject of the by-election at Aberdeenshire, East at all. Having said that I propose to leave that matter there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Tories had a minority vote.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton and the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr.<i></i> Emrys Hughes) raised the theory that there would be some sort of investigation into the creditworthiness of the farmer in respect of this scheme. I cannot emphasise too strongly again that that is simply not so. The only investigation that there will be, and of course there will be to that extent, will be into the soundness of the farmer's improvement proposals. But there will definitely not be an investigation into his creditworthiness. That is an absolute fact.<br><br>
As to the comparison with the grant and loan schemes for the fishing industry,</span></p>
