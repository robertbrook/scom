<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>9th December</i>], In page 4, line 47, to leave out from " a " to " and " in line 48 and to insert " County Agricultural Executive Committee "—[<i>Mr. Peart</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed</i>, That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause.</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. J. B. Godber)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the moment when we rose at our last sitting none of us, I think, was aware of the tragic road accident in which an hon. Member of this Committee, Mr. Sidney Dye, had lost his life that morning. Therefore, at this, the very earliest possible moment, with your permission, Mr. Diamond, I should like to express on behalf of hon. Members on all sides of the Committee our deepest sorrow and regret at this very tragic occurence.<br><br>
This is not an occasion for a recognition of Mr. Dye's many qualities, but I am quite sure that all of us feel very deeply the sense of loss we sustained in the loss of an hon. Member who was a great supporter of agriculture. I wish to pay this very brief tribute to him and to say how deeply we all regret what has happened. My right hon. Friend the Minister, in particular, wishes to be associated with my remarks. He would have been here to make them himself but for an indisposition. He has already sent a telegram to Mr. Dye's widow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. J. Champion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the unavoidable absence of my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams), may I say that we are all grateful to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary for his reference to our late
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
colleague? We all deplore his passing and remember with gratitude his speeches in Parliament on agriculture. Perhaps the most fresh in our memory is his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill, when he had the great honour of winding up for the Opposition. We members of the Labour Party, of course, deplore this loss very much. It is certainly a loss to the Parliamentary Labour Party. It is also a loss to Parliament itself—[HON. MEMBERS: " Hear, hear."]—and certainly a loss to the great industry of which he was ever, in this House and elsewhere, a worthy champion. We join with the Joint Parliamentary Se cretary and all those who knew Mr. Dye in mourning with his wife, his family and everyone who knew him intimately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roderic Bowen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to associate myself and my colleagues with the sentiments which have been expressed. We all mourn the loss of a very great friend of agriculture and the practical approach he always applied to all our problems. I associate myself completely with what has been said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. E. B. Hill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a County of Norfolk Member, may I also express the regret of my colleagues to the family in this tragic loss? The loss is a great one to the House and also a much greater one to the County of Norfolk, in which Sidney Dye assumed so many voluntary public activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frederick Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a question to ask the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, but before I ask it I should like to join in paying tribute to Sidney Dye. He was a great character and represented the true voice of the countryside. To those of us who knew him well he was a charming friend. It is difficult to believe that we shall not hear his voice again in this Committee.<br><br>
Before we leave this Amendment, I wish to ask the Joint Parliamentary Secretary whether he has had time to look at the point raised at our last sitting. While we appreciate the assurance given, he will realise that it is without any reflection on his right hon. Friend that we should prefer the assurance to appear in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman said he would look at the point to see if we could make a precedent for a statutory provision applying to England and Wales.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0842">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. F. H. Hayman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Joint Parliamentary Secretary replies, may I say a word about our late colleague? His reputation was not confined only to Parliament, for he was well known outside Westminster and Norfolk. Only this morning I had a letter from the Secretary of the Cornwall Branch of the National Farmers' Union asking if I could let him know the address of Mrs. Dye, so that he could write expressing appreciation of Mr. Dye's services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given careful consideration to the point raised by the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) and to the expression of opinion we had at the end of our last sitting. Naturally I wish to do anything I can to assist hon. Members in this matter, but I see very real difficulty in going further than I have already gone. I think I have gone quite a long way in giving a firm administrative undertaking that this course will be followed. We are following precedents set in regard to other matters. The Farm Improvement Scheme is similar. If we were to single out the Small Farmer Scheme for statutory recognition in this way it might cause invidious comparison.<br><br>
I did not develop the argument fully at our last sitting as I was watching the clock, but the other aspect of the problem is that if we did as is suggested it might cause invidious comparison with other enactments. Having given this definite administrative undertaking, which falls closely in line with what we are doing with other schemes, I do not think anyone need have fear of what we are doing in this matter. I hope that, with that assurance, the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Peart) will not press the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frederick Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 49, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>" which report, if so requested, shall be made available to the person who appears to the Minister to be carrying on the business for the time being ".</p></blockquote>
This Amendment follows the recommendations of the Franks Committee. We hope, therefore, it will be acceptable to the Government. I must express the surprise which my hon. and learned
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
Friend the Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu) expressed on an earlier Amendment, that this has not been anticipated by the Government. It seems very odd that, time after time, the Opposition has the obligation to put forward the Franks Committee recommendations. I shall say no more about the Amendment at the moment except that if the Joint Parliamentary Secretary is not about to give way to us forthwith I shall call in aid the vigour and eloquence of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Brigg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. L. Mallalieu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite this much heralding of the eloquence of the hon. and learned Member for Brigg, I have very little to say on this Amendment except that I am sure the Government would wish to accept it, assuming that it is properly drafted. The whole point is that justice should appear to be done as well as that it should be done. I submit that the people with whom we are dealing in the Bill are, as a class, fundamentally intelligent, and that they respond to treatment as intelligent people. I submit that it is only intelligent to publish the reasons which have moved the Minister to do whatever he does according to the report given to him under Clause 5 (2, <i>b</i>).<br><br>
I have nothing to add except to say that I hope the Minister will see his way to fall in with the recommendations of the Franks Report and to see to it that the reasons on which the Minister has acted in withdrawing a grant shall at least be made plain, in writing, to the person most concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the Amendment, and I do so particularly as a member of the Franks Committee. I do not want to enlarge on the matter as the arguments in favour of the Amendment are only too obvious. The action proposed in Clause 5 is, of necessity, of a penal character. If the report is to be a form of punishment, then, in the interests of natural justice, the person concerned should be informed of the basis on which the decision has gone against him. If the Minister resists this he will leave a sense of injustice with the farmer and also leave an impression among the farming community as a whole that something is being done in a hole and corner fashion. There seems no earthly reason why the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0843">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
farmer should not be told precisely what are the findings of the person who has conducted the inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with sympathy to the points which have been put forward from hon. Members on this Amendment. I think we can say that we accept the principle embodied in the Amendment, even without the full flights of oratory which the hon. and learned Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu) could no doubt call on if necessary, but on this occasion I assure him that is not necessary. This is a perfectly sound and valid point and in line with what the Government are seeking to do in relation to the Report of the Franks Committee, of which the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) was a distinguished member. Therefore, I accept the principle, but I cannot accept the words in the Amendment. I will undertake to bring forward at a later stage words to embody this principle, and I hope that will be satisfactory to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the reply of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary implied no criticism of the draftsmanship of those on this side of the Committee. Noting what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise at this point to respond to an invitation extended to me at the last sitting regarding the leaflets to which a number of hon. Members referred and which they said they would like to have made available. I have taken the opportunity of bringing some of the leaflets with me this morning to make sure that hon. Members may have copies, and, if I have your permission, Mr. Diamond, I wish physically to hand them over so that they may be available to hon. Members,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godman Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend be good enough to explain why we have to include in the Clause the mention of
<br><blockquote><p>" a person appointed … by that Minister."</p></blockquote>
In the presence of a member of the Franks Committee, I hesitate to raise the point, but I raised it on Second Reading
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary did not take the opportunity of explaining it to me. I was under the impression that we were trying to make it dear that anyone who had a dispute with the Minister would have his dispute considered by someone not appointed by the Minister. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary has said that he will be considering some words with a view to tabling an Amendment to overcome this difficulty. It would be of help if he would explain why he thinks the matter should go forward in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before dealing with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Rye (Mr. Godman Irvine), may I deal with an intervention which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan) with regard to the Scottish leaflets? I am sorry that they are not yet available, but I hope they will be available before very long.<br><br>
In reply to my bon. Friend the Member for Rye, I am sorry if I was not able to deal with that point on Second Reading, but in debates on this Clause I have established that the person appointed by the Minister shall be from the C.A.E.C., or from members of it.<br><br>
As to whether it should be a person appointed by the Minister or by some outside body, I tried to deal with that matter at an earlier stage. In fact, strictly speaking, this is not really a Franks issue. This is money for which the Minister is responsible for spending; he is responsible to Parliament for its proper expenditure. If he finds that it is not being properly expended, it is his duty to provide, under his own control, for methods of protection to see that that money can, if necessary, be reclaimed, or at least that no more shall be spent. It is not strictly speaking the same class of case as that dealt with by the Franks Committee. It is right that the Minister should retain this power under his own jurisdiction and for his own—I will not say officials—representatives. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will realise the distinction. It is only because of the need to safeguard the expenditure of public money in this way that it is done in this form.</span></p>

—(INTERPRETATION.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to a matter that we have previously discussed. I am glad to see that we have the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) with us, because he was interested in the same point. It is the definition of " small farm business." We discussed the matter at some length, and we referred in anticipation to the definition given in this Clause. It sems to me that we are entitled to a further statement from the Government about this definition. I fully appreciate the difficulties arising from the discussion we have already had on this definition, and I think it would be unrealistic to assume that both sides of the Committee are agreed about what the definition would be. But the Minister endeavoured to go so far to meet us that I want, if I may, to define the extent to which he has gone, because I do not think it would satisfy us on this side of the Committee nor possibly the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
I gathered that the right hon. Gentleman was saying that the Bill will provide a formula for voluntary amalgamation. In so far as that is concerned, it is desirable. This provides a formula for voluntary amalgamation. He went further when he discussed businesses, and said that if two or three small farmers joined in a partnership they would come within the scheme. That, again, is not undesirable. But we are concerned with a wider definition than that. We were anxious to bring within the scope of the Bill people who. in one form or another, genuinely cooperated, although such co-operation—I used the phrase " joint enterprise "—was short of either amalgamation or partnership.<br><br>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to assure us that he is willing between now and Report stage to look further at this definition to see whether it is possible to extend it to include a defined category. I know the difficulty, which is that one cannot allow absolute distinction. I would ask the hon. Gentleman to see whether it is possible to provide for a defined category of people, wider than " small farmers," who amalgamate their holdings or who join together in a partnership. I should have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
thought that it seems to be accepted by the whole Committee that if we could encourage small farmers to work more closely together we might provide a way of farming which would be more efficient and which would, at the same time, provide for the individuality of the small farmers themselves, and that the Government ought to look at any such proposal as favourably as they can.<br><br>
We are not complaining that no Amendment has appeared at this stage because we fully appreciate that it is a difficult matter. If the Government do not undertake the responsibility, we may try before the Report stage to do something ourselves. But I would concede at once, having looked at the definition, that it is a difficult matter. The Government have greater resources than we have, and greater ingenuity and more skilled advice. But I hope they will at any rate be able to give us an assurance that, between now and the Report stage, they will look anxiously at this problem and see whether it is possible to widen the definition of farm businesses to include farmers who give a patent overt pledge of working together and to give them the support that they would not otherwise obtain under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to supplement the observation of the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) in one or two respects. It seems to me that there are two parts here. The Minister has informed us—and I do not in any way quarrel with his interpretation—that if two small farmers, neither of whom could qualify individually under the scheme, in fact came together and formed a legal partnership and then put in a scheme sponsored by the partnership, that might be eligible under the present Bill as drafted. I should have thought that that is something which is clearly desirable. If the Minister does regard that as something desirable, I think the present wording of the Bill should be altered in order to make it quite clear to those who will be concerned with this Bill that that type of operation is covered.<br><br>
It is quite clear at present that someone who had not either legal knowledge or the resources of legal interpretation which the Minister has, might well be misled on this point because the Minister has to rely entirely upon the interpretation of the phrase, " any person." I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0845">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
am quite sure that the ordinary small farmer and, indeed, organisations certainly on a local level, would not envisage that that wording could cover two small farmers, or three for that matter, coming together, joining in a partnership and submitting a scheme on behalf of the partnership as a whole. I would ask the Minister to consider whether he could not put down an Amendment at the appropriate stage to make that position abundantly clear.<br><br>
The position is accentuated by the fact that the pamphlet with which the Minister has just supplied us does not refer to the matter. I should have thought that if it is desired that farmers could voluntarily avail themselves of this scheme it would be a good thing if there was some reference to this aspect of the matter in the literature given out by the Ministry in this regard. This pamphlet has just come into my possession, but, as far as I can see, the expression all through is, " small farmer ". There is nothing at all to suggest that two or three small farmers could form a partnership which would stand an equal chance of approval as a scheme put in by one small farmer who happens to come within the limits of the Bill. I would prefer that both in the Bill and in the literature given out by the Minister it should be made quite clear this type of circumstances would be covered by the Bill.<br><br>
The other point is this. So far I have been referring only to where, for legal purposes, two or more small farmers become one. They form a legal partnership, are operated as one and have to be treated as one in law. I think it is quite clear that that circumstance is covered by the Bill. But what we have to consider is whether we are going to limit the position solely to those who come together and form for the purposes of their farm business as a whole a strict legal partnership, or whether the benefits of this scheme should be extended to persons who are still working in co-operation, but who are not a legal partnership in respect of the whole of that farm businesses activities.<br><br>
I appreciate that this is a difficult matter, but I should have thought that it was not beyond the ingenuity of the Minister to produce something which would cover those persons who want to take advantage of the scheme, who do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
not want to amalgamate their farming activities completely, but who are prepared to amalgamate that part of their activities which would be covered by the scheme. As I say, I appreciate that there would have to be safeguards and rigid conditions laid down if the operation of the scheme was to be widened in this way.<br><br>
I invite the Minister to look again at the matter and to consider whether, if he is really interested in these small farmers getting together and helping themselves through the medium of the scheme, it would be possible to widen the Bill to cover such persons even though they are not a strict partnership in respect of their farming activities as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a layman I rise to support the plea of my hon. Friend and of the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen). I do so all the more because it is perfectly obvious from what they have said that, even if the Minister's interpretation a week or two ago about the small farmer is to have any real meaning, as I have pointed out from time to time, and as others of my hon. Friends have pointed out, a huge proportion of all the agricultural holdings in the country are farmed by small part-time farmers who are expressly excluded, as such, from the scope of the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister said that " person" includes "persons", and I am therefore glad to see that the phrase "small farmers " is substituted in the leaflet for the word " person " which appears in the Bill. As far as I know, the people who farm these smallholdings in my part of the world are going to hesitate before they go to a lawyer to have some legal partnership drawn up. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will try to see whether he can put something into the Interpretation Clause which will make it more clear to the ordinary person that these small people can join together for the purposes of this scheme and get its benefits, without having to go to all sorts of legal transactions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) spoke of the Government having more resources, more skilled advice and more ingenuity. They have, I expect, more skilled advice and more resources, but I doubt whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0846">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
they have more ingenuity. But if the matter is put to the test, I have no doubt that the Minister will do a good job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not go into the question now of who has the most ingenuity in this Committee. There seems a difference of opinion on the other side in this matter. I want to take up straight away one point made by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Hayman) when he said that the part-time farmer was excluded as such. That is not so. I think it is important to get this clear. The farm business has got to be equivalent to a full-time business. If a man who works part-time and gets his wife to help, or perhaps by working very hard himself amasses the correct number of man-days then he will come within the scheme. So the part-timer is not automatically excluded, and I think it is important that we should always remember that. I think that the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Philips Price) raised on an earlier Amendment the point of where a part-time man was in fact doing over 250 days, and thus came within the scheme. It is important that that should be clear.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
This argument on co-operation and amalgamation is, I realise, a very important one, and it is one which we have debated at earlier stages of this Committee. My right hon. Friend went at some length into the reasons why we felt it necessary to limit it to amalgamations, and not extend it to looser forms of cooperation which had no legal validity. I can, however, sympathise with those who see the advantages in co-operation, and who have urged us to include it in the Bill, but, frankly, that is not the purpose of the Bill.<br><br>
The purpose of the Bill is to help small farmers, and, if we are to have co-operation or amalgamation among full-time small farmers, we must realise the extent to which this Bill will be able to help. Actually, amalgamations among full-time small farmers will be severely limited at present by the operation of the upper limits of the scheme. While the possibility is there, we must not over-stress it and mislead the farming community in regard to it. Amalgamation is not excluded, but it will be definitely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
limited by the upper limit of man-days that we propose. The same thing would apply if we were to think in terms of co-operation, and I should have thought that the amount of co-operation capable of being eligible would not have been very great in regard to full-time small farmers.<br><br>
In regard to part-time farmers, the scope is greater, but I think that if we are to put public money into these holdings we must be sure of a continuity of operation over a period of years. I do not think it would be right for us to rely on a looser form of amalgamation which had no legal validity. Indeed, I think it would be very dangerous. We have to draw the line somewhere, and we have to be clear in relation to this. I have the greatest sympathy with the objects of cooperation in agriculture, and there is opportunity for co-operation in relation to those who individually qualify under the Small Farmer Scheme by using their farm business grants for the co-operative ownership of implements and that sort of thing. That is by no means excluded, but to have a co-operative scheme over the whole field, I think, quite frankly, would be wrong. I do not see just how we could justify it in regard to the expenditure of this public money. It is for those reasons, although I have listened with sympathy for the object, that I do not see how I could accept the suggestion or undertake to enlarge the sphere which we have provided.<br><br>
As to the question which the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) raised about the actual interpretation, he suggested that we should put some words into the Bill to make it clear. I think he will agree with me that, legally, the words we have put in cover the point—that the word " person " covers " persons ". There is no dispute in law about that, and I am sure he will agree. Therefore, I think it is wrong to put further words in the Bill which would be merely explanatory in that regard. I will certainly agree to look at it, but I should not have thought that there was any justification for it.<br><br>
On the other point which the hon. and learned Gentleman made that we should advertise and publicise the possibility of joint action under the scheme, I am entirely in agreement with him. As regards the particular leaflet which he mentioned, I would say that it was in print before we had these discussions in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0847">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
this Committee. I assure him that my right hon. Friend has taken very careful note of this point, and that we will do our best to publicise this particular aspect. On the other hand, when we are spending a large amount of money, we do not want to raise a lot of hopes. We have to put it in proper perspective, and, while we will try in our publicity to put it over in the most effective way, I do not think it would be necessary or wise to include the words in the Bill. But I will certainly inquire into it and see if I can give some undertaking between now and Report stage.<br><br>
The position is that I stand on what my right hon. Friend said previously, that all legal partnerships, whether by part-time or full-time farmers, which come within these terms as laid down in the White Paper, will qualify, but with regard to those farmers who do not qualify, we could not allow them to come within the terms of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the noble Lord the Joint Under-Secretary of State clarify one point for me? I understand that the law on amalgamations is different in Scotland. Can he explain exactly how this will work in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lbrd John Hope)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not without notice, but I will look it up, and let the hon. Gentleman have an answer to the question he has put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whatever ingenuity I possess, I recognise that we are now discussing the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, and we have not put down an Amendment to this provision. While I recognise the difficulties of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, I do not think he has given us a very encouraging reply.<br><br>
The purpose of the Bill is to help small farmers, and I think he ought to be more anxious than he appears to be to try to seek a solution of this problem. I think we have to recognise that when we are dealing with small farmers, we are dealing with people who have a very rugged individuality. It may be very difficult to persuade such people to make amalgamations or indeed enter into partnerships. but it might be possible—I urge the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to look at this seriously—to get other forms of cooperation which would meet the purpose: of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
As I understand the Bill, its purpose is to encourage a different pattern of husbandry which will be more efficient, and there is a limited time within Which that pattern will be introduced. There are powers of revocation and I should have thought that, with the power of revocation and with the recognition of the purpose of the Bill, the Joint Parliamentary Secretary would be prepared, at any rate, to look at this matter again, to see whether it would not be possible to obtain the guarantees he needs—and we do not quarrel about that—to provide for a form of words which would be less than a partnership or an amalgamation. I recognise that we are now debating the Clause as a whole and that I cannot pursue the matter further at the present time.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(EXPENSES.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>. That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point on Clause 7, because this deals with expenses. As the Committee knows, I am for ever the watch dog of the public purse. If we turn to the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, we find that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The administration costs are estimated at about £750,000 for the first year; of this about £450,000 represents the cost of existing staff, particularly advisory officers, who will be engaged on work under the schemes."</p></blockquote>
We accept that. This is a redeployment of the staff which the Ministry has, but as there is a provision for the expenditure of a further £300,000, perhaps the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will explain what that consists of.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to expand this explanation that appears in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. As the hon. Member said, a large part of the figure of £750,000 is provided for the advisory services, but I think I indicated at an earlier stage—I think, in winding up on Second Reading—the way in which this would operate, and from that it would be clear, I think, that this is going to put a considerable extra burden on the executive staff. The divisional executive officer would be the channel through Whom these things were considered. In many cases, they will not go further. This will impose a substantial additional burden on our divisional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0848">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
executive officers and that should not be lost sight of.<br><br>
That will account for a considerable part of this cost allowed for, in that we are utilising the staff in this way, and they will be responsible not only for the channelling of schemes through to the N.A.A.S. and back, but afterwards for the inspection—I avoid the word used by the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams), which was " policing "—the inspection after agreements have been made in order to see that the scheme is carried out on a proper basis before public money is spent. It is a necessary provision, and I am sure he would realise that there should be reasonable inspection before these sums are spent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask some questions on a point which interests me, and the particular topic in which I am interested is one for which the representative of the Scottish Department is responsible. When the Minister who represents the English Department says that this will cast a considerable burden on the executive staff, I would point out that he is not the Minister responsible for the executive side in Scotland. The noble Lord is responsible for the Agricultural Department in Scotland. Therefore, when the Minister for England say that there will be a considerable burden on the executive side for England, I should like to know what is likely to be the corresponding burden on the executive side in Scotland. Is it considerable? What does it involve? Does it involve a large increase in the number of the staff?<br><br>
I can foresee that there will be a large number of applications from Scotland. I presume that there will be, because anything that means money to small farmers will naturally cause a certain amount of curiosity among the farming community in Scotland. Could the Minister tell us to what extent there is likely to be increased expenditure in his Department.<br><br>
I ask this because the accounts are separate from those of England. The Minister talks of a substantial additional burden so far as England is concerned, but how substantial is this burden likely to be in Scotland? Has the Minister any facts or figures which he can give? I presume he has, because this is essentially a Clause which refers to payments and to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
<br><blockquote><p>" any other expenses of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Secretary of State incurred in pursuance of this Act."</p></blockquote>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Does this reference to the " Secretary of State " mean the Secretary of State for Scotland? If so, why has Scotland been omitted in the definition? We are entitled to a much more exact definition here, and if the words "of Scotland" have been deliberately omitted it is an extraordinary commentary on Scotland's present position. Surely "Scotland" has not become an indecent word. Is this a mistake in drafting, or is it a Freudian error? Scotland seems now to be expected to allow herself to be treated almost as an appendix. We are very anxious to scrutinise wth great care the accounts of the Department. We do not wish in any way to be ungenerous. We want the staff necessary to make this scheme for helping small farmers a success. Could the noble Lord tell us what this additional burden means in personnel, and what it will cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We know that as a result of the merging of the Ministry of Food with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, many local and district offices have been closed. The consequence is that in many rural areas the Ministry's main office for the administration of this scheme will often be great distances from the farmers who are to be assisted. Some farmers in my constituency will be as much as 100 miles away from the office, with no public transport available to them. Can we be assured that farmers will be able to interview those concerned with the operation of this scheme; to see the people who can advise and help them, without their having to go from one office to another?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I got a little confused at the beginning of the essay of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes). I was just getting used to his line of approach, in terms of Freud, when he switched on to what seemed to be a treatise on the appendix. At that point, I confess that I was unable to follow him.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then got on to two perfectly good points. He first asked why the Secretary of State is not defined as being the Secretary of State for Scotland. The convention is that Secretaries of State are not expressly designated in a Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0849">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
unless more than one of them is involved in it. The hon. Member then asked about extra staff in Scotland. We do not expect to be called upon to provide any substantial extra staff. We think that we shall be able to handle the business with the staff at present available——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that all this assistance to the small farmers is to be carried out without additional staff? How can the scheme benefit the small farmers of Scotland without extra staff being employed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The benefit lies in the work that is done for them, and that work, obviously, will have to be paid for. I should have thought that the hon. Member would have been on the same wavelength as I, and would have rejoiced in the fact that we do not need many more staff. I do not say that we shall not need any more staff, but, broadly speaking, we believe that we will be able to carry out the scheme, and help the small farmer, with the present staff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord has just said that Secretaries of State are not specifically defined unless more than one is concerned, but is it not the fact that the Secretary of State for the Home Department is involved in the Bill? He is responsible, I believe, for Northern Ireland. As a matter of fact, on the back of the Bill, " Mr. Secretary Butler " comes before " Mr. Secretary Maclay ".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on a very fair point, and, perhaps, he will allow my noble Friend and me to look into this aspect between now and the Report stage. Neither of us pretends to be an expert on drafting, and we should like time to consider this. I give the hon. Gentleman full credit for his astuteness.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) has asked an important question about the Ministry's offices in Wales. It is true that some offices have been closed, following the reorganisation of the Department and, frankly, I hope that it will not be necessary to reopen offices. However, if that be found necessary for the effective working of the scheme, we shall do it. I do not think that that necessity will arise as, in the main, it should be possible to transact business with divisional officers through the post. The important thing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
is that farmers will have direct access to their local office of the N.A.A.S. Furthermore, as I am sure the hon. and learned Gentleman well knows, these discussions normally take place on the farm. However, we will keep a close watch on the position.</span></p>

New Clause.—(ADVISORY COMMITTEE.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>For the purpose of giving advice and assistance to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the discharge of his functions under this Act, there shall be constituted an advisory committee and the members thereof shall be appointed by the Minister who shall have power to determine its constitution.—[<i>Mr. Willey</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up and read the First time</i>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary expected to see this new Clause on the Order Paper, as we have raised this matter on previous Bills. I want, first of all, to deal with the National Farmers' Union. Whilst we all welcome the advice received from that organisation, and wish to encourage it in that respect, on this occasion I very much regret that it has stated its strong opposition to this new Clause. I appreciate, of course, that the National Farmers' Union so consistently supports the Opposition that it must have welcomed an occasion to disagree with us——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They always vote against us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The N.F.U. advance two arguments against the new Clause. It says, first, that, in the Price Review, there is already machinery for discussion between the producers and the Government. We recognise that, but as it has nothing to do with this proposal I shall say no more about it.<br><br>
The second argument is that the union appreciate our case, and is itself providing for a committee. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>" Accordingly the Union has itself taken steps to set up a special Committee to keep a close watch on the progress of the Scheme and to be responsible for the conduct of further discussions with the Government on its details both before and after the Statutory Instrument is drawn up."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0850">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
I welcome that—there is no reason at all why the National Farmers' Union should not set up a committee if it thinks that that will be helpful—but, with great respect to the N.F.U., it is really offensive for it to say that because of its setting up its own committee there is no need for the Government to do anything more about it. It shows an entire disregard of, and a lack of responsibility in relation to the position of the industry. While I welcome the initiative of the National Farmers' Union, I cannot accept the proposition that because it has taken this step there is no need for the Committee, or the House to consider it, or for the Government to take any action.<br><br>
I turn now to the Government. The Government cannot be so prejudiced against the new Clause, because the Parliamentary Secretary himself will recognise that it is in terms similar to those of a new Clause that I moved when we were discussing the 1957 Agriculture Bill. The Government then said that they had anticipated my new Clause, and had established such a committee. We know that the noble Lord, then the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, was Chairman of that Committee, which was set up to deal with problems arising under Part II of the l957 Bill.<br><br>
The only issue before us was, therefore—recognising that our purposes were identical—whether we should seek to make statutory provision for a committee of that sort. We recognised that, as the Government had set one up, there was no need to press further to provide for it in the Bill. We have not got that position here, and must, therefore, press the new Clause.<br><br>
I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary of what he said when we discussed the new Clause, dealing only with Part II, during the Committee stage of the Agriculture Bill in 1957. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>" … our feeling is that this committee has been set up administratively and that shows that our intentions are, at any rate, honourable in that respect."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise that there was no difference in principle between us on our approach to this suggestion. The hon. Gentleman went on to say that the purpose of the committee was to
<br><blockquote><p>" … direct the powers of the officials who have to administer this Measure."—[OFFICIAL
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A</i>, 14th May, 1957; c. 374–5.]</p></blockquote>
Again, I emphasise that the very reason for our suggesting an advisory committee here is to
<br><blockquote><p>" … direct the powers of the officials who have to administer this Measure."</p></blockquote>
I hope that, in these circumstances, the hon. Gentleman will recognise that there is a very good case for an advisory committee. We have established a committee in relation to the farm improvements scheme. We are now discussing a new Measure rather similar in character, but which will bring greater administrative difficulties, and I believe that there is an unanswerable case for setting up an advisory committee in one form or another. I have no particular views as to the form that the advisory committee should take, but if we look at the history of the other committee we know that it has been of considerable assistance. It has met several times, and has made the 1957 Act more effective, and easier to administer.<br><br>
I hope that, learning from that experience, the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that here again there is a case for a similar committee. The form and shape of it I leave to him, but there is certainly a case for it. We have a precedent, of course, if we wish to look for one, in the Hill Farming Act, under which an advisory committee was established in very similar circumstances. This is not a matter about which we can be doctrinaire.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
I conclude with this argument, which I have put often in this room. We are anxiously concerned about the working of democracy. We are anxiously concerned about the relations between the bureaucracy and the people affected by its administration. Here is something which is bound to cause sore feelings among people and cause difficulties. If we had an assurance that, behind those administering the scheme, there was an advisory committee which could advise on the administration and also advise the Government on any amendments which could be made, I am sure that that would meet the wish of most hon. Members of the Committee. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept it. Whether it be necessary to incorporate it in the Statute or not really depends upon his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0851">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
reply and his attitude towards it, but I hope that he will accept the principle and establish, as soon as possible, an appropriate committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Archer Baldwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the intention behind this new Clause. Whether it should remain in its present form or not is a matter for my hon. Friend.<br><br>
In my view, a practical man should be called in by the N.A.A.S. to help it in deciding cases put before it. I feel that this would not only be of extreme value to the N.A.A.S. in its work, but it would expedite the scheme itself. I understand that the district committees which were used during the war are still in existence, but they do not function. I should have thought that it would be better to set up new district committees so that the N.A.A.S. should—not might—call in one of these practical men to help in any scheme which comes forward.<br><br>
I do not suggest that the N.A.A.S. is not competent, but so many of the advisory officers are not practical men. It would help them tremendously if they had a farmer who knew his job, a practical man, to assist in vetting any scheme which was put in front of them. It would expedite matters and it would even pave the way to other schemes, which I hope that my hon. Friend will not wait for two or three years to introduce. I hope that he will not wait to see how this one works but will bring in another scheme within six months, as was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan). I am quite sure that, if such a committee were formed and used, it would expedite the scheme and would be of great assistance to the N.A.A.S.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the speech of the hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin). I am quite sure that he has got the right point of view here. As I have said many times, I feel very strongly that arrangements are made sometimes between Government Departments, which means Government bureaucrats, to a great extent—I attach no blame to them in using that word; it happens to be the convenient description of them—and representatives of the producers. Apart from that, there is the general public whom we represent here.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
We cannot always represent the interests of those concerned in every aspect of any scheme which has to be administered by a Government Department. Very often, we find ourselves, as back benchers at any rate, confronted with Measures or orders which have been arranged beforehand between the Department and an outside organisation, and a <i>fait accompli</i> is presented to us here. I feel that what is proposed in the new Clause would provide an adequate safeguard for everyone concerned, and I ask the Minister to accept it, or something like it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will accept the new Clause and that on Report he will put in additional words to provide that we shall have similar advisory committees for Scotland. In saying that, I stress that the arguments which have been advanced already apply with equal force to Scotland. We are very anxious that there should be advisory committees and that we should enlist in Scotland all the available agricultural experience, technical capacity and brains. I can cite the example of various committees which are now in operation. I understand that the Government attach considerable importance to the need for making the Bill a success in Scotland, although their intention is not revealed by the fact that there is not one single extra official to be appointed there.<br><br>
I submit that the argument about advisory committees is much strengthened by a reading of the Appendix to the Blue Book on agriculture in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Diamond. I do not in the least want to avoid doing my duty in answering points made about Scotland, but I wonder whether this is in order. This is a new Clause entirely about advice to the Minister of Agriculture, and I am not sure whether it is in order without a similar new Clause mentioning the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is in order. This is the Second Reading of the new Clause. We can discuss the matter in principle, and I have no knowledge of what Amendments might be inserted at a later stage when we come to discuss it from that point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0852">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. Diamond. I should not like to have been out of order on that point. I assure the noble Lord that I spend a great deal of time trying to keep this side of the Committee within the bounds of order-not only on the borderline, but on the right side.<br><br>
I was going to argue that experience in Scotland in appointing advisory committees would be of benefit to the Minister in England. In view of our efficient system of agriculture in Scotland, the English Minister could very well learn from the constitution of these advisory committees which exist in Scotland. If the noble Lord will turn to the Report of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland for 1957, he will see that there are already advisory committees doing extremely useful work. On these advisory committees are very many farmers who have been enrolled from many different parts of Scotland.<br><br>
I certainly cannot go over all the different advisory committees which exist, but I suggest that, in view of the fact that the small farmers have been specially designated and have a special Bill. they are entitled to a special advisory committee. There are men on the advisory committees which already exist who would be quite prepared to put their services at the disposal of the Government if an advisory committee were accepted. There is the general Scottish Agricultural Advisory Council, the Scottish Agricultural Improvement Council, the Grassland Committee and there is a list of committees, seventeen in all, which advise the Government on the various aspects of agriculture in Scotland.<br><br>
There is the Scottish Poultry Advisory Committee. Surely, the Scottish small farmers are just as much entitled to an advisory committee as are Scottish poultry. There is the Hill Farming Advisory Committee, which has such a special knowledge of marginal land and the problems of small farmers on marginal land. If the Minister does not want to form another Committee, why not call upon the experience of these gentlemen and switch them over to an advisory committee on the problems of Scottish small farmers? That would be a very commonsense step to take. We have an advisory committee on artificial insemination, which, I believe, is doing very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
useful work. The members of this committee would, no doubt, be quite prepared to put their knowledge at the disposal of small farmers.<br><br>
I mention these things because it is well recognised that advisory committees are called in to deal with the very wide ramifications of agricultural problems affecting Scotland. If the small farmers are so important, they are surely entitled to their advisory committee. There is the Pig Improvement Advisory Committee. Surely, the Government does not attach less importance to this scheme than it does to pig improvement. The Bill is, in substance, intended to improve small farms. If the Government have an advisory committee to improve pigs in Scotland, and they have also a Licensing of Bulls Advisory Committee in Scotland, why on earth can we not have an advisory committee to deal with these problems which will demand examination and call for a good deal of knowledge and experience?<br><br>
I could go on and argue the matter at some length, but I think that the point is made. If there is an advisory committee concerned with the licensing of potatoes, there should certainly be one to deal with the problems of the small farmer. I really cannot see why the Government should not accept an advisory committee to deal with these problems when they have an advisory committee for the licensing bulls.<br><br>
I know that the noble Lord is always ready with very strong arguments in answer to questions which are put, but what can be his reason for refusing an advisory committee in this matter? I presume that, if the English Minister is enlightened enough to accept what is proposed in the new Clause, it would automatically follow in Scotland. We should do something to end the feeling of frustration which is coming to be felt by farmers in Scotland. Their powers on the agricultural committees have been reduced, and there is a great deal of knowledge and experience which could be tapped. If this Bill is to be a success I fail to see why the Minister should not welcome with open arms this new Clause.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Member's point about Scotland is quite simple. If at any time the advice of these advisory committees is needed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0853">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
connection with the small farmersscheme, it will be asked. I do not quite understand what the hon. Member is getting at. It seems, for instance, that a poultry advisory committee would be a good body of which to ask advice in terms of a small farm, just as much as in terms of a big farm. We do not need special committees for small farmers. We have them under different headings and advice can be asked for on their particular subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to address myself to points raised by hon. Members south of the Border. I have listened with great care and a great deal of sympathy to the points which have been put forward. I think that the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) to be fair, will acquit me of being averse to committees. Indeed, on occasion he has accused me of being too fond of setting up committees. On this occasion we seem to have reversed our rô1es. I have given great thought and listened with great care to what he said.<br><br>
I should like to deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin), which I think is an important one. It is necessary to have advice of the very good men he referred to on district committees and the valuable work they have done. What my hon. Friend said is exactly in line with what my right hon. Friend has envisaged and put into motion. He looks not only to A.E.C.s, but also to district committee members to play a big part in running this scheme. My right hon. Friend, when speaking to county chairmen and A.E.C. members, has stressed this point; and over a large number of counties in the last few months I too have stressed the importance of their being consulted whenever the need arises.<br><br>
That is fully in the minds of our officers, and our county chairmen are urged to see that their district members are made fully aware of all the terms of the Scheme so that they can be consulted on the spot in relation to a farm of which they have personal knowledge. I give my hon. Friend the firm assurance that the point he made is fully taken and we agree with what he has in mind. But that is not quite the same point as the hon. Member for Sunderland, North had in mind. He was thinking in terms of a statutory committee, a few people located in London
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
and called upon to advise on the general progress of the Scheme.<br><br>
The hon. Memlber has taken note of the views of the N.F.U. in relation to this. We also take note of those views. On occasion the hon. Member vehemently supports the views of the N.F.U., but at other times he finds it necessary to take the other side. I find myself in the same position. There are occasions when I warmly welcome its opinions, but there are other times when I take the opposite view. The N.F.U. says that it is strongly opposed to this new Clause and it has said:
<br><blockquote><p>" For what is an operation exciusiveiy within the structure of the guarantees under the Agriculture Acts, 1947 and 1957, it is considered that it would be wholly inappropriate to extend what is already adequately provided for in the existing statutory provision for consultations with the producers."</p></blockquote>
The N.F.U. also refers to the committee which it has sat up. I take note of the view of the N.F.U., but I must also make clear that while the N.F.U. is fully at liberty and quite right to set up its own committee, that of itself must not exclude the right and duty of Parliament. While there is a statutory obligation on the Government under Section 2 of the 1947 Act to consult with producers, that does not exclude them from the right to consult with others. At the same time, in this case, apart from the way in which the view is phrased, I think there is a great deal of merit in the point of view the N.F.U. has put forward.<br><br>
What we are doing here is not really comparable with what we were doing under the Farm Improvement Scheme. That was something which ranged over a very wide field. There might have been a large number of matters on which people of many different outlooks and in different professions could be brought in for advice. Even then we did not set up a statutory committee, but provided administratively for what hon. Members opposite wished us to provide statutorily.<br><br>
Takng the point about statutory committees first, before going on to the question of whether we should have a committee or not, I say definitely that in matters of this sort I always prefer a non-statutory committee. Once one has been set up statutorily for what might be something lasting a relatively short period, one is left with that committee. It is still on the Statute Book and one is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0854">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
forced to call it together whether it has any business or not. The cobwebs have to be brushed off and there is no business for it to perform. In a matter like this, where there is no regular continuing business, it is better that it should 'be a non-statutory committee.<br><br>
To the question of whether there should be a committee or not, my right hon. Friend has given very careful thought and come to the view that it would not be appropriate or necessary in this case. What would such a committee be called upon to decide? These are matters where the decisions, particularly in relation to particular problems, are those on which our advisory services from the technical viewpoint are advising the small farmer and taking the advice of the local practical farmer.<br><br>
The only matters with which an advisory committee would be directly concerned would be at the two ends ot the scale, as to whether farms should be in or outside the Scheme. That is what it would boil down to. We have ample opportunity through our ordinary county committees and advisory services for this purpose. At the end of the day it might be said that there should be a committee, but these are matters which should be decided directly by the Minister himself.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend has made it plain that in introducing this Scheme he has had to take decisions which to some have perhaps appeared harsh, but which are necessary if a scheme is to be effective. He must have his hands completely free and untied in relation to the question of where he should set the boundary lines. In a speech earlier in this Committee he indicated that he may later have to look at the limits of this Scheme, but it should be within the Minister's own powers to decide who is within and who is without a scheme. For those reasons, I do not think it would be appropriate to have an advisory body on a matter of pure administration, which this will be.<br><br>
There is the safeguard of the county committees themselves. They can be fully consulted on every individual case where doubt exists. That, I think, is the safeguard which is necessary and the need for which I think was in the mind of the hon. Member who moved the Second Reading of this Clause. If the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
county committees had not been there, there might have been a case for the Clause, but as we have the county committees I do not think there is a case for it. Having full opportunity provided, not only for them to be consulted, but for use to be made of district committees in the normal run, it would not be necessary to have a committee—statutory or otherwise—in relation to this problem. That is the view my right hon. Friend takes. For that reason I could not advise the Committee to accept the new Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very thoughtful reply from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary. The trouble is that the more thoughtful he becomes the less enterprising he is. I might almost wish that we had had a superficial reply. I appreciate at once some of the arguments he has advanced and I certainly recognise the importance of the county committees. I recognise that this is an occasion on which he has the N.F.U. with him—a rare occasion for the Government—and I can understand that he is reluctant to lose that advantage. I noticed he was not very enthusiastic in supporting the arguments of the National Farmers' Union, but rested his case on other grounds. I wish to turn to those other grounds.<br><br>
I think we all realise that the details of the Bill depend upon committee work. We should recognise this. In detail it was not the inspiration of the Minister. It depended on advice given throughout committee. Where we have such advice is should be recognised. If we recognise that this Bill depends on technical assistance and advice given from within and without the Department, we should recognise that its implementation—if the Minister is to take decisions—is likely to depend on such advice and assistance. It is better to recognise that. It improves the status of the people giving advice.<br><br>
On the argument of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary that this is a provision which allows less scope than Part II of the 1957 Act, I fully agree. In a sense this will be easier to administer than the 1957 Act because it will call for less discretion. Therefore, there is less ground for providing advice from an advisory committee, but the Joint Parliamentary Secretary recognised that there are borderline cases. It would have been as well, I should have thought, to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0855">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
have the assistance and guidance of an advisory committee to guide the Department in those cases.<br><br>
The further argument, which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has not really met, is that here we are dealing with the evolution of policy. The hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) has asked for a new Bill. The Minister and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary have both said they will keep an open mind on the matter and may have to introduce a new scheme. I think we should encourage the right hon. Gentleman and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to be open-minded. If so, it is a good thing for them to have the advice of such a committee. We cannot be persuaded by what the hon. Gentleman has said in his reply. I think it very disappointing. It is very disappointing when we have new procedures to establish such as this and do not have an anxiety to provide for some element, outside the bureaucracy, to give advice and assistance.<br><br>
I concede that if such a committee were set up it would be better if it were a non-statutory committee. I expressed this view when I moved the Second Reading of the new Clause. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary is on a good point when he says there will be some disadvantages in setting up such a committee expressly by the terms of the Statute. Particularly whilst we are in sight of Christmas, I would not wish to press this Motion to a Division. I further pay great attention to what my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) said about the position in Scotland. We would have to reconsider this provision if we were seeking to incorporate it in the Bill.<br><br>
I concede that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary is on strong grounds when he says that such a committee would be better established as a non-statutory committee. I hope he will spend part of the vacation rereading this part of our proceedings and that he may seek the occasion of having further discussions with both sides of the Committee particularly interested in establishing such procedure. I hope that before the Bill comes into operation he will have changed his mind and recognised the need for some form of committee which would meet an anxiety which is shared not only on this side of the Committee. I take the silence
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to mean that he is not averse to such a course. In view of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion and Clause, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
<p><i>Schedule agreed to</i>.</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the Bill, as amended, be reported to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godber</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, before we depart from the Bill, may I, on behalf of myself, my right hon. Friend and my noble Friend and I am sure on behalf of the whole Committee, give grateful thanks to you, Mr. Diamond for the way in which you have presided over our deliberations in this Committee? [HON. MEMBERS: " Hear, hear."] We have been a difficult and unruly body I know, but you, with your charm and tact, have kept us entirely within bounds—or almost entirely within bounds—and it has been a pleasure to sit under your Chairmanship. May I also say a word of thanks to hon. Members opposite who have assisted us with the passage of this Bill, and for the helpful observations they have made, at some stages at any rate, in its passage through Committee? I also say a word of thanks to officials, both your own, Mr. Diamond, and those of my own Department and of the Scottish Office, who have helped towards the speedy passage of this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I join the Parliamentary Secretary in all that he has said? Those of us who are members of the agricultural repertory will regard this as a short run. But it has been a very pleasant run, Mr. Diamond, because we have had the benign influence of your wise guidance, and it has not been unprofitable, because we have had some response from the right hon. Gentleman and his Parliamentary Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add a few words? I believe, Mr. Diamond, that you had rather more difficulty in a previous Bill, because this is a Bill to which Scotland has been tacked on. It is rather difficult for an English Member to understand the complexities of agriculture for Scotland. The noble Lord himself has had some difficulty, and it would be quite understandable for an English Member to be in some difficulty. I suggest that you might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V001P0I0856">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
pass on to the appropriate authority that, in view of the very large number of Members representing agricultural constituencies in Scotland who are vitally interested, it might ease the problem of any future Chairman if a separate Bill were introduced for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord John Hope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a word, I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has used this occasion—in which we all join, whether we speak or remain silent—in thanking
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
the Chairman, to make untimely points which are nothing whatever to do with this pleasant task.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to all sides of the Committee for the kindness they have shown.</span></p>
