	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I notice that in the OFFICIAL REPORT of our last sitting, Thursday, 19th February, the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. G. Longden) is recorded as having voted twice in Division No. 2, while I am not recorded as having voted at all. I hope that this error can be put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have the matter looked into and put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance (Miss Edith Pitt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were discussing at our last sitting a small matter raised by the hon. Member for Ince (Mr. T. Brown). Since then we have had a private discussion and I think that I have been able to clear it up to his satisfaction. He was concerned that anyone who in the course of his employment might have to take lower-grade work would suffer a loss of pension benefit. I assure him that that is not the case with the flat-rate benefit, which was mainly what was in his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady, but I am still rather confused about this matter after thinking it over during the week-end. I am concerned about what happens in the mining industry where there would be fluctuations in contributions due not to the Bill but to the nature of the miner's work. I tried to point out to the right hon. Gentleman the Minister this morning that this is an extremely difficult matter. He assures me that the man who earns above £9 will be assured of his flat-rate pension, but if his
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
earnings fall below £9 during that period what is the position about his pension? Will an average be struck of the flat-rate contribution and the graduated contribution in order to determine his pension when he retires?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it abundantly clear that, whatever his change of employment, as long as the person is employed in a particular week it makes no difference to his flat-rate benefit but only to the graduated contribution. If he earns above £9 he will be liable to the graduated contribution. If his earnings in a certain week fall below £9 there will be no contribution in respect of graduated benefit but he will pay the flat-rate contribution and that will count for his flat-rate benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that three or four times a year he might switch from one scheme to the other and that when he comes to draw his pension he will be penalised because occasionally during the year he has paid a graduated contribution. If occasionally he alternates between a flat-rate contribution and a graduated contribution how will his pension be determined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any event, he will have his flat-rate benefit and such graduated benefit as he has paid for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. A. Marquand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our last meeting, when we began discussion of Clause 1 as a whole, I put some questions to the Minister at some length and received from the hon. Lady the Joint Parliamentary Secretary a very brief reply indeed. We had hoped by this stage to have received full enlightenment on the finances of the Bill. I do not think that we feel that we have received that full enlightenment, but no doubt in the course of today's discussion we shall be able to have a fuller statement from the right hon. Gentleman. We certainly hope so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to begin, therefore, by explaining how we see it. The hon. Lady told me at our last sitting that there was certainly still to be a national insurance fund. It emerged from her reply that there is to be a fund of some size, starting as a very small one, though the Government Actuary's figures show that it will become considerably bigger in later years. But how big it is to be in the earlier
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
years and exactly what calls there will be upon it still remain rather uncertain from what the hon. Lady said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the fund is still so small that the possibility, for example, of only one month's arrears in contributions, which will total £22 million, will call for the special remedy provided for in the latter part of Clause 1 (3). On the other hand, we were told that if it happens-and we agree that it is a hypothetical supposition but not a wildly impossible thing to envisage-that unemployment, now at 28 per cent., should run for some time over the level of 3 per cent. which the Government Actuary has assumed we are not to worry because there are reserves in the Fund which would cover this contingency. Apparently, there will not be sufficient reserves in hand to cover the contingency of £22 million, which might arise from a lack of contributions for one month only, but the fund is big enough to cover an excess of unemployment over a longish period above the 3 per cent. level. It seems to me that even this short-term aspect of the fund, which must cover liability for unemployment and sickness as well as old age, is locked in mystery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's chief contribution at this stage was to draw my attention to Table 3 of the Government Actuary's Report, in which it is shown that during the first fifteen years of the currency of the new scheme, from 1961 to 1976, it is expected that there will be annual deficits in contributions from all sources or from £3 million to £4 million below expenditure. The total of contributions will be less than the total expenditure expected, sometimes by £3 million, sometimes by £4 million, and then back again to £3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Lady drew the attention of the Committee to Table 3, and I am perfectly prepared, for the sake of argument, to take the Government Actuary's own Table 3 as a basis for our examination of the finances proposed for the scheme. It throws a great deal of light on a ghost whose presence is not referred to in the Bill but whose immanence should pervade the whole discussion of the Bill's finances. I want to bring the ghost out into the light. He has some unappealing names. He is called "the emerging deficit" and even
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
"the uncovered liability". Perhaps it is the natural modesty of the Minister and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary that they do not want to look at this uncovered liability, this naked ghost, and do not want attention drawn to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the insurance scheme was designed, it included large numbers of persons whose contributions, because of their age, even when their employers' contributions were taken into account and a flat-rate supplement was payable by the State, could not meet a pension at sixty-five for a man and sixty for a woman. We included in the scheme at that time a very large number of persons of whom that was true. In spite of the fact that there were large numbers whose contributions would have to be very high if they were to cover the cost of the pension that was promised, it was agreed that nobody should be charged contributions which were more than were sufficient to cover the pension liability of a young person entering the scheme at sixteen, and paying throughout his working life, except for intermissions which might occasionally arise from sickness and unemployment. It was agreed at that time by Parliament that this large number of middle-aged and elderly people who could not qualify for pension on a basis of contribution then fixed should nevertheless, by the age of sixty-five and sixty, qualify for the full rate of pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament then assumed a large uncovered liability. It was certainly agreed in Parliament at the time when the Act was passed in that form. There was a solemn pledge by Parliament that, in spite of the fact that it had been decided not to levy on middle-aged and elderly people larger contributions than those paid by those entering the scheme at an early age, the uncovered liability which would eventually emerge would be met by the State. It was agreed with the T.U.C., which is very definite that the promise was given at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody knew that the deficit was bound to arise and everybody took for granted that when the time came the strength of the nation would be such that the taxpayer could meet the emerging deficit. Let us, therefore, look at Table 3 of the Government Actuary's Report. I will not go into all the details which might be obtained from calculations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
based on Table 2. I can simplify the matter, though I think it is rather in favour of the Government's case, by taking Table 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Government's own calculations, the Exchequer liability of the taxpayer would be in 1961–1966, £172 million. It is going to be reduced by this scheme to £3 million. In 1966 the liability, which if no change had been made by these proposals, would have been £258 million, will be reduced to only £4 million. During the next period, 1971–1976, a liability which would have been £338 million will be reduced to only £3 million. Not only is the liability during this first fifteen years going to be drastically reduced in this way in the last period by no less than £335 million, but eventually under the Government's proposals the liability is to be wiped out and a surplus is to be provided. The liability of £398 million disappears and is replaced by a credit of £10 million. In other words, the total Exchequer liability is wiped out and a surplus is provided towards the national insurance fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the magic of this? How is it possible to remove in this way an emerging cost which everybody agreed such a short time ago as 1946 would eventually fall upon the taxpayer? The magic is that the person who in future is to pay graduated contributions under these proposals is to pay the Exchequer liability. It does not come from an increase in the flat-rate contributions. Indeed, for a time the flat rate contributions are to be reduced and eventually when they are increased they are not to be increased above the present level. There is to be no increase in the flat-rate contributions and yet a reduction in the emerging cost to the Exchequer liability running after fifteen years to over £300 million. If there is no increase in the flat rate contributions, and if there is to be a wiping out of the Exchequer liability, there is only one conclusion to be drawn, and that is that the graduated contribution is to pay the Exchequer liability. Suddenly after all these years—I admit that there was a partial shift in the right bon. Gentleman's last Act, but I will not talk about that now because I do not want to introduce unnecessary complication—the Exchequer liability is to be placed on the shoulders of a selected group of tax-
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
payers; that is to say, people who earn between £9 and £15 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way this is done is vividly illustrated in Appendix 1 of the Government Actuary's Report. Let us take, for example, the extreme case and look at the situation as forecast by the Government actuary for the year 2001–2. In that year the graduated contribution coming from employed persons earning between £9 and £15 a week is estimated to be £265 million, and the graduated contribution from the employers of those persons is estimated to be £272 million, giving a total of £537 million. That will be paid in 2001 as contributions. How much will be paid in benefits? A little further down the table hon. Members will see that graduated benefits will be £199 million. The people will pay £537 million in contributions and receive £199 million in benefits. Similar figures can be seen for other years. For example, in 1981–1982 graduated contributions from employed persons will be £193 million, and from employers £198 million, giving a total of £391 million; and the graduated benefits will be £63 million. The same thing applies to the year 1971–2, which is not very far away now: contributions from employers and employed at graduated rates total £295 million, and benefits for the graduated contributors £16 million; they get £16 million for a payment of £295 million. That is how it is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot see any flaw whatever in this argument. The burden of liability fully undertaken by the taxpayer, by the Government of the day and by the Opposition of the day on behalf of the country in 1946 to meet the emerging cost of paying pensions for the elderly or middle-aged who entered the scheme in 1946 is to be met from now on under these proposals, to a gradually increasing extent, by a special tax on incomes of between £9 and £15 a week. That is the essence of the proposals in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) asked the right hon. Gentleman why he stops at £15 a week, and why he should not extend the graduated contributions further up the scale of income to, say, £50 a week, the right hon. Gentleman said that he thought that it would be unfair, or it would not be a proper discharge of the duty of the State, to compel people to make provision for their old age above
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
the level of £15 a week and that above that level of income they should make their own provision for their own old age. We do not agree with that concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what do hon. Members opposite Who agree with it think about this? Suppose they think it is not right to compel people who earn above £15 a week to make superannuation provision for their old age, and they ought to be left to make arrangements with the insurance companies, do they think it right that people earning between £9 and £15 a week should be paying for other people's pensions? If it is wrong to compel a man earning over £15 to make provision for his own pension, why is it right to make a man earning between £9 and £15 a week bear the cost of other people's pensions? There is the nub of the whole question and the essence of our criticism of these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot accept a proposal which in this way lays the burden solely upon this band of income. No wonder that the result of these proposals, which require contributions of £295 million from a selected group of contributors with a payment of only £16 million in benefit, or, as is required later, contributions of £537 million and only £200 million in benefit, is that individual contributors get less pension out of these proposals than they would get from private insurance. That is bound to be so under a financial system of that kind. My hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Cronin) during the Second Reading illustrated this effect upon the individual contributor of this method of financing the emerging deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he comes to discuss these matters, the right hon. Gentleman will no doubt say: " Yes; but face the facts. There is an emerging deficit. Tell us how you would propose to meet it. You are not going to reduce everybody's pension because an emerging deficit is coming along; in fact, you want to increase it. How would you deal with the problem? " No doubt he will point to the proposals which we put forward in our superannuation plan and will say that our plan provides for shifting some of the burden of the emerging deficit from the taxpayer to the contributor. I agree that, to some extent, we meet the problem of the emerging deficit, which is a rapidly growing one, by shifting some of the burden upon the contributor. But in
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
doing that we include a much wider range of contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the extent to which we do it is comparatively small, because we take account of two facts. First, we take account of the fact that we anticipate a steady increase in national income, and we are, therefore, able to look forward to a steady increase, in the amount of contributions on a percentage basis. We find an increase in the revenue from contributions without imposing any additional hardship on contributors. More than that, we in our proposals provide for maintaining the greater part of the obligation which was assumed in 1946; we provide for a substantial contribution by the State. In fixing the State contribution, we have provided for much larger sums of money than the right hon. Gentleman has done. If we assume—and now we are entitled to assume it—an annual increase in the wage bill of at least 2 per cent. per annum, our proposals work out——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not go into too much detail in regard to the alternative scheme, which does not appear in Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marquand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Blackburn, and if you observe the same rule, as I am sure you will, when the right hon. Gentleman is speaking, I shall not object. I accept your ruling, as I am bound to do, and I shall have no misgivings about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was merely going to say that a system such as the one we propose, which is firmly linked to rises in the national income and relates contribution by percentage increase to the size of the national income, enables the burden—without any injury to the taxpayer, because he is paying out of an increasing income the same percentage as he would pay before—still to remain where we think it ought to remain, namely, on the shoulders of the taxpayer. The right hon. Gentleman's proposal does not do this, but does the opposite. His proposal puts an increasing amount of the burden as it arises year by year on the shoulders of those earning between £9 and £15 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures I have already quoted prove clearly that the burden is not merely being placed upon the shoulders of these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
contributors but As being placed upon them to an increasing extent. I cannot use the figures which I was going to use, which would have indicated the extent to which, under our proposals, contributors would be assisted to receive reasonable benefits for their contributions; but I can and do say that a proposal which would place upon the taxpayer the burden of a sum amounting annually to 2 per cent. of income obviously would result in a much larger contribution from the taxpayer than a proposal which places upon the taxpayer a contribution of only 25 per cent. of other people's contributions. Obviously, 2 per cent. of national wages is a very much larger sum than 25 per cent. of contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman proposes 25 per cent. of contributions while we say 2 per cent. of wages should come from the State, and we suggest that in that way—if the right hon. Gentleman likes to borrow the suggestion he is very welcome—by making this contribution 2 per cent. of the wages, we shall remove a large part of the imperfections from the scheme. He should place the burden of emerging costs where it should lie. We believe that he could have taken his present proposals with the introduction of graded contributions and benefits had he wished and could have paid very much better benefits had he placed the whole of the burden of the emerging costs on the shoulders of the taxpayer. Under his scheme the emerging cost is no bigger than it was before, and had he placed that whole burden on the taxpayer, where we agreed in 1946 that it should be placed, the Exchequer could have born it without any increase whatsoever in taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend leaves the question of contributions, is it not the case that the Exchequer makes no contribution towards graduated contributions and that it is 25 per cent. on the flat rate only?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marquand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, and I thank my hon. Friend for underlining that. As he says, when I was talking about the proportion of contributions contributed by the Exchequer being not merely 25 per cent. of other people's contributions I should have said it was not merely that but 25 per cent. of the flat
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
rate contributions only. We believe that if the whole of the emerging cost of meeting all the pension liabilities for middle—aged and elderly people, as agreed in 1946, had been put on the Exchequer—no matter in what form-it could have been borne without any increase at all in taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it be true that the national income is going to increase—and we have no difficulty in accepting the figure of a 2 per cent. annual increment—then the present level of taxation would have been ample to cover the emerging cost of the Exchequer liability. There is no need at this time to shift this cost upon the contributors. The only reason for shifting, in the early days, almost the whole, and in later days, the whole of the emerging cost upon this band of incomes must be that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is anxious to relieve higher income taxpayers of a substantial burden as quickly as he possibly can. At any rate there can be no doubt that it is a deliberate shift of an emerging cost which we had understood was to be borne by the taxpayer, or to a limited class of taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the burden went all the way up the income scale it would not be so bad and our criticism would not be so fierce, although no doubt we should still criticise; but to suggest that it should be concentrated on incomes between £9 and £15 per week and that that should be defended by the argument that it is wrong to compel people to make provision for their old age seems to us to indicate completely fallacious reasoning. We are anxious to make clear throughout the country—we feel that it should be made clear—that the essence of the proposals before us today is a device to shift a burden which ought to be on the shoulders of the nation as a whole on to a narrowly-chosen group of low-income people—people earning between £9 and £15 a week. No one can say that that is an extraordinary income at the present time. After all, it is very much less than we ourselves receive from our parliamentary duties, even when we have met all our expenses. We do not see why the burden should be concentrated on this very narrow sector of earners in industry who are none too well off and who have, perhaps, an adequate standard of life but no more. It is upon them and their children, by taking from them their ability to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
look after their children as they should be able to look after them, that Her Majesty's Government are placing the burden of paying pensions for the middle ages and elderly, a burden which could well be borne by the national income without any increase at all in taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. E. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister a few questions about the assumptions made by Her Majesty's Government in drawing up Clause 1, but before doing so I should like to make one comment in support of my right hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Marquand). I feel, as he did, that Clause 1, particularly subsection (3), is obviously the heart of the Bill and that the main intention of the Bill is to shift the burden in the way that he has illustrated.

My right hon. Friend pointed to the Appendix to the Report of the Government Actuary and quoted the figures for graduated contributions in the year 2,000–2. I have been doing a little sum arising out of those figures from which it seems to emerge that the amount that will be paid then in respect of graduated contributions will be £338 million more than the amount paid out in graduated contributions. That is a very startling and large figure, but I believe it ties up with Table 2 on page 7 of the Report which shows that a similar amount is to be saved to the Exchequer by the operation of the Exchequer supplement. If we look at the figures for the year 2,001–2, we see that the Exchequer liability in that year under the proposed scheme is to be £216 million; but if the present scheme went on without any alteration in its basic rules until that year the Exchequer liability would be a supplement of £136 million, then meeting a deficit of £384 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doing another sum, that would add up to £520 million. So the effect of the Bill is to reduce the Exchequer liability in that year to £304 million. It shows that after the scheme has been in operation for forty years there is a burden of just over £300 million lifted from general taxation and put on to the shoulders of the £9–£15 a week group. When I speak of the burden being put on their shoulders I am taking account of the fact that they get graduated pensions; but taking that
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
from what they will have paid, they will still carry that extra burden. Her Majesty's Government are not even entitled to claim for this that it is a saving to the Exchequer. It is merely a shift from the general body of taxpayers to a particular group of taxpayers because in the main the graduated contribution is a new form of taxation. The graduated benefits are so small that that is what it amounts to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put one or two questions to the Minister on the way in which he has worked out his figures and particularly as to the assumptions on which the Government Actuary was told to work. I am looking now at page 5, paragraph 13, of his Report. He said that on Government instructions he had worked on three assumptions. It seems to me that all three assumptions are questionable and certainly need a lot of explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first concerns unemployment. We are told there has been an assumption since 1951 of a level of 4 per cent. long-term unemployment. That 4 per cent. was based on a safety margin, the actual level of unemployment being between 1 per cent. and 2 per cent., in fact nearer to 1 per cent. for the greater part of the period; so that there was a safety margin. We are now to reduce the assumption to 3 per cent.—in the very year in which unemployment doubles. It seems an extraordinary time to choose to reduce the assumption. The real level of unemployment now is about 3 per cent. In other words, under the new assumption there is to be no safety margin at all. Surely in view of the fact that, at long last, the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government is "coming home to roost" and unemployment is increasing, we ought to increase the figure for that assumption rather than reduce it to the real level. I feel that we ought to hear a little more on why that assumption was changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second assumption was that there would be a rise in the level of earnings of 2 per cent. per annum. That is all very well and certainly it ought to happen if we have reasonably intelligent direction of our economic affairs. But is it not rather absurd to assume that the level of earnings will go up and that, therefore. Her Majesty's Government can base their calculation regarding contributions on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
that assumption and assume, at the same time, that the level of benefits stands still? Clearly, if the level of earnings throughout the country is going up even a Conservative Government will be bound, sooner or later, to recognise that the pensioners' share must go up too. It would make some sense if the sum were done on the basis of static pensions and static contributions, and still more sense on the basis of assuming that both contributions and pensions would go up; but to do the sum on the assumption that contributions go up steadily on this basis but Chat benefits will stand still makes no sense and the whole of the arithmetic on which it is based is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third assumption is that the number of people in non-participating employment will be 2½ million. We were told in the White Paper last year that the number of people in private schemes was about 6½ million, and I feel that we should hear from the Minister why it is assumed that only about one-third will not participate in the Government scheme. He cannot very well tell us that in view of the level of benefits offered by the Government scheme it is one which competes with private schemes, and one can only assume that he feels the Government scheme is so ludicrous that a majority of people will treat it with contempt and say, " We may as well have this on top of the private scheme." I believe we should be told why this assumption has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to ask the Minister in what way he envisages the machinery in Clause 1 being adapted to changes in rates. He has told us, as he told the House on Second Reading and in the debate on the White Paper, that this was a machinery Bill and not a Bill to deal with rates, and that, if necessary, there could be other Bills to deal with rates of pension. It is up to him, therefore, to explain how this machinery Bill will operate in the long run and be adaptable to changes in rates. One thing which is clear from our experience over the last couple of generations is that rates of benefit cannot stay still very long. All kinds of things change—the cost of living changes and the general level of wealth of the community changes; and the pensioners are entitled to demand an increase to keep their share in an increasing standard of living. Our conceptions of how to deal with the elderly people and
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
widows change, too. All those things produce changes in pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of those on this side of the Committee the present rate of benefit are out of date now and should be increased, but presumably even in the view of hon. Members opposite the time will come when the present rates of contribution will be considered out of date. That time may have arrived before 1961, when this scheme is due to come into effect. How would this very complicated and rather clumsy machinery in Clause 1 be adapted to that necessity? If there was to be an increase in benefits, would Her Majesty's Government think in terms of widening the £9-£15 a week range and perhaps rasing the limit beyond the £15 a week people? If so, it would mean a fairly fundamental amendment of this Bill—an amendment of machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Government think in terms of raising the 8½ per cent. on graduated contributions? If so, again, it would be a rather fundamental alteration of the Bill. Would they think in terms of a further extension of the temporary supplements from the Exchequer dealt with in subsection (3, 	<i>c</i>)? From what the hon. Lady the Joint Parliamentary Secretary told us on Thursday morning, I rather gathered that would not be the case. She told us they were making a temporary extension of that kind of supplement which under present legislation would have to expire in 1960, or it could go on until 1962 if necessary, but I gathered that that is not envisaged as a long-term method of dealing with the necessary alterations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main Exchequer supplement is tied to the flat rate. In subsection (3) we are told that it would be a quarter of the flat rate paid by employers and employed persons and a third of that paid by self-employed and non-employed. The only way of raising that supplement would be by raising the flat rate first. We are left with the assumption that the only simple way in which the machinery can be adapted is by raising the flat rate. This is something on which the Minister should comment in detail. It means that the temporary modest reduction in the flat rate for the lowest paid will be very temporary indeed—even more temporary than it is already by reason of subsection (2) of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. W. Reynolds</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although at the moment we are discussing the whole Clause, I wish to confine my remarks mainly to that part dealing with the Exchequer supplement, and I have one or two other points to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (3) of the Clause we are making fundamental alterations to the whole concept of the tripartite insurance system we have had for many years whereby the employee, the employer and the Exchequer join together to bear the cost. Before coming here this morning, I took the opportunity of looking at the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) when he was moving the Second Reading of the National Insurance Bill in 1946. Incidentally, I found that in one of the copies of that speech in the Library a certain portion dealing with the cost of living index was heavily scored and underlined. Obviously it had been looked at by a large number of hon. Members opposite. The portion I looked at was not marked in any way. It was the section giving details, in 1946, of what the Exchequer liability would be in terms of pounds, shillings and pence in 1948, 1958, 1968 and 1978
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend pointed out on the 1946 Bill that the emerging deficit-which I understood was accepted by all parties in the House at that time was the Exchequer liability under the benefits and contributions rates-would be £190 million in 1958, £322 million in 1968 and £416 million in 1978. Those were the sums actually mentioned as falling on the Exchequer in those years. I was under the impression that these figures had been accepted and that the duty of meeting the liability had been accepted by all parties in the House. I now find that as the insurance scheme stands at the moment and prior to the introduction of this Bill, the actual liability for 1958 was about £139 million—£50 million less than was estimated in 1946—by 1968 it will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
£360 million—which is slightly more than was estimated in 1946—and, by 1978, it will be £520 million—a matter of £100 million more than was estimated in 1946
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But one has to take into account the fact that £416 million in 1946 would be a heavier liability than £520 million with the £ at its present value. So, even at the moment the Exchequer has to anticipate in future a smaller real burden on it to meet the emerging deficit on national insurance than was accepted by all parties in 1946
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As recently as 1954 the present Government accepted that liability, and in the Act of 1954 they made provision to meet the deficit over a period of five years. We are asked to extend this for a longer period. Even up to 1954 the fact that these emerging deficits were to be carried by the Exchequer and not by the contributor was accepted by both parties. Now we have a change and under the Bill the deficit is to be met by a total charge on the Exchequer which for the current year will remain unchanged at about £139 million, but for 1968 and 1978 it will remain at approximately £170 million. In other words, instead of being prepared as at present to meet £360 million in 1968, it has to meet only £170 million and instead of being prepared to meet £520 million in 1978, it is to meet only £190 million. My right hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Marquand) has explained this morning whence the difference between those two amounts comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take the assumption of 2 per cent. per annum increase in wages and things of that nature, we find that in 1958 the figure was £270 million, in 1968 it will be £330 million and in 1978 there will be approximately £440 million to be met from the Exchequer. If the proposals contained in the document referred to so often in this Committee were put into effect—I refer to the Labour Party's national superannuation scheme—assuming a 2 per cent. increase, the sum to be found by the Exchequer in 1978 would be about £440 million. I shall not refer further to that, but I thought we should get those figures on the record if at all possibles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having decided to make these quite substantial reductions in Exchequer contributions, the Government have broken the agreement which everyone accepted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
in 1946 and which was accepted as late as 1954. They now tell us, in the debate we had on the Gracious Speech a few months ago, in the debate on the White Paper, in the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill and in reply to a Question I put to the Minister, that approximately £170 million will be put in by the Exchequer every year and that under the new system of insurance it will be used to subsidise lower paid workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a point I should like the Minister to explain more fully to us. The amount of Exchequer contribution to meet the deficit is to be considerably reduced. Yet we are told at the same time—I find it very hard to believe—that because of the other payments made the reduced sum will be used to a much greater extent to subsidise the lower paid worker than is done under the present scheme. Take the case of someone who is earning £9 a week or less at present. When the scheme starts, he will have a reduction in his contributions. The only amount to be paid by the Exchequer will be 25 per cent. of his reduced contribution, because it goes in a lump sum of £170 million. In the make-up of the £170 million, 25 per cent. will go in for each contributor, yet the Minister tells us that pretty well the whole £170 million will be used to subsidise those with £9 a week and less. The Minister also tells us that the actuarial basis of the national insurance scheme as we know it at present is to be abolished and we are to go on to a pay-as-you-go method. That is for the whole scheme, but the benefits which the man earning under £9 a week is to receive are not being changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know exactly how much it is to cost to provide those benefits for someone entering the scheme at sixteen years of age and earning less than £9 a week throughout his working life. The cost of providing those benefits is exactly the same as in the existing scheme. What is needed from an actuarial point of view is 168·6d. a week. That figure is provided in the Actuary's Report on the 1957 Bill. There has been no change in these benefits since then and no change is proposed in this Bill. The cost of providing the full benefits for the person earning under £9 a week is 1686d. per week and for anyone coming in at sixteen, provided he earns £9 a week or less throughout his whole working life, this would be enough
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
money to cover the cost of the benefit. The employer and employee are to pay in for that insured person 139d. per week towards the 168·6d. and all that is required from the Exchequer is 29·6d. At present the Exchequer is paying into the national insurance fund for every insured man 29d. per week. What is needed to balance the account is 29·6d. So far as I can see, the only additional benefit to the under-£9-a-week man will be this 06d. a week throughout the whole of his working life. That is all that is needed over and above what the Exchequer is paying out at the moment to meet the cost of his pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot get out of this by saying that the actuarial basis does not follow, because after the Bill has gone through the under-£9-a-week man will get the same benefit as he is getting now, and so the cost of providing it will be the same. Unless the Minister can give a far more detailed explanation which will satisfy me about the mysterious means by which this £170 million is directed towards the under-£9-a-week man, I cannot believe that the 06d. makes up the total amount. I am forced to the conclusion that the £170 million per annum and the additional contributions form the amount required to meet the deficit which is emerging all the time in the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is using contributions from incomes of between £9 and £15 a week and a substantial chunk of the £170 million to meet the deficit. I do not object to that, but I object to the constant repetition that the £170 million is to subsidise the £9 a week man. The Minister has already said that about five times, but he has not backed it with figures. He is evidently wishing to convince the country solely by constant repetition that the £170 million is to provide better pensions for the poor man, but he will not convince me unless he gives definite figures. I hope he will give us the figures. Two sittings ago I said that I would raise this matter. The Committee should now be given more information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Gough) also claims to be a considerable expert, so ? have no doubt that when I sit down he will be able to tell us that the Government scheme is fair and perpetrates no injustice on anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to concentrate still on the finance of the scheme, but more on the provisions of Clause 1 (2), which deals with the five-yearly raising of the contributions. As I understand it, the flat-
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
rate contribution is to be raised without any corresponding increase in the benefits. This increase in contributions applies also to the graduated part of the scheme, with which I am now rather more concerned and about which I should like further information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 6 of the Government Actuary's Report, the present estimate is that in the graduated part of the scheme there will be paid in contributions a brick, or half a brick, of £7 10s. 0d., the employer paying another £7 10s. 0d. That amounts to £15 for each 6d. a week of the ultimate pension. In each of the five-yearly periods—if I am wrong in this, I hope to be corrected—there will be a percentage rise in the graduated contribution. It is clear, therefore, that the £15 will be increased, but there is nothing to suggest that the 6d. will be increased. Are we to understand that over the five-yearly periods more and more money will have to be put towards that eventual 6d. in the pension? Is that the case? If it is, what is the justification for it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite should keep very much in mind that, if there is any accuracy at all in what we are told, the recognition of the injustices of the scheme by those who are compelled to be in the graduated part of the scheme will leave them with a very deep-seated sense of grievance. Feeling that sense of grievance, they are bound to demand compensatory wage increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that a large part of the objective of the scheme is to overcome inflationary pressure. The scheme is described as being non-inflationary, as compared with other methods. I say in all sincerity to hon. Members opposite that the workers' recognition of the inherent injustice cannot but provoke them into making very definite and strenuous demands for compensatory wages increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will be more than ever the case when it is recognised how unfairly those earning from £9 to £15 a week are treated within the scheme in comparison with those who are outside it and in private pension schemes. I understand from the Government Actuary's Report that of those in existing private schemes, about one-third enjoy the benefits of a non-contributory basis. The ordinary workmen in the Government scheme must know that the money to pay the pensions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
paid in the private schemes to those who have not contributed must have come from somewhere. They will recognise that it has come either in the form of Income Tax rebates, or subsidies, or in the form of increased prices to the consumers. The money does not come out of the hat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like one of the experts on the other side to tell us where we are wrong; and how a scheme that is contributory to the hilt can be described as non-inflationary while others are inflationary. I do not argue against occupational schemes—by all means let us have more of them—but when it is appreciated by those in the Government scheme, as it will be, that many of those in the private schemes make no contributions towards them but will, in many cases, get very much better benefits than will the workers in the graduated scheme—the money having come, as I say, from Inland Revenue subsidies, Income Tax rebates, or from prices higher than would otherwise be necessary—there cannot but be this most indignant demand for compensatory wage increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would certainly be inflationary. I should like the Minister to tell us something more. Much more, at this stage, I should like one of the hon. Members opposite, who are so expert in these matters, to tell us where we are wrong—if we are wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am opposed to the whole scheme, I must speak against the Clause. Nowadays, when a Government bring in a Bill dealing with the whole question of benefits and pensions—particularly pensions—one does not expect to find such a want of consideration for the general run of our workpeople as we have here, when all that can be done is to put forward a Measure that will give the youngster of today, with an average income of, say, £12 a week, a pension of £3 10s. a week—after paying of course, this extra money for forty-seven years. According to the Government Actuary's Report, such a person will then receive £2 10s. a week, plus 20s.—while, again after paying this extra money for forty-seven years, the £15 a week man will get a total pension of £4 11s. a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On really begins to wonder whether this is a sincere attempt to bring in a satisfactory pensions scheme. What may be done in regard to industrial occupational schemes does not in any way add
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
to the Government's credit. What matters is the worthiness of the Government's scheme, and, when considering it, we have to see if there are not other and better methods of meeting the case without undue extravagance on the part of the Exchequer. I believe that the Government have given us a point of view not only worthy of the Conservative Party, but worthy of the serious consideration of the Liberal Party and the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This pay-as-you-go idea is new, and it is very healthy, but we have to ask why its benefits should be restricted to those earning from £9 to £15 a week and not extended to the great body of our people. In putting it forward, why should the Government restrict its benefits to less than half the working population? Are they being fair to those who want security? They are not being fair at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the idea is a good one, why cannot the rest of the community benefit from it? The reason is that the Government know perfectly well that the main principle in the Bill is one that, when applied, is far from satisfactory even to the section that is affected by it. I again ask why the Government should restrict any pension scheme to such a small section of the working community. It should be spread over the whole community,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This idea of the Government's is good, but they have fallen down very badly in restricting the application for the pensions scheme to the provision of improvements for the few, and in reality, of course, they are not improvements at all. People are being called upon to pay a tremendous amount of money for a small increase in pensions. As all my hon. Friend's have pointed out, the whole scheme is so bad in essence that it requires one section of the community to pay more than twice what it should be paying for the benefits, simply in order that the Government may raise money to help subsidise others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a better alternative? I believe that there is and that the scheme should be spread over the whole population and placed on a basis of 2 per cent. contributions with increasing benefits for different grades of the community. I have looked into the figures and I am convinced that a scheme could be drawn up on that basis which would mean a lower contribution and double the benefit envisaged in the Bill. I believe that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
Labour Party should also adopt that basis for its scheme and that in this respect the party has a great opportunity of improving the proposals it has put forward. The " pay-as-you-go " principle is good, but the Government have not attempted to deal with the problem in any satisfactory way. The contributions demanded and the benefits given are so unsatisfactory that if the people only knew the facts they would sweep the whole scheme into the sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. E. Oram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a point which I think has not been made so far in the Committee and to try to obtain a general picture of the extent to which the Bill will bring about a re-distribution of taxation burdens. My right hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Marquand) and others of my hon. Friends have made out on Second Reading, and particularly this morning, a devastatingly logical case to prove that the main purpose of the Bill is clearly to switch the financial burden from the upper ranges of income to the middle ranges. I have seen no sign of any refutation of that case. We shall look forward with interest to the attempt to refute it which we hope will be made later today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been trying to get a general picture of what the Bill means in terms of shifting the burden. The exact calculations are beyond me in my knowledge of these matters, but a rough picture can be obtained if one looks at the spread of the burden of existing Income Tax in relation to the three grades of income to which we so often refer. I have looked up the Report of the Inland Revenue issued early this year. We cannot, of course, obtain an exact comparison because the figures do not tie up with the £9 a week range and the £15 a week range, but I have worked it out that those with an income of £500 a year, which in rough terms is £9 a week, pay an 8 per cent. share of the income tax burden. The £9 to £15 a week people, whom I take from the tables as roughly those earning between £500 and £800 a year, pay 21 per cent. of the country's Income Tax payments. Those above the £15 a week range in these tables, whom I take roughly to be earning about £800 a year, pay 71 per cent. of the country's Income Tax. I emphasise that this is a system
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
of graded Income Tax which has been accepted by the House of Commons, which has been put before the House by a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, and which is generally recognised by most parties as socially just according to the principle that those most able shall bear the greatest burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there will be a considerable relief to the general taxpayer as a result of bringing the Bill into effect, it must mean that the relief will be in that same proportion to the share of Income Tax at present borne by those grades. It means that for every £100 of relief to the Exchequer brought about by the Bill those earning about £15 weekly will have the equivalent of £71 relief, the middle range will have relief of £21 and the lower range a relief of £8. That seems to me a remarkable redistribution of the tax burden. No Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer would dare put forward in a Finance Bill an operation of that kind, switching a direct tax burden from one group of Income Tax payers to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That very same financial operation is now being done in an entirely underhand and indirect way in the Bill. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, East said on Second Reading, this is not really a National Insurance Bill but a Finance Bill. It is a Bill which is doing something no Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer would dare to do openly, and it is doing it in an indirect and, I would say, dishonest way. It is our task to let the country know what is being done, so that What is being put forward as an improvement in pension arrangements will be seen as merely a piece of regressive financial manipulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (Mr. John Boyd-Carpenter)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should like to turn, first, to the first of the two speeches made by the right hon. Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Marquand), the one which he delivered at our last sitting. It was answered in substantial measure by my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary. The right hon. Gentleman therefore, will acquit me of discourtesy if I take that speech fairly briefly and devote rather more attention to the speech which he delivered this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first speech, as my hon. Friend pointed out to him, his original argument
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
that there were to be appreciable surpluses in the early years turns out to be founded on a misconception, since, taking the first decennium running to 1971, though there would be a surplus in some years, there would be on average a small deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leaves the specific question which the right hon. Gentleman asked about a fixed Exchequer contribution. It is intended that that shall remain operative even though the fund is in surplus. It is based upon a formula which has a minimum floor of £170 million built into it, and it is the intention that the contribution should go into the fund even though in later years the fund is in surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the future of the fund. It is certainly intended to maintain it. As he knows, there are at the moment in the two funds—because to be accurate there is both a national insurance fund and a national insurance reserve fund—about £1,500 million. It is the intention in the future, as in the past, to use the fund, though it is not a true fund in the sense of what would be required for a funded scheme. As the Committee knows, for that purpose it is very much too small—perhaps about 10 per cent. of what it should be—but it is intended to use it to even out particular, sudden and temporary calls on expenditure—such as, for example, the call made last year during the influenza epidemic, when the cost of sickness benefit rose appreciably—or to even out patches when the finances are less good because of unemployment. That, has been the concept of the fund since the beginning and there is no idea of changing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marquand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the fund is of this magnitude and intended for this purpose, why was it necessary to have Supplementary Estimates to meet the recent increase in unemployment benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was because on this occasion it was thought, on balance, right to finance the deficit under the powers of the 1954 Act. As the right hon. Gentleman appreciates—I will come later to the subsection which deals with the 1954 Act—these powers are permissive, and in our judgment it was right to exercise them. I should have thought, from the tenor of his own speech, that the right hon. Gentleman would have approved of that. The fund is there,
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
and it remains for the purpose I have stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the larger issue, the right hon. Gentleman, and his hon. Friends the Members for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds) and Wallsend (Mr. McKay), pointed out quite rightly that the Bill and this Clause in particular embody a conscious and deliberate move away from the concept of an actuarial scheme to an assessmentism or " pay-as-you-go " basis. It is a fact that even the present scheme in practice has already gone so far away from the actuarial concept as to make it perhaps difficult to recognise. The fact that people have come into benefit though their contribution records may be very short, the fact that four times during the lifetime of the scheme rates of benefit have increased, and the fact that, on the other side of the equation, some overload has been put on the contribution, all show that the actuarial concept was more a theory than a reality. I gather that we at any rate carry with us the hon. Member for Wallsend, who in both speeches in this debate, if I understood him aright, approved the general principle of a "pay-as-you-go" concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the question which the right hon. Gentleman raised in regard to the deficiency payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that since 1948 payments have been made into the reserve fund and no call has been made on it to meet any of the contingencies to which the right hon. Gentleman made reference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so, because the fund as a whole has been in surplus and there has been no need to draw on the reserve. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman with his experience would appreciate that there is no necessity to draw on reserves when you are in surplus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We discussed this on the 1957 Measure, when it was seen that the fund would go into deficit for the first time in the current financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming now to the deficiency payments dealt with in Clause 1 (3) (	<i>c</i>), the position is that Section 2 (3) of the National Insurance Act, 1954, made provision that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
up to a maximum of £325 million might be provided by the Exchequer over and above the fixed Exchequer contribution to meet deficiencies in the fund at any time up to 31st March, 1960. What the present subsection does is to extend that duration to 31st March, 1962.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that is this. The intention is that the Bill should operate from April, 1961; and, as the Committee knows from the published figures of the Government actuary, during the interval there will plainly be deficiencies on the present fund which it may be desired in whole or in part—I have already dealt with this point—to meet by the exercise of these powers. The proposal to carry them on until 31st March, 1962, is due to the fact that in the first year of the new scheme, owing to the new methods of collection, which we shall come to later on, there will be a once and for all short-fall of income. Therefore, the first year of the new scheme is covered by extending this provision to 31st March, 1962.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now deal, in passing, with a small though friendly argument which I had with the hon. Member for Ince (Mr. T. Brown) at an earlier stage. With respect to the position of agricultural workers under the scheme, he quoted figures which appeared to be at variance with those that I gave. The reason is that the figures given by the hon. Gentleman are older than my figures and relate to the year from April, 1957, to March, 1958. For some months of that year the basic minimum rate, as opposed to the earnings of agricultural workers was only 141s. a week and for the last five months it was 150s.—the average being therefore, about 145s.—whereas on the latest figures, which are those I gave, the basic is 156s. a week. It is clear, therefore, that both the hon. Gentleman and I are right, but my figures are later, and I suggest that when we are talking about March, 1961, they are nearer to relevance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon. Gentleman not seen since we had our debate that the figures that I gave have been proved to be correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are correct as of their date, but since then the basic rate of agricultural wages has been increased. The hon. Gentleman was right at the time, but I am right now. That is the distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
We now come to the Exchequer contribution itself. I have already dealt quickly with that, but for the sake of completeness, I will deal with it again. What is proposed is that the existing Exchequer contribution, which, as I think one hon. Member rightly stated, works out at about £125 million, shall now be raised under a new formula to one-quarter of the basic minimum in respect of employed people, plus one-third as at present in respect of the self-employed and non-employed, or £170 million, whichever is the larger. As the Government actuary's Report indicates, it seems that we shall be on the £170 million figure until about 1970 or 1971, after which, on the assumptions made, the formula will give a bigger figure than £170 million and we shall go on to that. The figure related to the basic minimum compares interestingly with the past. Under the 1946 Act the figure was on the average-the proportion was different for different benefits-about a quarter. Under the 1951 Bill as introduced by right hon. Gentlemen opposite the figure would have fallen to 6d. a head, but as a result of a good deal of discussion in which Lord Ingleby, as he now is, took part, it was raised to the level of one-sixth; and under the 1954 Act it remained at one-sixth for the employed and became one-third for the self-employed and non-employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the one-quarter Exchequer contribution, would the Minister have any objection to using the same figure to cover the whole of the people on a percentage basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather the hon. Gentleman's point, which is a serious one. I know he suggests that it should cover also the graduated contribution. In our view—and I will come in a moment to the argument of the hon. Member for Islington, North—that would be a wrong use of it in this scheme, the Committee having already decided on previous Amendments that the graduated portion should begin only in respect of earnings above £9 a week. We think the right thing is to relate the contribution of the Exchequer to that contribution which provides the basic pension and that, where one is dealing with earnings above that, and consequently with pensions above the basic, there is no case for putting in the Exchequer contribution. There is a real
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
difference between us, but I thought it right to draw attention to the fact that the figure of one-quarter is really coming back to 1946 so far as the minimum figure is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument is that the Exchequer contribution should be related to the flat-rate portion and not to the graduated portion, because we should not in any way pay out of the Exchequer for a graded addition to a flat-rate pension. Is that right? If that were true, I would agree. But surely the Exchequer contribution even now will be nothing like sufficient to pay even a half of the present flat-rate obligations of the Government. Therefore, I do not follow how the right hon. Gentleman's argument applies. He said that it should not be related to the graduated portion. The implication is that it should not be for graded pensions. It will not be for the graded pension. It will only be for the flat-rate one. even if one raised it to a proportion relating to the graduated one, the amount received would be far below what was required to pay for the flate-rate pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Gentleman is right. The proposal is that we increase from the present £125 million to at least £170 million the fixed Exchequer contribution. The question then arises as to how one calculates it. It is paid generally into the fund. That is the mechanics of it. Our calculation is that it is right to revert to the original one-quarter—that will give us at the moment only about £150 million, and temporarily the £170 million is fixed above that—but to provide for what we think is its true relationship to national insurance, namely, to relate it to the basic provision of a flat-rate pension. I think the position is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think one more question may get it clear. The right hon Gentleman says that he wants to relate the amount the Exchequer pays solely to the paying for the flat-rate benefit. I agree that we must use the Exchequer contribution only to pay for the flat-rate benefit. But if that is so, how can one do that and still relate the amount the Exchequer pays to the graded contribution as well? Even then one will only be paying for the flat-rate benefit. The Exchequer contribution nothing like pays
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
for the flat-rate benefit, and even if it were made 3 or 4 per cent. it still would not pay for flat-rate pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it does not totally pay for the flat-rate benefit. If it did, it would undermine the whole concept of the flat rate as an insurance provision. The whole concept of national insurance is, and has been for many years, that there should be three parties involved, namely, employer, employee and taxpayer. The hon. Gentleman is disputing this on a point that has no great substance, because the practical point here is that, as part of the insurance concept, the Exchequer payment ought, in our view, to be related to the contribution; and the proper contribution, I suggest to the Committee, to which it should relate is the flate-rate one which gives the entitlement to the flat-rate benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the right hon. Gentleman would answer this question. If it is wrong, as I understand him to say it is, for the Exchequer contribution to be related to the graded contribution, why is it not also wrong for the graded contribution to be used to subsidise the flat-rate contribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot, I think, have followed my argument, which concerns relating the Exchequer contribution to what seemed to us to be the relevant contribution of the contributors. Our view is that the supplementation from the taxpayer should be related to the basic contribution for basic benefits. That has nothing whatever to do with the further point as to the way in which the income from contributions of all sorts is allotted to benefit. That is an arguable but, I think the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, separate point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Middlesbrough, East said at some length this morning. He seemed to object rather strongly to the fact that the Clause and this Bill, as the Government actuary's table shows, put the national insurance fund on a sound financial basis, running almost in balance for the first twenty years or so and then coming into surplus. He sought to argue that in 1946 the concept had been that the liability incurred largely as the result of accepting for full benefit people with short contribution
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
records had been accepted as an indefinite deficiency to be met by the taxpayer. That may have been in some people's minds. He will realise that there is one factor that points against it, and that is the provision in Section 2 (4) of the original Act providing deliberately for a small increase—I think 4d.—in the rates of contribution to meet in some measure the increasing costs of the scheme. I really cannot accept that that was the view in 1946, or if it were, that it is binding on us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman cannot get away from the fact that, Whatever may have been the view in 1946, the rate of benefit has been increased on four occasions since; if I may allot responsibility, that has been done three times by my right hon. Friends and myself and once toy right hon. Members opposite. Quite plainly if the right hon. Gentleman was right about 1946—and I do not think he was—the situation must have been changed when everybody, whether on pension or not, or however near to retirement, benefited in this way, as everybody did on the last three occasions, and a good many did on the first occasion, from these increases in benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Craddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman say how much of those increases was provided by the Exchequer and how much by the contributors to the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the breakdown. There is, of course, an automatic relationship at the moment between the Exchequer contribution and the contribution of contributors. I cannot immediately give him the figures on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reynolds</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can help the right hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the right hon. Gentleman can but it is quite unnecessary because, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, under the existing scheme the Exchequer contribution is specifically related to the contributions of other contributors and, therefore, the proportion is fixed. Coming back to the main issue, I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman objects to our seeking to deal with the deficit in the way we do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marquand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, the right hon. Gentleman spent some time saying that this should be met by the taxpayer and that deficiencies should not be met by increasing the contribution. If that is not now his view, I will not waste time upon it. I was about to add—perhaps he anticipated me—that I thought this was one point on which there was no division between the two sides of the Committee, because tooth our proposals in the Bill and those for which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) is responsible seek to deal with the deficit. The only difference is that hon. Members opposite propose to deal much more drastically with it because they propose substantial surpluses in addition. I thought, therefore, that we should not waste time on a view widely held outside that it would be really thoroughly discreditable to leave this emerging deficit to rise year after year—as the hon. Gentleman seemed to think was suggested in 1946—and in so doing not only to impose increasing burdens on the taxpayer tout also to undermine the whole insurance concept of the payment of benefit as a right, and so on. I am relieved, therefore; but the right hon. Gentleman must admit that he spent some time upon that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to what was said by the right hon. Gentleman as to the method of dealing with the deficit. In his speech he implied that the whole of the burden was falling on those with incomes between £9 and £15 a week. I am sure he and the Committee appreciate that, although the graduated contributions fall between these limits, the contributions are, in fact paid by those with high incomes on that " slice " of their earnings which lies between £9 and £15 a week. It is not, therefore, quite fair to suggest, as was perhaps inadvertently done, that the whole burden is being placed upon those whose total earnings do not exceed £15 a week. It is only a matter of judgment, but we have already discussed on other Amendments whether or not the precise limit of £15 is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the point made by the hon. Member for Islington, North, who made an extremely interesting speech. As he very fairly said his actuarial calculation related to the entrant at sixteen. As he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
will appreciate better than anybody the actual contribution for the pension rises with each year in the age of entry and though it may well be that the hon. Gentleman's figure is right in respect of the entrant at sixteen, the point is increasingly irrelevant when we consider people of higher ages, and it is the fact that when the new scheme comes into operation it will take account of all people between the ages of eighteen and sixty-five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second flaw in the reasoning of the hon. Gentleman is that his assumption was also based on the idea that the entrant aged sixteen years would retire in forty-nine years' time receiving only the pension benefit current when he had entered the scheme at the age of sixteen. I do not think that is a real concept. The present insurance scheme has, as I have said, seen four increases in the last ten years and it is inconceivable that a new entrant today is likely to draw early in the new century a pension on the present basis. We have to calculate on the basis that the pension he will draw at the end of the day will not be that to which he began to contribute at the beginning of his working life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the hon. Gentleman asked, very properly, what was our concept if the basic rates of benefit were to be increased. I briefly mentioned our views on this on one of the earlier Amendments, but I shall be happy to recapitulate them. What steps are taken must depend on the judgment of the Government of the day and, to some extent at any rate, on the purpose of the increase. The increase may have one of two purposes, or a mixture of both—either to establish a real increase in standards of life or to compete with a rise in prices or to deal with a mixture of the two. Technically, additional revenue could be obtained, as the hon. Gentleman perfectly fairly said, without damage to the main structure of the scheme, by increasing the flat-rate contributions or by raising the " ceiling " for graduated contributions, or by increasing the percentage. All those are perfectly feasible methods of achieving what is wanted without damage or detriment to the main structure of the scheme. I am certainly not going to seek to foresee which method, or combination of methods, might make sense in the particular circumstances in which that decision may be taken, for that
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
must be for the Government of the day. My sole duty, as I believe the Committee will agree, is to make clear that these methods are possible within the framework of what the hon. Gentleman has properly described as a machinery Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reynolds</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has referred to calculations which I had made. He has admitted that they were correct as far as the £9 per week man of sixteen who would be getting the same benefit, but, in addition, he said it would be unfair to assume that that man would be getting the same benefit in forty-nine years' time. If it is good enough for the Government Actuary to assume that the benefit will be the same in forty-nine years' time, I really feel that the right hon. Gentleman must accept the view of the Government Actuary in his Report which assumes exactly that; and I do not feel that the Minister can criticise me or can say I am wrong in taking an assumption made by the Government Actuary. I agree with his point that people do not only come in at sixteen but come in when they are older and get the benefit; but people coming in with earnings of £1,000 a year in 1948 who retire in three years' time get the same subsidy towards pensions as those who came in at £9 a week in 1948 and retire in three years' time. His view, however, is that the £170 million will subsidise the lower-paid worker but they will all get the same irrespective of whether the period is seven years or twenty years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely these defects of the present scheme that we are seeking by this Measure to cure. I gather from the hon. Gentleman that he has some sympathy with this. Of course, the Government Actuary can proceed only on the figures for present benefits. What the hon. Gentleman has said illustrates the fallacy of basing any assessment of a State scheme on actuarial calculations of this kind. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well, as does every Member of this Committee, that when we are talking of forty-nine years hence, it is, in the light of history over the last ten years, completely unrealistic to base a view on the assumption that the pension will still be exactly the same at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is really the difference between a State scheme based on a pay-as-you-go system and not funded, and the very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
proper actuarial calculations made in respect of a funded private scheme. While the hon. Gentleman's calculation is interesting, therefore, it is plainly unrealistic as a basis on which Members of the Committee should make up their minds on the validity of these proposals. Though it is interesting, it is not something upon which this Committee will wish to base its decision, for that decision must be based on broad lines and be related to the real characteristics of a Government scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman on this except on one basic matter. He says we cannot, when considering the merits of future State pensions, base our thoughts on any actuarial calculations. What is an employer to do, therefore, when considering the merits of contracting out? We all say that benefits must be comparable, but if that is to be so there must be comparable actuarial calculations. I am not clear how the Minister combines what he now says with the practicability of contracting out. If he is right in that no one can calculate the future of State schemes, how is an employer to decide, and how are we to decide, whether an employer's private scheme has benefits at least as good as the State scheme? We must have a firm basis. My hon. Friend was taking a figure on the view that when the State says it will pay so much it will do so; otherwise we cannot have contracting out of private schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must not anticipate discussion on Clause 7 and subsequent Clauses of the Bill, and that is precisely the type of matter which the Committee will wish to discuss at that stage. I do not feel I am being discourteous to the hon. Gentleman if I reserve my observations on that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just giving the right hon. Gentleman fair warning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always obliged to the hon. Gentleman for even the smallest mercies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Ham, North (Mr. Prentice) put forward an argument turning on the separate treatment of the flat-rate and graded pension. I have wearied the Committee, and I do not wish to weary it much longer, with my contention that it is wrong to look
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
at these two matters separately and that when considering their adequacy or otherwise it is the flat rate plus the graded together which furnishes the real basis for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the assumptions on which the Government Actuary worked, unemployment was assumed at 3 per cent. I feel that that was not a rash assumption. The only occasion since the war on which unemployment has been above that figure—I hope I shall not introduce an un-harmonious note in mentioning this-was in the spring of 1947; so it seems to me a fairly reasonable assumption. The hon. Gentleman went on to criticise the assumption that the level of earnings would be increasing at 2 per cent., without assuming any rise in benefits; this is the very point that I have been discussing. He then took the third assumption of 2½ million contracting out. As he and the Committee will appreciate, in putting forward that figure we gave very careful thought to the matter and, in particular, to the very full and authoritative report of the Government Actuary on private schemes. If the hon. Gentleman has studied that Report, as I am sure he has, he will have seen that, although private schemes now cover some 6½ million people, many of those schemes give quite small cover or indeed only flat-rate benefits. Clearly, they would not qualify for contracting out even if those operating them desired to apply to do so. Similarly, there are some schemes which might comply 	<i>prima facie</i> with most of the criteria for contracting out, but where those responsible for them have indicated in public that, on principle, they do not favour contracting out. All those factors were taken into account in leading us to consider that this is a reasonable figure for the assumption on contracting out; and I believe it will not be very far from the mark.

The real question now before the Committee has, I suppose, in some measure been decided on the Amendments to the Clause. If we accept—as I think the intervention of the right hon. Member for Middlesbrough, East entitles us to accept—that it is not disputed that we ought to put the finances of the scheme in balance, and if it is accepted—as the Committee has accepted—that the maximum for contributions should be the

	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
ceiling of £15 a week, then we come inevitably to a scheme broadly on these lines. In considering the benefits it confers it is not right to take only the new part of the scheme; it is essential to a proper judgment of it—which I am sure is what hon. Members want to give—to take account of both the flat-rate and the graduated benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A paragraph of the White Paper—I believe it is paragraph 11—indicates how very beneficial a bargain it is for a man retiring today. That will be the case, taking the flat rate alone, for many years to come and when the graduated benefit is taken on top of that, it will remain so. To form a clear judgment of the finances of the scheme, it is essential to have in mind the limitations of any State scheme based on assessmentism. This scheme fulfils the purposes of the balancing of the finances of the fund, of initiating a system of graduated benefits and contributions for those not in an occupational scheme and, although deliberately and consciously moderate in scale, of providing a firm foundation for social advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee will be very grateful to the Minister for the attempt he has just made to answer so many penetrating questions put to him in the course of the debate this morning. It is not our fault that all the questions have come from one side of the Committee. We would have wished that hon. Members opposite would have been able to play a bigger part in our discussions on this Clause. I have rarely heard better informed and more penetrating speeches on these complicated subjects than those which have come from my right hon. and hon. Friends this morning. I am not surprised that the Minister has evaded so many of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in difficulty in getting the real truth about the financial mysteries of this Scheme. The Minister of Health wound up the debate on the White Paper. On the Second Reading of the Bill, the Minister of Labour wound up the debate. In neither case were they in a position, with great respect to both of them, to come to grips with the financial criticisms of the scheme made by my hon. and right hon. Friends. We hoped that this morning we would really get down to the core. I am not sure I am equal to the task of
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
sorting out the complex pattern of discussion and criticism of the scheme and reducing it to simple terms, but I shall do my best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This scheme starts with the desire to get rid of prospective deficiencies of the old scheme. Nothing else really entered into the consideration at the outset but that. There was no motive in the initial approach to this matter of providing better benefits for the better paid. That, if it came, was to be incidental to the main financial operation of spiriting away the prospective deficiencies in the existing scheme. I think we are entitled to examine where the deficiencies have gone. The deficiencies have gone under the financial provisions of the scheme and, what is more, eventually a surplus takes the place of prospective increasing deficiencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We begin by asking how has that been done. How have the Minister and his Joint Parliamentary Secretaries, the Mas-kelynes and Devants of this operation, managed to do something where the quickness of the hand deceives the eye? The Minister certainly has done something miraculous. There is a magic which he has brought to bear upon us. Now we want to know what that magic is. We look in the White Paper for one or two clues. Paragraph 34 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Embodied in the graduated scale there would need to be a minimum contribution. This would have to be high enough to form a solid contribution towards the financing of the standard rates of benefit, the provision of which the Government continue to regard as the prime purpose of the National Insurance scheme, and which they will, of course, keep under review."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The principle of graduation would, however, permit this minimum contribution to be materially lower than the existing flat-rate. The lower wage-earner would thus be relieved of some of the burden he has to carry at present."</p></blockquote>
That shows not only that the deficiency has gone, not only that it has been converted eventually into a surplus, but that the existing flat-rate contribution has been reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The magic grows more amazing as one goes on. How has that been done? We look at the last three lines of paragraph 35, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The introduction of contributions graduated according to earnings would make it possible to concentrate the Exchequer contribution where it is most needed."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
Now I think we are getting a little closer to it. I assume there is no contradiction to the assertion that the Exchequer contribution proposed in Clause 1 (3) is wholly concentrated on flat-rate benefits. That, I think, we all now understand. Can we get even a little closer to where the Exchequer contribution is to go? Do the calculations include any Exchequer contribution towards the flat-rate benefit of people who will be in the graduated scheme? We ought to know that. In other words, are those in the graduated scheme at least to pay for the whole of that flat-rate benefit as well as their graduated benefits without an Exchequer contribution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important question, but there is another one. Do the calculations include any Exchequer contribution in the case of flat-rate benefits for non-participating employments? That is important too. The answer is surely suggested by the fact that the flat-rate contributions for those in non-participating employments are to remain at their pesent level and not to be reduced, and, moreover, that the increases in the flat-rate contributions are to be higher for the non-participating employments than for the others-a difference between 9d. a week for the non-participating employments to the flat-rate contribution and 5d. for those in the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am trying to get the Minister to do is to produce his deferred annuity tables. It is only if we get down to the examination of the contributions of individuals, employers and the Exchequer in relation to benefits that we can really see whether this scheme is value for money. The Minister indicated a few moments ago his disinclination to do any such thing. We have been talking this morning in millions, global amounts of enormous dimensions, but the individual contributor looking at a proposed scheme for deferred annuity is not concerned with the millions that the insurance company may talk to him about in regard to reserves, interest, mortality tables, morbidity tables and the rest. He wants to know, a What shall I get for what I pay in?" When we come to Clause 4, which deals with benefits, we can examine more closely what the contributors are to get for their money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we on this side of the Committee see it. the scheme boils down to this, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
those with over £9 a week who will be within the scheme of graduated contributions are not only going to eliminate the need for an Exchequer contribution in relation to their own flat-rate benefits, but are also to make a contribution to the flat-rate benefits of those not in the graduated scheme. It also follows that the return such a person will get for his graduated contributions in terms of graduated benefits will fall short of what would be a reasonable return on those contributions. I think it axiomatic that that must be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister in looking at his problem asked himself, " How shall I meet this prospective deficiency? Will the general taxpayer stand it? Shall I increase the Exchequer contribution to do it? Shall I increase contributions to do it? " All those possibilities have gone through his mind. He makes great play with the fact that the Exchequer contribution is to be somewhat increased, from £125 million to £170 million, and he makes a virtue of that, but, of course, the prospective deficiency-which, unless provided for in some other way, the taxpayer would have to have borne-was very much greater than that. I should say he has not increased the Exchequer contribution sufficiently having regard to the prospective burden on the taxpayer which the deficiencies would otherwise have imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman came to the conclusion that he could not increase the flat-rate contribution. What I cannot understand is why he conceived it necessary to reduce flat-rate contributions. Those flat-rate contributions have been accepted by all concerned over recent months. I see no reason why he should have reduced flat-rate contributions if by so doing he was going to throw an unjust burden upon only moderately paid workers who would come into the graduated scheme. He may also have considered whether he could have graduated contributions for flat-rate benefits, but he may have heard rumours to the effect that some years ago the Trades Union Congress set its face firmly against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister therefore turned to this hybrid scheme of merging the flat-rate scheme with a graduated scheme with the finances so involved and mysterious that no one would really know what was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
happening to his money and whether he was getting value for his contributions. The right hon. Gentleman still has to satisfy the contributors under the graduated scheme that they are not being used unjustly as an agency for financing the deficiencies of the existing scheme. Nothing that the Minister has so far said can remove that conviction from the mind of anyone who studies this scheme closely.

It is no excuse to say that this is a " pay-as-you-go " scheme, and that everything goes into the pool. Of course everything goes into the pool. Everything goes into the pool in a vocational scheme, a group insurance scheme or any individual insurance with an insurance company. That is not the important point. The important point is what comes out of the pool in benefits in return for the contributions paid. That is what matters, and the Minister has not brought us down to the detail of that——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister would have been out of order, had he dealt with benefits, which are dealt with in Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may modestly say so, however, I think that I have at least led up to the climax that it is the critical examination of the relationship between contributions and benefits that the Minister has still to give us. It may out of order for him to do so on this Clause, but I assure him that we will return to this subject later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow up the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton). I must congratulate the Minister on one thing, at least. I appreciate his difficulties. I appreciate that each time he replies his major objective is to avoid answering our specific questions without seeming to say nothing at all. He does it with conspicuous success. It all sounds very nice, but on reading his words the next day one finds that every single, precise point put to him has been avoided with his usual elegance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
It is the job of a Standing Committee to investigate precise, detailed points. We do not want to have Second Reading speeches here. We are concerned with the details of the Bill. Strangely enough, from the limited number of speakers from the other side we get nothing but Second Reading speeches. The precision is all on this side. Reports of this morning's discussion will show that speech after speech from this side has dealt in great detail with the Bill, while there has been vacuity in the speeches of hon. Members opposite. However, I hope that if we press on with these precise questions, the Minister will sooner or later come out with at least one or two precise answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that subsection (3) contains the real purpose of the Bill. It is a purpose on which the right hon. Gentleman has been congratulated by the 	<i>Economist</i>—that of saving the Exchequer hundreds of millions of pounds over the next twenty or thirty years by way of what is called Exchequer liability. None of us disputes that over the next twenty years or so there will be a swelling liability to pay for obligations undertaken many years ago. It is true that they were obligations undertaken by right hon. and hon. Friends of mine, but they were undertaken without protest from the party opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of those obligations was that which came into force last year of paying the extra pensions—to make them comprehensive—to all those who qualified in the previous ten years. That was a huge new obligation, and it was, if I may say so, a bipartisan obligation, and one that has to be honoured. The only issue in this Committee is the precise method of honouring an obligation assumed in the first great post-war National Insurance Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right, the Minister's method of honouring that obligation is to do it by a curious semantic device, by saying that the national insurance fund is in the red and will always stay in the red if the Exchequer contribution is larger than he likes. There are 150 different ways of meeting the obligation, as between the employer, the employee and the Exchequer. A total sum has to be paid, and it can be paid by any proportion of contribution from the three sides. For a long time this problem was very much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
aggravated by the existence of the flat-rate contribution, which the Minister will agree was an unfair poll tax because it meant that the lowest-paid person was the heaviest hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that one way of meeting that problem was to move from flat-rate to graded contribution. I have never disguised, nor have any of my right hon. or hon. Friend's, the fact that in any reformed pensions scheme part of the contribution will go towards financing past obligations—unless one were to remove to the taxpayer the total obligation for the lowest-paid workers' contributions. I do not think that any politician has ever seriously put forward the idea that one should transfer the whole of the obligation to the taxpayer, for the simple reason that, as the Minister said, it would undermine the whole insurance principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There still remains the problem of the proportion as the liability grows, as it will grow over the next twenty years. We on this side and, I thought, all Governments up to now, assumed that as the liability grew the contribution made by each of the three sides would swell. It is obvious common justice that if a certain relationship between the three sides was fixed in 1946 for a small sum, then, as the sum of the liability grows, each side should proportionately increase its contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, I thought it had been appreciated that a very heavy burden would in the future fall on the Exchequer. That would not make the contribution exactly proportionate but, by and large, the Exchequer liability was bound to grow because, with a poll tax, as it was before, the contribution could not be increased without putting an intolerable burden on the worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The puzzle is why, with a current growing liability, the purpose of the Bill is to fix the Exchequer contribution at £175 million a year, or something just a little over that figure. One fascinating thing is the way in which the Minister has decided to hitch the Exchequer contribution to the flat rate. If we are dealing with a growing liability and a growing national income, it is just that the Exchequer contribution should grow at least proportionately with the national income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
That is why we say that that contribution should be roughly 2 per cent. of the average national earnings. In that way, one ensures that the Exchequer always pays each year proportionately to the increased revenue. It puts no new burden on the Exchequer, because as its income is increased it can afford to pay its part of the increased liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not clear, therefore, why the Minister has not accepted this very simple principle of drawing from the Exchequer, not a fixed sum in relation to the flat—rate contribution but a contribution related to the national income-not as so many pounds, shillings and pence but as the Exchequer's slice of the burden, so that the better off we are the larger the Exchequer's proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is right that as the graded contributor's wages, and the national income, increase, so should his contribution increase, why should not the Exchequer also have an automatic increase made in its contribution? Once we have laid down graded contributions, to ensure that the Exchequer contribution must also be related to the swelling size of the national income——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Spencer Summers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does not the hon. Member realise that one of the complaints that he and other hon. Members have voiced, that this graduated principle will gradually extinguish itself by coming up against the ceiling, completely upsets his present argument that graduated contributions Should automatically entail graded increases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the major objections to the Government scheme as compared with ours. It is not related to the problem that I am raising, which is why the Minister, faced with a growing liability and a growing national income, does not lay it down that the Exchequer contribution should grow as well, and at a rate faster than the present one, which is related to the flat rate. That is my first question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to my second question. I am not an economist. I have not been given the economic training that so many hon. Members have had. Therefore, I like to read simple pamphlets such as the Conservative Party produces. From the Conservative pamphlet on pensions I really understood about this scheme. Its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
explanation is so much clearer than the Minister's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to go through this series of questions and answers with the right hon. Gentleman just to make sure that it has not been repudiated by him. The pamphlet has absolute clarity. Speaking as a pamphleteer myself, I know that clarity can sometimes defeat its own end, and the authors of this pamphlet have been too clear in explaining the Government's purpose. Starting in page 10, there are five questions and five admirable answers. Here is question No. 15:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is true that the National Insurance Fund is getting into the red? If so, why is this?"</p></blockquote>
We are given an admirable answer:
	<br><blockquote><p>These deficits arise because when the present National Insurance pension started in 1946, full pension rights were given to many people whose contributions would not anything like cover the cost of their pension."</p></blockquote>
The conclusion to which the authors come is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The cost of pensions was, therefore, bound eventually to outstrip the income from contributions."</p></blockquote>
Question 16 asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why cannot the deficits in the Fund be met out of taxation?"</p></blockquote>
That is a question to which we all want an answer, but the answer in the pamphlet is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government believe it would not be right for the burden of these deficits to be piled on to the taxpayers. This would amount to drawing a blank cheque on the future."</p></blockquote>
We are in great suspense. We are all contributors. We do not want blank cheques drawn on us, so we turn to Question 17 with keen interest:
	<br><blockquote><p>"How will the scheme put pensions on a sound financial footing?"</p></blockquote>
Here, in the answer, is no nonsense such as we had from the Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>"First, by introducing a graduated system under which contributions rise as earnings rise "—</p></blockquote>
that is, first, by making this group of people pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will not be enough "—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
candour, again:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to get the fund out of the red so there will be a small increase in contributions at intervals laid down over the first 20 years …"</p></blockquote>
Contributions are the sole method of getting us out of the red. I will not read the next part of the answer, which is all about contributions, but the Minister can refer to it if he thinks that I am unfair. The conclusion in the answer is:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Hence by the end of 20 years the Fund will be showing a modest yearly surplus, whereas if no action were taken the present scheme would be in deficit to the tune of some £400 million."</p></blockquote>
That is to say, this increase of contributions will bring in the extra £400 million necessary to remove a deficit from the Exchequer and turn it into a surplus. I congratulate the young men who wrote that, for their clarity if not for their discretion, because we come now to Question 18, and the answer to it, which is almost the most embarrassing of all. Question 18 asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why cannot contributions be raised straight away to the level necessary to carry the future cost of pensions?"</p></blockquote>
Here is the answer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Government believe it would be wrong to compel the contributor to pay more than is necessary to meet the present cost. The money not immediately required should be left in the pockets of the contributors ".</p></blockquote>
How very gracious of them to say that when one is forcing the contributors, by changing the method of contribution, to pay practically all the liability previously shared with the Exchequer, one is to be kind enough not to raise their contributions more than will enable one to pay each stage of the increasing liability as it comes. All that this scheme is designed to do over the next 20 years is to see that as the liability for pensions grows the contributions grow in order to cover the liability——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
