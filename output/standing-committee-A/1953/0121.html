<p>Amendment proposed—[<i>20th January</i>]—in page 3, line 7, at the end, to add:
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Compensation payments referred to in this section shall
<ol>
<li>be made and calculated on the basis that each of the persons referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be paid a uniform percentage of the amount paid to such person in wages or salary during the year preceding the relevant event of loss of employment or otherwise referred to in the said subsection whether such event is due to a contraction of the Commission's activities after the first day of January, nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and before the passing of this Act or after the passing of this Act and before an order is made under subsection (1) of section four of this Act or is due to the dissolution of the Commission under an order made under the last-mentioned section of this Act and</li>
<li>shall include the repayment to all such persons if they so require of all contributions made by them or on their behalf to the superannuation scheme operated by the Commission with interest at four-and-a-half per cent.—(<i>Mrs. Braddock.</i>]</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p>Question again proposed, "That those words be there added."</p>
<p>10.33 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sydney Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday I intervened in the speech of the right hon. Gentleman—I am sorry he is not hereto say that even up to that moment I had not received a copy of the proposed compensation scheme. I have now received it, and it is fair to say that it was probably in my post bag when I intervened yesterday. I dare say it had been posted with the others the night before.<br><br>
It was accompanied by an undated slip. I think I know why the slip was undated, because, in substance, what it said was that the document which we now have was being circulated in accordance with a promise which the President had given on 17th December, and to have put the date of yesterday or the day before on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
that slip would only have made the delay all the more conspicuous.<br><br>
Without wishing to accuse anyone of intentional discourtesy, when notice is taken in the Committee of such a document dated as long ago as 17th December, and when the Minister on that date undertakes that he will circulate a copy of the document, it is treating the Committee in a somewhat cavalier fashion if the document is not circulated for a month after that, and only just in time, if in time, to be in the hands of Members of the Committee on the very morning when we are discussing its terms.<br><br>
I know that the Minister yesterday had two excuses—perhaps I should say explanations. He said that it had been in the Library for some days before that. That is interesting. The right hon. Gentleman did not say how many Members of the Committee there are, how many copies there were in the Library, whether we had to form a queue to read it there, or in what way the Committee were to inform themselves on this document.<br><br>
Then the right hon. Gentleman said, "Never mind my undertaking to circulate it and the lateness with which I carried out that undertaking, for, even if hon. Members do not often go to the Library to find out what documents have recently been laid there by a Minister, they could have read it all in the 'Manchester Guardian.'" There are many of us here who have great respect for the "Manchester Guardian." Like another famous journal, it is not, perhaps, all that it used to be, but then, as another famous journal always retorted when that was said, perhaps it never was. I think they are entitled to have acknowledgment for their enterprise in getting hold of something before we got it and in printing it. It is useful for them to have done so, but it is no substitute for the duty of the Government to place hon. Members of the Committee, who have ultimately to decide this matter, in possession at an early date of the document which they are being asked to discuss and which ultimately they are being asked to endorse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but perhaps his argument may be advanced a little further if I make the point that most of the period since we last met was a period
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
of Recess when most hon. Members were out of London. I can inform him that, having visited the Library on many occasions, there were so many structural alterations going on, so many dust-sheets and other appurtenances of reconstruction, that it would have been impossible for any hon. Member to have gone to the place where these things were—if they were still there during the Recess—and to have read them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my right hon. Friend. Obviously I was aware that for most of the period from 17th December onwards the Library was practically inaccessible to hon. Members of the Committee for this purpose. I rather thought that the President of the Board of Trade said yesterday that the document had been lodged in the Library early in December. I do not know whether that is so or not, but, in any event, the main point is that placing the document in the Library, or making it available to a newspaper which prints it at some length in the course of its duty of public vigilance, is no proper substitute for the duty of the Government to place hon. Members in full possession in adequate time of any document which is necessary to them in order that they may form a judgment on the matters which they have to judge.<br><br>
It is not right, and it links up only too unfortunately with a previous discussion we had about the generally cavalier attitude which the Board of Trade adopts towards its administrative and legal duties. A serious argument was advanced in the Committee that many things were done without authority, and that this Bill is in large part an indemnity Bill to cover breaches of constitutional duty.<br><br>
To come to the proposal itself, the Minister yesterday advanced another argument. I do not know whether it was intended as a further justification for not enabling the Committee to have the proper documents in time. The right hon. Gentleman seemed to be saying that it did not really matter whether we formed an opinion or not, that all the people concerned had considered it, that they had come to an agreement about it, and that we ought to hesitate a long time before we interfered with it. When the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
Minister says "hesitate a long time," I think he means, do not do it at all.<br><br>
This Committee is not a rubber stamp for outside agreements. I agree that it would be a great mistake for Parliament, or any Committee of Parliament, in making up its mind about a matter, not to give due regard to any agreements or discussions that had proceeded outside and on which the proposal placed before Parliament was no doubt based. Of course we give proper and great weight to it. It does not mean that we have not got our duty to do. Whatever agreements may have been reached outside, it is for us to say whether the proposal placed before us is a right or a wrong one. If we come to the conclusion that it is a wholly wrong proposal, unacceptable in principle, we ought not to hesitate either a long time or a short time to say so, whatever agreements have been reached outside.<br><br>
The Minister was a little vague about those agreements which have been reached outside. We would like to know with whom the discussions were held, with what association or what branch of what association, in what circumstances, when and where; what proposals were put before the various people consulted, what alternative proposals were put: what amendments or modifications were suggested, and whether, in the result, the acceptance of these proposals was an enthusiastic acceptance of proposals which were generally popular or whether they were accepted as the best they could get in the circumstances.<br><br>
It is not enough to say to the Committee, "Never mind, this is all right, this is generous, and everybody we consulted outside is satisfied." Even if we are to give due weight to those facts—I have said more than once that we should—at least we must have the full, detailed facts of what the negotiations were about, when they were conducted, with whom they were conducted, and what precisely was the result achieved.<br><br>
About none of that did the Minister say a single word, and I find it extremely difficult to understand how any representative, at any rate of the weekly wage earners, could have accepted these proposals. Were they accepted by direct representatives of the weekly wage earners, or were the negotiations all tied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
up in the scheme as a whole so that the people who were negotiating on the workers' side consisted largely not of the weekly wage earners, but of the monthly wage earners?<br><br>
This is a much better proposal for those paid by the month than for those paid by the week. <i>pro rata,</i> a man gets four times as much if he is paid monthly as if he is paid weekly, and, normally, a wage or salary paid monthly is in itself a much higher salary than a wage normally paid weekly. We have that discrepancy to begin with. If we multiply that discrepancy by four, as my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) said yesterday, we get a fantastic result.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
On what possible basis can this discrimination be justified? I quite understand that people do not arrive at proposals without having some motive behind the proposals they advance. If they satisfy the recipients that it is right there must be some argument to justify it. I have been unable to discover it for myself and the President did not say a word about it yesterday. I regard the principle as wholly insupportable. The nearest guess I can make is that it is based on the notion that if a person is paid a weekly wage, a weekly contract has been made, and that if wages are paid by the month, a monthly contract has been made.<br><br>
In normal circumstances a weekly wage earner can always be got rid off by giving him a week's notice, and a monthly wage earner can always be got rid of by giving him a month's notice. The argument may have been that the weekly wage earner has only a quarter of the security of the monthly wage earner, and that, if we are compensating them both, the monthly wage earner has lost four times as much as the weekly wage earner and had four times the security. We are taking away the security, and therefore it is right in one case to base the compensation on the monthly wage and in the other on the weekly wage.<br><br>
But any such argument is completely defeated by the terms of the proposal itself. The compensation is being based on the fact that until this Measure comes into operation both have full security of employment. What does a man have to establish before he is entitled to any compensation at all? One has only to look
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
at paragraph (<i>a</i>) to see that the persons eligible will be those who satisfy two conditions set out in the document. The first condition is that the man was
<br><blockquote><p>"in the Commission's service on 3rd July, 1952, and ceased to be employed by the Commission as a direct result of the Government's action in changing the arrangements for the importation of cotton."</p></blockquote>
Whether he is a weekly wage earner or a monthly salary earner he does not begin to come into the picture until he establishes that he was in the service of the Commission on 3rd July, 1952, and that he is leaving his job as a result of this contemplated legislation. When he has done that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member quoting from this scheme which has been handed to me? I ought to tell the Committee that I have not yet received a copy of the paper which we are now discussing. Quite clearly a mistake has been made, and it is difficult to follow the debate. I think that whoever is responsible ought to see that I get a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Some of us regard it not only as an unfortunate error, but as disrespect to the Chair, because, if anybody should have been provided with a copy of this important document, one would have thought that person was the Chairman of this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no need to make this a question of disrespect to the Chair. It would be very hurtful to my pride if I thought pit a deliberate mark of disrespect to the Chair. I have disturbed the Committee by taking it into my confidence, but I wanted to register an opinion that I should have been sent a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member, no doubt, is trying to help me, and I am grateful to him. I will follow as best I can what the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) is saying if the Committee will now allow him to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I do not want to take up the point about disrespect, Mr. Thomas, because you have dealt with that, but there is an even more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
important point involved. Surely it is the tradition and practice of the House, and I presume that it applies to Standing Committees, that when any document is referred to, it should become public property so that all hon. Members may familiarise themselves with it. Yesterday it was said that some hon. Members had had copies and that others had not. Surely this is a direct breach of the long standing rule of Parliament. We are attempting to debate a Clause which is related to a document which one hon. Member of the Committee—I will not say the Chairman—has not had. I submit that that is a breach of the long standing order, and that we cannot continue the discussion until all hon. Members have seen the document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am concerned, I believe I can follow this document, and I rather regret that I took the Committee into my confidence, but I have done so and I trust that the Committee will respect my request and will now allow us to continue consideration of this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Greenwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although we appreciate your position, Mr. Thomas, and the fact that you may be able to follow the document, may I point out that it will be very difficult for other hon. Members who have not been taken into the confidence of the Government on this point to do so? May I ask the Minister whether he can give the Committee an assurance that every effort was made by his Department to make the document available to every hon. Member of the Standing Committee apart from yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. E. M. Braddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the comments I made yesterday, I specifically asked the President of the Board of Trade if he would include this document in the proceedings of this Committee. Had it been printed as part of the proceedings of yesterday's Sitting the Chairman would have had the opportunity of seeing it, because it would be recorded. I again ask that as this document definitely concerns the Committee it should be included in the OFFICIAL REPORT of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady read a great deal of this document yesterday. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
think that we might now get on with the question which the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne is pursuing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Board of Trade (Mr. Heathcoat Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to express my deep regret that a copy of the document was not in your hands, Mr. Thomas, before our Sitting yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Braddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press my point that the document should be published.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say to the Minister and to the Committee that I realise that it would have been much wiser if I had asked privately for this document—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—but I did not. I trust that the Committee will now allow the hon. Member to continue his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greenwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I hate to say this, but I am afraid that the Minister rather side-stepped the point which I put to him. I wanted him to tell us what steps had been taken to see that a copy was provided for all hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the Minister will be replying to the debate later on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that no hon. Member of the Committee on either side will be other than grateful to you, Mr. Thomas, for having raised this point. It would have been wrong to continue without knowledge of the fact. I say that for this reason. By the long-established custom of Parliament, whether in the House or in Committee, we do not address one another; we address the Chair. All our arguments and all our speeches are addressed to the Chair, and it makes a farce of such a convention if the argument we are addressing is not in the least understood by the Chair because the occupant of the Chair has not been provided with the document on which the argument is proceeding.<br><br>
I am relieved to know that it is not necessary fur me to begin my speech all over again and to explain from the beginning, but I think that the Government and the President of the Board of Trade ought to consider not only whether they are treating the Chair, but also the Committee and the House of Commons, with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
proper respect in this way. We ought to have had this document long ago and the Chairman ought to have had it first.<br><br>
The argument I was addressing to the Committee was on the possible justification for discriminating between those whose salaries were paid by the month and those whose money was received in the form of a weekly wage. The best guess I could make as to the possible reason for that discrimination is on the basis that a weekly wage earner is regarded as having less security to lose than is a monthly salary earner. I was seeking to point out that by the terms of the document itself such an argument could not apply to this compensation scheme because of what the beneficiary of the scheme has to establish before he becomes entitled to anything at all. The first thing he has to establish is that he was in the employment of the Commission on 3rd July, 1952, and that he is ceasing to be employed by the Commission or had ceased to be employed as a direct result of the legislation we are now considering. He has to do that before he comes into the picture at all.<br><br>
Having proved so much, he still has not proved enough because then he has to establish the second leg, as it were, that he had at least three years' continuous service at the date of termination of service or held a permanent established employment under a formal letter of appointment. What is the meaning of that? It is a way of defining who shall be regarded as a permanently employed person by the Commission—who has security of employment. It will be noticed that no distinction is made in this part of the document between the wage earner and the salary earner. They each have to prove the same things and when they have proved the same things they must be taken, I suppose, to have established their security of employment under the Commission under the legislation that we are now proceeding to repeal.<br><br>
If they have established by the same definition and on the same conditions an equal security of employment, on what ground is their compensation assessed so that one gets four times <i>pro rata</i> what the other gets? Is it on a class principle, the old Tory principle that they always look after the classes first and leave the masses to look after themselves? I am sure that there is no hon. Member of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
Committee who would not reject any such proposition.<br><br>
Then what is the proposition? The President said yesterday that they had to seek a fine balance between what was just, on the one hand, and not spending too much money on the other—at least so I understood his argument. He said that was the dilemma. After generations of Tory propaganda, it is perfectly clear that there is not a Conservative who would not be completely in favour of and enthusiastic about the most beneficial welfare State provided it cost nothing. Unfortunately it does cost something, and compensation schemes cost something.<br><br>
Are the Commission saying, "We have established this discrimination because there are far more weekly wage earners than there are people who get monthly salaries, and, therefore, if we want to save money the one way to do it is to give smaller compensation to the wage earner than to the other class of people"? I do not know whether that is the reason, but if the Government wanted to save money that would be a very effective way to do it. It is the easiest way to save a lot of money.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
I am quite sure that if an amendment were proposed to this scheme to give the weekly wage earners compensation on the same basis as others, the first thing the President would tell us would be, "Oh, but look at the cost?" Is that the reason? Was it to keep down the cost, and, if so, will the Minister of State tell us what the cost is likely to be, not in proportions but in figures? How much is the whole compensation scheme going to cost; how much of it is going to how many of the salary earners and how much of it is going to how many of the weekly wage earners? We have had far too little details of the scheme.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock) said yesterday:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should like the President to say during the discussion on the Amendment that he will be quite prepared to have the documents reproduced in the Minutes of the Committee's proceedings so that those outside who are taking an interest and those staffs which are redundant will be able to see the proposition that has been made by the Board of Trade with reference to compensation."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 20th January, 1954; c. 246.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
I ask the Minister of State to reply directly to that question from my hon. Friend.<br><br>
A document is now being circulated, or almost circulated, to every Member of the Committee, with, apparently, some insignificant exceptions. I suppose the omission will be rectified so far as this Committee is concerned, but how is Parliament to know what the proposals are? Is this document to be circulated to every Member of the House of Commons and of another place? If not, what method does the Minister propose to take to make sure that the House—after all, this is only a Committee—gets it. The House may not agree to what we have done. There are further stages of this Bill, including the Report stage and Third Reading, with ample opportunities, if the Chair permits, for further consideration, alteration and modification.<br><br>
Then there are the people who are outside the House of Commons. When it is said in the semi-privacy of this Committee that discussions have been had with all kinds of people and that everybody is happy except the Labour Party in the Committee, I think it ought to be stated in such a way that everyone outside who is affected will be able to relate that statement to the actual proposals that are being put forward. My hon. Friend has suggested a way of incorporating our proposals in the proceedings—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will look at column 251 of yesterday's proceedings he will see that, in fact, the Minister gave details of the scheme almost to the length of a column.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. It is quite true that the President of the Board of Trade gave us a paraphrased précis of the document, and I am not saying he did it unfairly. But we are not talking about a paraphrased précis, which the President included in his speech for the purpose of convenience. To check a paraphrase or a précis we ought to have in front of us the whole of the document which some of us had not then but have now.<br><br>
But that is not the question. The question is whether the actual scheme is fair. That is what ought to be on the record, so that it can be read and compared with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
the agreement alleged to have been made. As this is an extremely important matter, it may be that the Committee feels that we should not continue with our proceedings until we have had much more information on the circumstances of the discussions that were held and the details of the absolutely monstrous and insupportable proposition upon which the main basis of the compensation scheme have been laid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must once again get back to the delay in letting Members of this Committtee have a copy of the scheme. I am excluding the Chairman in that in case I get into difficulties with the Chair. I think it is most unfair that there should have been this delay in putting a scheme like this, in which there are some fundamental principles involved, before Members of the Committee. One has a right, as a Member of this Committee, to see whether the basic principles of these proposals are in accordance with the principles which were considered by this House in the past when similar provisions and changes were made.<br><br>
I thought that the President was very weak yesterday. The best thing he could have done would have been to apologise most profusely to the Committee for the delay, and then to have adjourned the Sitting in order that we could make certain inquiries in connection with these proposals, and so that some of us could make certain comparisons with what has been done hitherto. I thought it was most disrespectful to suggest to the Committee that this document was in the Library at a time when this House was not sitting, and when it would have been most difficult and expensive for Members to come here to receive the information which they only received on the eve of considering this important proposal.<br><br>
It was said that it was in the "Manchester Guardian," as if that were quite conclusive evidence that everything was absolutely above board. What does it matter whether it was in the "Manchester Guardian," "The Times" or any other paper? The fact of the matter is that it was the responsibility of the President of the Board of Trade to see that every Member of this House had a copy of these important proposals.<br><br>
When I found out what had happened, I became a little bit suspicious and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
apprehensive. I have tried to make certain inquiries, and I am not at all surprised that there has been a great deal of veiling and secrecy about this thing. As far as my inquiries go—and I have done my best in the time available to make them as full as possible—no headquarters of any associations knows anything at all about this particular agreement.<br><br>
If that is so, then in my submission it is a most unusual way to treat not only the staff associations, but an important Committee of this House. After all is said and done, this embraces some most important principles. I have been through to responsible people on the National Staff side of the Whitley Council and to headquarters of associations whom I thought would have been responsible for the negotiations, but I cannot find any information about them at all.<br><br>
I have heard, however, a suggestion that a local branch has been dealing with this matter. It is a small branch, not the headquarters, of a particular association, the name of which I cannot even ascertain. They have said that their local branch has been discussing the matter and has recorded an agreement on it. My hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) said that certain things were fantastic. In my opinion, if what I have heard is true, then the whole of the negotiations have been fantastic. I at least would have thought that in an important matter like this, which was bound inevitably to be reported eventually to the Committee, at least the headquarters of the associations concerned would have been participating in the day-to-day negotiations on the agreement.<br><br>
I cannot vouch for this, but it has been given to me as the reason why the headquarters of the associations might not have been called into the negotiations. It was because there was some secrecy about them in the early stages. In other words, in those secret negotiations only those people on the spot would be entitled to give certain information. I do not know whether that is true, and it has only been put to me in an oblique way as a possible explanation. I should like to know whether that is so, and that is why I got on my feet.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
I think the Minister ought to get up immediately after I have sat down and explain the position. He has got a duty not only to me, but to the Chairman and to the rest of the Committee to get up immediately after I resume my seat and tell us exactly with whom the negotiations have been held, at what level they were conducted, and what steps were taken to ascertain whether the headquarters of the associations concerned were in full agreement with what has been done. Is it true to say that the headquarters were not brought into the negotiations on some alleged ground of secrecy? Could that secrecy have been such as to deny the associations the right to participate in the day-to-day negotiations at top level?<br><br>
I feel that the Minister's responsibility in this matter is most important. In my opinion, the President of the Board of Trade did not discharge that responsibility yesterday. My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock) gave him every opportunity to do so, but if there is a grain of truth in what I have heard, then I am not at all surprised that he was not as frank with this Committee as some of us would have liked him to be.<br><br>
I invite the Minister to deal with what I regard as a most important point from every aspect of this agreement. We were led to believe that it had been negotiated freely, frankly and openly with the organisations concerned. They were supposed to be so happy about it that there was really no need for this Committee to spend any time in trying to find out the basis of the agreement, or anything else. The Minister should reply to the pertinent points which have been put to him in order that the Committee may know something about these negotiations, and be able to form its conclusions upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. T. Proctor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself at all times opposed to the very principle of compensation, because it is based, first of all, on doing a person an injury and then compensating him for it. I am against doing him an injury at the start. I thought that the President of the Board of Trade stressed the same principle yesterday when he said that the scheme must be as generous and as adequate as possible for those injured. It was clearly an admission that this Government were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
injuring the workers concerned and then giving them compensation.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock) put some pertinent questions on the matter of the negotiations that were carried on. In reply, the President said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The answer is that they have seen this scheme and received it with every satisfaction."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that any trade union with which I have been associated would receive a scheme like this with every satisfaction. A man's job is abolished and he is given two weeks' compensation. We are led to believe that such a scheme is received by those concerned with every satisfaction. I cannot accept it. I hope we shall hear from the trade unions concerned about this matter.<br><br>
The President seemed to me to cast some doubt upon whether any negotiations had taken place at all, because he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This scheme worked out by the Commission has been submitted to us, and shown to the Staff Association."—.[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 20th January, 1954: c. 249.]</p></blockquote>
Whether they expressed their satisfaction with the privilege of seeing it or not, I do not know.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even that is a greater courtesy than was extended to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Proctor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long experience of this question of compensation. My experience of it has ranged over 30 years. Parliament takes a certain course with a certain industry and then arranges compensation. The first case I can recollect is the 1921 Railways Act, where the procedure followed was that Parliament, to the great satisfaction of the General Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, laid down exactly similar arrangements for compensation both for directors and for the wages staff in connection with the amalgamation of the railways. Needless to say, the directors got their compensation immediately but the workers had to go through the courts and to spend thousands of pounds before they received what was their due.<br><br>
The compensation scheme here seems to have had no adequate consideration by the Government. One of the first
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
points which should be considered when changing the basis of an industry or an organisation such as this is, what is to be the fate of the employees and their jobs? No adequate consideration seems to have been given by the Government as to who is to perform these necessary functions in the cotton industry and whether the personnel employed by the Cotton Commission are to have any opportunity of employment there. I should have thought the President of the Board of Trade would have given us some indication that the Minister of Labour was interesting himself in this matter.<br><br>
I have had several letters from people who are losing their employment from the cotton industry, and they make tragic and pathetic reading. One man asked me whether I could intervene in some other industry to try to get him a job. This is a matter which should have been receiving the most careful consideration of the Government. We should have been given some report about it. The present method of dealing with it indicates exactly how the Tory mind works; the interest of the workers does not matter at all and the whole affair can be dealt with in this cavalier fashion—even hon. Members of this Committee can be ignored in the sending round of the documents. We received those documents through the post and that, I think, is a very unusual way of bringing to the notice of the Committee the very grave principles which are concerned here.<br><br>
Yesterday, when we were dealing with this matter, several hon. Members said they had not received the document in question. I had my copy with me and another hon. Member borrowed it. This morning I went to see whether there were any spare copies, but none was available to the Committee this morning. In my opinion, we should consider whether the Committee would not be wise to adjourn to enable the Minister to look again at everything connected with this business. If any negotiations have taken place the Committee should be placed in possession of the facts. Perhaps a verbatim report of the negotiations is available somewhere.<br><br>
Why this extraordinary difference between the salaried and the wages staff under the compensation Clauses? It has been stated that four times as much compensation will be paid to those on a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
monthly salary basis than to those paid on a weekly basis. Indeed, I think it is more than four times as much. The President, in answering that point, said we must have some regard to the views of the people who are to be compensated. If he had regard to the views of the weekly-paid staff who are to be compensated, then he would certainly be told that they wanted to be placed on the same basis as that of the salaried staff.<br><br>
I hope we shall give this matter very careful consideration. I hope we shall not part with it this morning but, instead, ask the Minister to have another look at it. Quite possibly he himself does not know what negotiations have taken place. I hope he will give us a full report upon them and will see whether, if possible, the workers who are to be displaced can be told that they will be given some advantage in seeking employment with the new organisation which is to be set up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I should bring the attention of the Committee to the fact that there is now quite clearly a tendency for us to have the discussion which would arise on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." We have heard two or three speeches without any reference to the Amendment before us. We have tended to discuss the scheme which the Minister submitted to the Committee yesterday in reply to the Amendment. I thought I should inform the Committee that I am conscious that we are having a wide discussion, which would normally take place on the Question, "That the Cause stand part of the Bill," since no reference has been made so far this morning to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I think the Committee are very grateful to you, Mr. Thomas, for indicating what is in your mind here, but, dealing with the relevance of the discussion so far to the Amendment before the Committee, I submit that the discussion is entirely relevant because, as my hon. Friend for Liverpool, Exchange said in moving it, the Amendment is intended as an alternative to the Government's contemplated compensation scheme. We therefore cannot make up our minds whether or not to accept the Amendment until we know
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
what it is intended to be a substitute for and what we think of the substitute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The remarks I want to make on the Amendment are directly related to it, although there are a number of very much wider points which I should like to put to the Committee, and I trust that there will be an opportunity of doing so on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." There are some very important points to be made on this subject.<br><br>
I want for a moment to direct the attention of the Committee to specific points in the Amendment, and, in particular, to press the Minister to make a statement in answer to some of the very important questions which have been put to him. A number of my hon. Friends desire to speak, and I must make it plain that they have the right to speak because they represent constituencies with a very real interest in this matter and they know a great deal more about the problems involved in the Amendment than do most hon. Members opposite, and certainly far more than the Government know. But before my hon. Friends can make much further contribution on the point—and I think they will agree with me—we ought to have a statement from the Minister which can form a basis for further constructive remarks which I know will be made from this side of the Committee.<br><br>
May I refer, in passing, to the fact that the President of the Board of Trade is not here? A number of my hon. Friends have mentioned that, and I ought perhaps to make it clear that he told me last night that he would not be able to be here because of a Cabinet meeting. I think we understand that, and I hope my hon. Friends will agree that it is arguable whether he is doing more harm here or there, any way, because we do not know what is being discussed there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is becoming almost a habit of the President of the Board of Trade to start a hare, get himself into a lot of trouble, and then run away to a Cabinet meeting and leave his deputy to deal with the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To be fair to the President of the Board of Trade, I must deprecate my hon. Friend's remarks. It is general knowledge in Lancashire that it was not the President who started this hare but the Minister of Materials, the Chancellor
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
of the Duchy of Lancaster, against the President's view. Let us hope that at the Cabinet this morning the President is attempting to persuade his noble Friend that this Bill should be dropped, in which case we will heartily give him leave of absence from the Committee.<br><br>
I agree that in certain respects the Amendment might be better worded, and we do not stand on every detail of the wording. We seek in the Amendment to enunciate three principles, and if the Minister will say that he accepts those three principles and will put them in the scheme, I shall be happy to expedite the work of the Committee by withdrawing the Amendment immediately. That is all he has to do.<br><br>
The first of the three principles which we seek to set out is that there should be equality of treatment between all classes involved in these redundancies—that is, between classes who were redundant before the Bill was introduced. those who are becoming redundant now, and thirdly, those who may become redundant after the Raw Cotton Commission has been abolished, as the Government has threatened to abolish it.<br><br>
I think that the President of the Board of Trade yesterday accepted that principle of equality, although I am not at all satisfied that it has been established in relation to the period of notice, which is also relevant, in addition to the lump sum of compensation; and I hope the Minister of State will answer the points made by my hon. Friends yesterday on that question.<br><br>
The second principle which is contained in the Amendment is that of equality of treatment between salaried staffs and the weekly wage-paid staffs. If there is anything in the scheme which we so belatedly received—or which most hon. Members so belatedly received—which sticks in the gullet of the Committee it is this discrimination between the monthly-paid staffs and the weekly-paid staffs. Some illustrations have been given of the effects of this discrimination. It does not require a very competent statistician to work out that, roughly speaking, something like four or four and one-third times as much compensation is to be paid to the monthly-paid staff as to the weekly-paid men for comparable periods of service. I have been given illustrations of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
how this will work, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock).<br><br>
Let us take the example of a disabled messenger of 50 years of age. I can assure the Minister that this man will not find it easy to get a job on Merseyside in present conditions. He had been getting about £6 10s. a week under the Commission. Assuming that he has three years service, he will get compensation amounting to £26, or roughly speaking, three weeks wages; and he will be very lucky if he gets a job in Liverpool in less than three weeks. On the other hand, a clerk aged 30, who has been getting £8 a week but has been paid monthly, and who has three years service—indeed, joined the service of the Commission on the same day as the disabled messenger—will get not £26 but £140 compensation. The Committee will see the very serious differentiation in treatment. That is the second point of principle in the Amendment.<br><br>
I do not intend to say very much about the third point, which is the issue of superannuation. I do not think the President dealt with this point very well yesterday. What he said was that the men could get their money back, but of course we recognise that in these superannuation schemes the employers' half of the payment is, in effect, a form of deferred pay, and we therefore claim in the Amendment that the employers' contribution should also be repaid. I will not argue about the appropriate rate of interest because the Government keep changing their minds about what is the appropriate rate of interest in this country, but whatever is the appropriate rate, that interest should be paid on these accumulated amounts.<br><br>
The President of the Board of Trade made a statement yesterday, and, as my hon. Friends have said this morning, we thought it was a very cavalier statement. It was fairly lengthy, and part was the reading of a document or the paraphrasing of a document, which was certainly necessary; and it all seemed to add up to only one argument.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
That is all we got from the President. He asked how he could intervene when it was an agreed scheme, but I should like to ask him a little bit more about the agreed scheme, and I hope the right hon.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
Gentleman will reply to the point made from my hon. Friend the Member for Droylsden (Mr. W. R. Williams), who wants to know with whom the scheme was agreed. The President seems to think that it is a conclusive and final argument about the scheme that it was agreed with the staff association; frankly, we do not.<br><br>
In the first place, owing to the harsh manner in which this whole question was being operated, it looked as if no compensation would be possible at all until hon. Members on this side of the Committee intervened in the debate last July, when I pressed the President of the Board of Trade very strongly to introduce a compensation scheme, and when it was quite obvious that he had not given a moment's thought to the idea at all. Against that background, any staff association would be relatively pleased if a scheme is put forward.<br><br>
Of course, I do not know anything about this staff association, and we have been told nothing about it. To my mind, it rather smacks of a sort of company union, and it does not seem to me to be a powerful staff association representing the national workers whose members are working. It is in the nature of a company union, and, in the last resort, whatever the employers say goes. That is what seems to me to have happened in this case.<br><br>
If the Minister's only argument is that this has been accepted by the staff side, does he think that the staff side would not have accepted a proposal to give the same treatment to the weekly paid staff as to the monthly paid staff? Will he say that the staff side were against the principle of equality between the weekly and the monthly paid staff? They accepted this scheme because they knew they could not get anything better from this Government. Will the Minister tell us that they would not agree if the terms had been, not more generous, but more just, with more equity between the different classes involved, and that such a settlement would not have been accepted by the staff side?<br><br>
On behalf of this side of the Committee, I am prepared to make an offer to the Minister. I am prepared to offer to withdraw this Amendment if he will tell us today that he will go back to the staff
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
side and propose to them those things which we are proposing in this Amendment. If his only argument is that the staff side have accepted it, I want to test the good faith of the Government in this question.<br><br>
The Minister should go back to the staff side and tell them that he will start with the existing document as a basis for discussion, that he will work on the principle of equality between the weekly and monthly paid staff, and that he will also remove the other anomaly to which my hon. Friend the Member for the Exchange Division of Liverpool (Mrs. Braddock) drew attention yesterday in connection with the months' or weeks' compensation in relation to complete years of service.<br><br>
There is a very simple way round it. The Raw Cotton Commission need only offer one-twelfth of a year's salary for each month of service, and that will deal with the problem of those who have worked for periods of 10 or 11 months, but not for a complete year.<br><br>
I therefore suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that he should go back to the staff association, and should inform us at a later stage—perhaps on Report stage—what was the result of these talks. If he tells us on Report stage that the staff association have turned down our proposal, we will accept that, provided we are satisfied that there has been adequate discussion, but I am pretty confident that, if the right hon. Gentleman puts our proposals to the staff association, the President will be able to tell us that this is a good scheme because the staff association have accepted it.<br><br>
I make this offer to the right hon. Gentleman. He should take the existing scheme and alter it to give equality between the weekly and monthly paid staff, introduce the question of one-twelfth of the appropriate lump sum for each month of service and put that to the staff association. If he tells us that he will do that, we shall quite happily withdraw this Amendment and not seek to move it again at a later stage of the Bill, if we are satisfied that he has put it to the staff side. Personally, I am confident that the staff association will be likely to accept such a proposal, but, if he tells us quite honestly that the staff of the Raw Cotton Commission are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
in favour of discrimination between the weekly and the monthly paid staff, we shall have no more to say.<br><br>
I do not want to take more time, because we all want to get on to Clause 4, the most important Clause in the Bill, to which we want to give our full attention, and so I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman a way in which he can speed up the activities of this Committee and at the same time give justice to those affected by this Bill. There are other questions of a rather wider nature that I would hope to introduce, but I have tried, I hope successfully, to confine myself specifically to the details of this Amendment. I hope there will be an opportunity at a later stage for me to make the rather wider points on compensation which I think ought to be deployed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to try to deal with some, even all, of the points that have been raised during this Debate. We have had a pretty full Debate on the Amendment, and a good deal has been said about the scheme which has been put forward and agreed by the Raw Cotton Commission and the staff association.<br><br>
At the outset, I should like to say a few words about the question which several hon. Members have raised about the sending out of this paper describing the scheme. My right hon. Friend yesterday expressed his apologies that the document had not been placed in the hands of hon. Members before it was, but most hon. Members received it on the evening before we met on Tuesday. There is also the fact which has been mentioned that it was placed in the Library on 3rd December, and that it appeared in one national newspaper on 8th November. As regards your copy, Mr. Thomas, I am informed that it was sent to you at the same time and I am surprised that you did not receive it and that it was not in your personal possession before we met yesterday. That is what I am informed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister, but I ought to explain that I would not have had to have risen if I had had my copy, and it has not arrived yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, I deeply regret it, and I will look into the matter. I should have liked to arrange for you to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
have had your copy before, and we are all sorry that hon. Members did not have the opportunity of perusing that paper for some time before our meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Braddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say if it will be published in any official document?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have taken note of that point. It may be desirable that hon. Members of the House generally, apart from Members of this Committee, would like to know about the scheme, and so I will look into it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will go further than look into it. Despite his apology, there was a considerable period before we got a simple document circulated. The Minister apologises, but he does not tell us how it happened. My hon. Friend the Member for the Exchange Division has raised a serious point of principle regarding publication. This is not only a question interesting Members of Parliament, but also members of the public, because many of the public are following these debates in the HANSARD reports of the Standing Committee, and I think those reports will be almost incomprehensible unless the document is published.<br><br>
If there are any difficulties about publishing it in the OFFICIAL REPORT of the Committee's 'proceedings, it will be a simple thing to arrange through the usual channels for a friendly Question to be put down—and, if not, we will put down an unfriendly Question—on the Floor of the House to ask for this document to be printed in HANSARD.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Braddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be in order for an hon. Member of the Committee on the other side to read the paper, when it would automatically be included in the Report of the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will look into the question in order to see if there is a way of meeting the wishes that have been expressed, but I do not want to take up time by reading the document again, because I am sure that every hon. Member is well aware of its contents.<br><br>
I should like to turn now to the point raised by the hon. Member for Droylsden (Mr. W. Williams) about the discussions which took place with the staff
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
association. The staff association of the Raw Cotton Commission is a branch of the Society of Civil Servants, and it seems to me to be entirely appropriate that the discussions in this case should have taken place between the branch which is associated with the Raw Cotton Commission, and that is where, in fact, the discussions did take place. Whether the staff association reported the result of those discussions or their own views to the headquarters of the Society of Civil Servants I have no knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say whether, first of all, the messengers, and secondly, the considerable number of warehousemen and weekly paid staff have been consulted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that the staff association covers all established members of the staff, whether they are paid monthly or weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leslie Hale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can we be told how many weekly wage earners are established, what percentage and how many there are, and how many representatives they have on the staff side?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the 19th January, 1954, there were 234 established and 143 temporary workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Weekly wage earners?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am sorry I have not got the details as between monthly and weekly paid employees, but I will see if the information is available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister, in all seriousness, tell this Committee that an important matter like this was just raised with a local branch of an organisation, whatever that organisation might be, and that his Department, an important Department of State, which has been dealing with staff problems from time immemorial on a general and national basis with the headquarters of an association, in this case was dealing solely and quite independently with a local branch, whether it be at Liverpool or anywhere else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could we have this point cleared up? Is it not a fact that the Department of my right hon. Friend—the Board of Trade—has not been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
carrying on these negotiations? Was it not the Raw Cotton Commission—the employers—and the people concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This seems to me to be eminently a matter for the Raw Cotton Commission and not for my Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue which has just been put forward involves the privilege of the Committee and of hon. Members. These were the negotiations for the Bill, for spending money that will come out of public funds. They were the negotiations in which the President of the Board of Trade was concerned, but now we are told that they had nothing to do with the Board of Trade but were a matter entirely for an independent body. How can we discuss anything reasonably if matters are conducted in this way? Is it really proper and appropriate for the right hon. Gentleman to say that he does not know anything about the negotiations because he was not responsible for them? This makes nonsense of the whole procedure.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member, and I think that the Minister might now be permitted to continue his reply to the debate. The very fact that we have discussed this statement, to which extensive reference has been made by the Minister of State, by the President of the Board of Trade and by Members of the Committee, makes it clear that we accept that it is within our own purview.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Further to the point of order raised by the hon. Gentleman, I made no remark that could be interpreted as meaning that this Committee has no jurisdiction over the results of the negotiations. My remarks were confined entirely to the point made by the hon. Gentleman opposite about who carried on the negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but further to that, Mr. Thomas—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it a point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir. I want to ask the Minister whether in the long run—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not a point of order if the hon. Gentleman wishes to question the Minister, Mr. Amory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to endorse what my hon. Friend has said already, that neither his remarks nor mine were at all in line with the interpretation placed upon them by the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale). Surely the results of the negotiations in this case must be approved by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Materials? That does not mean, however, that it is necessary for our Departments to intervene in the negotiations, which seem to me to be properly a matter for the Raw Cotton Commission and the staff association.<br><br>
I want to ask the hon. Member for Droylsden (Mr. W. R. Williams) whether he thinks it conceivable that if the staff association was not satisfied with the result of those negotiations it would not have got in touch with the headquarters of the union which would, no doubt, have made representations at a higher level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. It is not a question of whether it would have got in touch with the headquarters of the union. That is not a matter for this House. What I am concerned with is the normal procedure in matters of this kind, namely, that Government Departments, commissions or boards working on behalf of Government Departments and of this House, have a responsibility to get into touch with the headquarters of the organisation concerned. They never deal with important points of detail like this over which the House of Commons has some control and determination, without going to headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is our responsibility to approve, but not necessarily to negotiate. The procedure which has been followed in this case is entirely appropriate to the circumstances. Also it is a fact worth remembering that on the Raw Cotton Commission we have two competent and keen trades union representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must really face up to this matter. We asked if the men were represented, and the right hon. Gentleman said that he did not know, but would find out. He spoke about negotiations with the local staff branch of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
Civil Servants' Association. Does that Association represent porters, warehousemen—weekly wage earners—or does it not? That is the question and the right hon. Gentleman should not ride off after the letter which my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock) read yesterday, because the previous staff said that when they wrote and complained about the provisions they could not even get an acknowledgment from the deputy-chairman. Therefore it is vital that we should be told, and I suggest that at this stage we should consider moving the Adjournment of the Committee until we get the information. It is vital that we should know whether these people who were so badly treated, the weekly wage earners, were adequately represented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Oldham, West has again misinterpreted my remarks. I gave a perfectly clear answer, that the staff association covered all established members of the staff, whether monthly or weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman then said he did not know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I could not give an immediate answer on, though I have promised to obtain the information, was the number of weekly members of the staff as against the monthly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene again. Are we to understand from that statement that there must be well over 100 people who would not be represented at all in these negotiations? From my knowledge, the Society of Civil Servants does not take within its membership doorkeepers, messengers and other people. Who has been representing them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The staff association representing the established members of the staff, but I understand that in informal discussions the staff association speaks for all members of the staff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Keenan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has no right to do so in this case if the weekly wage earners are treated separately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must remember the nature of the Raw Cotton Commission and its staff association. It is not a colossal, widely spreading, comprehensive body. The total staff is under 1,000, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 305</span>
the relations between the Commission and the staff are pretty intimate and close.<br><br>
I pass now to one or two other points that have been raised. On the Amendment itself, I repeat that it seems to us on this side of the Committee that the scheme described in the Amendment would not be either such a good scheme or such a generous scheme as that which has been agreed between the Raw Cotton Commission and the staff. We think that the age and service basis inherent in the scheme we have put forward is the best one.<br><br>
I think it was the hon. Member for Oldham, West who put forward the view that age and service was not a good basis and that the shorter the service the greater should be the compensation. We are accustomed to interesting and sometimes novel suggestions from the hon. Gentleman but I doubt whether this view on that point would carry general approval.<br><br>
In the scheme put forward by the Raw Cotton Commission there are interesting and valuable options under the heading of pensions. When a member of the staff comes to retiring age, he can either draw what his pension is worth without further payment or he can continue the payments himself until he retires, or withdraw his payments out of the pension scheme and terminate it altogether, or, if he is over 40, he can continue and the Commission will pay a lump sum for future commitments.<br><br>
All those are valuable options, and it seems to us that the pension proposals in the Amendment would not be as favourable. The Amendment suggests that the employer's contribution should be returned as well as that of the employee. Large scale retirements are provided for in the insurance scheme now in force and it makes provision for the return of the member's contributions but not the employer's contributions, so the suggestion in the Amendment would be a departure from the scheme in force at present. Also I cannot find any precedents for returning the employer's contributions to the employee in such cases.<br><br>
I want to take this opportunity of correcting a misunderstanding on the part of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock). There is no obligation on the member who wants to avail himself of any these options for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
pension to remain working in the cotton industry. He can work in any other job or he need not work in a job at all, and if he likes to continue his contributions the pension will be available to him when the time comes.<br><br>
I now want to refer to the question of the monthly and weekly wage earners. Here we get involved in quite a wide question as to whether there is justification for monthly terms as against weekly terms or vice versa. We must, however, face facts and remember that there are these two different bases of remuneration and employment, monthly and weekly, each of them carrying different terms of notice and different conditions. All we are doing—and again we are in line with all precedent—is to accept that situation and to apply different periods of compensation in line with the terms of employment. We are doing no more than that, and I suggest that we should be going rather wide if we entered into a discussion of the merits of monthly and weekly periods of service.<br><br>
I was asked whether I thought the staff association would have accepted more generous terms for the weekly wage earners. It is purely hypothetical. I do not know—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Find out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—but I suggest that it would certainly have accepted anything more generous for its members provided that this did not injure other arrangements. That would be only human.<br><br>
The hon. Lady the Member for Liverpool, Exchange raised a point yesterday with which we have much sympathy. It often happens that when a line is drawn—and we have to draw lines in these kinds of settlements—there are people who fall one day short. The scheme provided for service to be calculated to the latest completed year. We would like to look into this a little further to see whether we can do something to substitute perhaps a shorter period, such as the latest completed six months, or something else, to try to reduce any hardship that may arise. I am afraid, however, that whatever we do there are bound to be some people who fall a day short. I would like to leave that by saying that we will have discussions with the Raw Cotton Commission and those concerned to see whether we can find
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
a workable proposition which will go some way to meeting the point made by the hon. Lady. I have dealt with her other point about future service in the cotton industry, which is not necessary in order that members shall avail themselves of the pension provisions.<br><br>
I was asked just now what steps we had taken, if any, to try to find reemployment for redundant members of the staff. The Liverpool Cotton Association was asked some time ago if it would bear in mind those members of the staff who were likely to be displaced as a result of the new arrangements when opportunities for employment arose. The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners was also asked again to put these people on its list and to remember them, in connection with any vacancies which crop up. The Federation circularised all its members on this point and, of course, the Ministry of Labour, on this occasion as on all others, will be helpful in trying to find openings. I agree that nowadays, particularly for those over 45, it is not an easy job to find suitable employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, a large number of men have already been made redundant. Could he tell us what percentage of those have found employment and what percentage has been found employment by the Liverpool Cotton Association?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I saw the figures at our last meeting just before Christmas, but I have not got them in my head. However, those figures showed that the number absorbed was satisfactory. I will find out the latest figures because it is an important point but, with quite a small number of exceptions, I believe that by that date most of the people concerned had found alternative employment.<br><br>
I have tried to deal with most of the points. I suggest that we have had a long and full discussion of the Amendment and I hope very much that the Committee will now find it possible to reach a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Gentleman sits down, he could help the Committee to reach a decision much more quickly if he would pay a little more attention to the proposal I made. The right hon. Gentleman has now demolished
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
the sole argument of the President of the Board of Trade that this was agreed by the staff association. He has also agreed that almost certainly the staff association would be prepared and likely to accept the Amendment we have proposed to put the weekly paid staff on the same basis as the monthly paid staff. Since the only argument produced is that the staff association like this scheme will he take our proposals, seek to marry them into the scheme, and put them to the staff association? If he will undertake to do that, we will ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.<br><br>
We thank the Minister for the small concession about the six months although it seems like being a half-year job and not a monthly job as we wanted. On the major point, which is not a question of "the nicely calculated less or more," but is a question of the principle of equality of treatment, will he now accept these proposals, put them to the staff association, and report to us at the Report stage? If so, we can certainly help him to expedite the work of the Committee as far as this Amendment is concerned.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keenan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get out of order, but I think that the fact that we have not had assurances from the Minister which, seemingly, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee wanted, is a pity. There seems some doubt as to whether this document on compensation should be published. The only way in which that can be done is for an hon. Member to take the opportunity to read from it for the benefit of the Committee. I ask if I should be out of order in reading the whole of what has been circulated by the Board of Trade on this question of compensation as I believe it is fundamental to the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before giving your Ruling, Mr. Thomas, may I ask you to consider the aspect of tedious repetition in this matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to ask the hon. Member for Kirkdale (Mr. Keenan) if he would spare us that difficulty. I hope he will not insist on taking the course he has suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keenan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is that we could get no assurances that there will be a repeat of these terms. Obviously the number of typewritten copies is limited,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 309</span>
otherwise the Minister would readily have supplied you, Mr. Thomas, and others with copies. If I may be permitted to do so I would meet you half way and point out what the document states under the heading "Gratuity." This is to show the fundamental basis on which the discussion has proceeded. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The amount to be paid will be:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(i) for monthly paid staff, a lump sum of two months' salary for the first complete year of service with the Commission plus one month's salary for each additional complete year's service with the Commission."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will read the OFFICIAL REPORT of yesterday's Sitting he will find that these relevant paragraphs were read by two hon. Members in succession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keenan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for that, Mr. Thomas; it will save me the trouble of reading the next paragraph. I wanted to be sure of that.<br><br>
A number of matters have arisen in discussion of this Amendment which merit some further comment. My hon. Friend the Member for Droylsden (Mr. W. R. Williams) has dealt very fully with the matter. It is clear that whoever represented the Board of Trade did not know sufficient about wage negotiations of this kind. After listening to what has been said on both sides of the Committee, I am of the opinion that what has taken place is certainly not the kind of trade union negotiation with which I have been concerned all my life. It seems obvious that many if not all of the 159 temporary civil servants, including the weekly wage staffs, have had no representation on their behalf.<br><br>
I take it that the negotiations have taken place with the Staff Side of the Civil Service. One does not find the doorkeeper or messenger on any committee of an association involved in such negotiations. If further proof is needed in support of my contention, it is in the terms of the agreement which is suggested here. The fact that the weekly wage earner, who generally speaking gets less than those on the salaried staff, is to get only one quarter of the proportion is an indication that they had no representation at all. It would appear that very few if any would be in an association or would have any representation made on their behalf.<br><br>
With due respect, the Minister did not seem well briefed on the question or to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
know much about it. He was only able to answer in a broad way the questions put to him. As it is clear that there was not adequate, if any, representation of the weekly wage staff, I think the Minister ought to have another look at the matter. The weekly wage earners are to have one week's compensation payment for each additional year of service as against one month's payment for the salaried staff.<br><br>
If hon. Members of the Committee look back to the proceedings of the third and fourth Sittings they will recall the hubbub and the great concern which was expressed about the Raw Cotton Commission. Great tributes were paid to its Chairman, and they were probably deserved. There are hon. Members here who are more competent than I to express an opinion about that. There was concern, and compensation seemed desirable. I suggested that we ought to consider retaining the Chairman for another six months, but he had already been absorbed into the industry in another capacity. I want the Committee to realise that concern is being expressed for those at the top and for the salaried staff as against the wage earner. That is a class distinction which is characteristic of proceedings of this kind. No one on the Government side of the Committee has even expressed the slightest regret that such out-of-date methods should continue.<br><br>
Another point which was effectively made by my hon. Friend the Member for Droylsden was the basis on which the negotiation took place. In the trade union movement, I have never known a particular branch, no matter how important, to make a settlement of this kind on the basis of compensation or wage claims. Generally it is done by the area or the district concerned and not by single branches. It is a hole and corner way to deal with the matter by negotiating with the staff association and expecting those who are to be dismissed to negotiate reasonably and with some courage.<br><br>
Whoever were responsible for the negotiations either had no experience of similar negotiations or were doing some- thing contrary to the spirit of negotiations which has been characteristic of Government Departments for the last generation. That consideration should cause the Minister to withdraw the whole Clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 311</span>
and to do what we suggest in the Amendment—have another look at it and come to a more reasoned and better decision.<br><br>
On the question of finding employment for some of the staffs who are displaced, I recall that at the end of the war, when the Liverpool Cotton Exchange realised that they were not to resume, I went to see the late Sir Stafford Cripps who was then President of the Board of Trade. I was accompanied by some of those concerned to see if something could be done for them. We now have an indication that the Government are compelled to do better for their employees than are employers in outside industry. Although there is still this class distinction between individuals—those in the better paid posts on a monthly basis as against those on the weekly basis—we welcome this change.</span></p>

<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greenwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The people of Lancashire will have noted with great interest that this morning's discussion on a matter,</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
<p>However, we ought not to be satisfied with what is likely to take place, and I think that the least the Minister should do, having listened to what has been said this morning as indicating how unfair, how illogical and how mistaken is the whole basis of these negotiations, is to withdraw the Clause and to accept the Amendment. That at any rate would give him an opportunity of meeting some of the justifiable criticism which has been put forward in discussing the Amendment.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> "That the Question be now put."</span></p>

<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 12; Noes, 21.</p>
<p>which vitally affects them, has been cut short by the vote of the representatives of the suburbs of London and other parts of the country, and that their elected representatives on this side of the Committee were not allowed to make perfectly legitimate contributions to this debate. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
seems to me a little unfortunate that they were very anxious to stop the Lancashire and Cheshire representatives on this side of the Committee contributing to our discussion when throughout they showed an embarrassing reluctance to do so themselves.</p>
<p>I am disturbed that we should find the Minister of State in another embarrassing situation. The Minister of State is my second favourite Minister, and I view with some reluctance the way in which he is constantly left by the President of the Board of Trade to hold some repulsive and unmanageable baby.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. F. Blackburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend tell us who is his first favourite Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry, but the Committee must remain uninformed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greenwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Thomas, for that, because my favourite Minister is not a Member of this Committee, and it would not be proper for me to refer to him on this occasion. It was a little unfortunate that there was another incident just before Christmas when, once again, the Minister of State was left in the difficulty of answering abstruse points which the President of the Board of Trade might have dealt with, and on which he could have had assistance from a Law Officer of the Crown had one been present. Now, once again, we find that the right hon. Gentleman is in a similar difficulty.<br><br>
Much as I like and admire the Minister of State, I found the explanation he offered today wholly unconvincing. Before we allow this Clause to be reported to the House we must know more about it. I can understand the Minister of State saying, as, of course, he has a perfect right to say, that the principal body negotiating this agreement on the part of the Royal Cotton Commission must be the Commission itself. But the Royal Cotton Commission has not got any funds at its disposal to make available for any purpose of this kind, and sooner or later it is going to be the National Exchequer which is going to be left holding the responsibility.<br><br>
I cannot believe that the Royal Cotton Commission did not carry on some discussions with the President of the Board of Trade and with the Staff Association. I find it very difficult to believe that Her
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
Majesty's Treasury did not express any opinion upon this fairly substantial point and I should like to know what discussions have taken place between the President of the Board of Trade, and the Royal Cotton Commission. Has the scheme submitted by the Commission been approved by the President of the Board of Trade and approved by the Treasury?<br><br>
There is a number of other relevant matters of that kind, but the real crux of the case which we on this side of the Committee are making is, what other associations took part in these discussions? All that we have learned from the Minister of State this morning is that the Royal Cotton Commission employed 334 established workers and 143 temporary workers. When we asked the Minister of State—and this is a very relevant point—what proportion of this staff was weekly paid and what proportion was monthly paid, he was unable to tell us. I have a pretty shrewd suspicion that if the President of the Board of Trade were here he would not have been able to give us those figures either. It does suggest a certain casualness and lack of sense of responsibility on the part of the Minister in not putting us in possession of those facts.<br><br>
The Minister of State is always fair and open with the Committee, but all we have learned from him this morning is that negotiations have taken place with the Staff Association. When we are told that it is the Staff Association, we must assume that it is apparently some section of the Society of Civil Servants. In the days when I was a civil servant, and being a strong believer in the principle of trade unionism, I naturally joined the Civil Service Clerical Association, but after 18 months, because apparently of my industry and application, I was informed that I had moved into a grade in the Civil Service where it was not appropriate that I should continue membership of the Civil Service Clerical Association. I then transferred my membership to the Society of Civil Servants.<br><br>
My impression of the Society of Civil Servants, for which I have a great respect within its own particular sphere of operation, is that, normally, it only acts for monthly paid staff, and I cannot remember any organisation which exists primarily to protect the interests of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
monthly paid staff being in a position to negotiate on behalf of weekly paid employees. It is too much for the Minister to ask this Committee—and incidentally all the members of the Committee on this side have some experience of the textile industry—to believe that no other unions should have been taken within the scope of these negotiations.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Thornton), is a prominent member of the Textile Factory Workers' Union, and my hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price) is a member of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers. Surely those unions must have been involved in some way in these discussions. After all this Bill deals with the purchase of raw cotton, and it is difficult to imagine raw cotton being purchased without having warehouses in which to put it. In the discussions which have taken place on compensation surely the National Union of Textile Warehousemen had something to say.<br><br>
It is impossible to believe that the Transport and General Workers' Union, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkdale (Mr. Keenan) and I are members, should not have taken part in those discussions. The weekly paid staff should have been represented by the Transport and General Workers' Union, the National Union of General and Municipal Workers and other unions of that kind. All of those to which I have referred must have had some interest in the negotiations which have taken place, and I would not like to overlook the claim of the National Union of Clerks and Distributive Workers, which must have had some workers in the employment of the Commission.<br><br>
It is difficult to know what form these discussions could have taken. We are now left in rather inadequate possession of the facts as to who was present at these negotiations, nor do we know what form these discussions took. Yesterday the President of the Board of Trade told us:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Scheme worked out by the Commission has been … shown to the Staff Association."</p></blockquote>
In the next column he became much more enthusiastic about it and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has been shown to the Staff Association and received with every satisfaction."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
It sounds very much like the Association touching its cap and saying, "Thank you, gentlemen, for what you are so kindly doing for us." Then on the next page the President made the claim that the scheme had been
<br><blockquote><p>"broadly agreed."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 12th January, 1954; c. 249, 250 and 253.]</p></blockquote>
We should know from the Minister of State whether the scheme was shown to the staff association and whether they had to accept it as it was; whether it was received with every satisfaction, as the President has told us, or whether it was only broadly agreed.<br><br>
Then we should like to know who agreed. Was this a unanimous agreement on the part of the staff? Will the Minister of State tell us what steps the staff association took to refer back to its members the proposed scheme for compensation? These are points on which the Minister of State ought to be informed, and about which he should frankly tell the Committee. We still do not know who took part in the discussions. We do not know what form the discussions took, and we do not know whether the agreement which was reached was unanimously endorsed by the workers who were involved.<br><br>
The last point I wish to make is a simple one, but one which I think is of considerable importance. We are at the moment in the process of winding up a nationalised undertaking. It is of the utmost importance that when a step of this kind is being taken, the Government should do everything in their power to ensure that the organisation comes to an end without any feeling of injustice on the part of the people who have been employed by it.<br><br>
The State in this country, although it has not always been one of the most generous employers, has always been one of the fairest. I would not like it to be thought by people, contemplating in the future taking employment in some form of a nationalised undertaking, that they make in a few years, when a change of Government takes place, be left in the position in which they would not be properly and fairly treated by their State employers.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us upon the doubts which have been expressed this morning, so that it may be possible on some future
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
occasion of this kind for workers to know that, if the organisation is affected, they will be taken within the scope of the discussions, and that nobody in the future need have the slightest anxiety about taking employment in nationalised industries for fear that a change of Government will bring injustice and hardship to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frederick Lee</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State this morning told us a very different story from that which the President of the Board of Trade told us when we last met. The President sought to convince us by this statement which I take from yesterday's proceedings:
<br><blockquote><p>"If hon. Members wish to put forward other schemes during the discussion they are entitled to do so but what I have to consider, and the Committee also has to consider it, is the scheme which has been put forward by the Commission and received with great satisfaction by the staff association."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 20th January, 1954; c. 253.]</p></blockquote>
If the Minister of State's speech this morning revealed anything, it revealed that he and his right hon. Friend did not know the reaction of the staff to the proposals in the scheme for compensation.<br><br>
It is the job of the Committee to consider two very vital aspects of this matter. First, when we consider this compensation scheme we must think of the redundancy, for which we are making provision, which has been artificially generated by the Government themselves. We have precedents over the years showing how people who are made redundant when redundancy is artificially created have, in fact, been treated. One can recall certain big industrialists who have been compensated with many thousands of pounds. That is one aspect of the matter which we must consider when we are determining what is right and proper compensation for those who have been deliberately made redundant.<br><br>
I should have thought that the hon. Members, who so avidly gripped hold of the gag a few minutes ago to silence the Committee, might have considered their responsibilities as Members of the House of Commons.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I challenge any hon. Member opposite to say how much this scheme will cost. I challenge the Minister to tell me how much it will cost. The Minister has been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
asked by several of my hon. Friends what is the ratio between the monthly and the weekly staff, and he does not know. What a difference it would make to our deliberations and to the decisions which we reach if the apportionment were 10 weekly staff to 300 or 400 monthly staff.<br><br>
We know from the Minister that at a certain date there were 334 established employees and 143 who were not established, but that does not tell us whether the 143 or any proportion of that number are weekly or monthly staff. This Committee therefore rushed hastily to a decision to back this scheme without a single hon. Member who backed it being able to tell his constituents how much it will cost. I should have thought that was pretty disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened for a long time to this discussion about who was and who was not consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lee</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not dealing with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not complaining of the hon. Member. Neither his right hon. Friend nor his hon. Friends have dealt with the principle: do they or do they not agree that there is a right to discriminate in the extent of compensation in relation to the difficulties which might be experienced in finding alternative employment? Quite clearly it may take much more time for a man to find a job which is worth £1,000 a year or £1,500 a year than for a man who is working as a messenger or a labourer in the warehouse, and who has to seek equivalent employment. This is an important question. Do the Opposition think there should or should not be discrimination?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lee</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has not followed my argument, but I will come later to the point which he makes. He was referring to the point made by several of my hon. Friends as to the bodies with whom one should negotiate. I was not deploying that argument, but was pointing out to hon. Members opposite that they have put themselves in this position and that, without having the slightest knowledge of how much this scheme will cost them, they have, nevertheless, on behalf of a Government which is constantly telling us of the need for economies of all kinds, given <i>carte blanche</i> to the payment of £x without knowing how much that amount may be.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
What are the implications of the gratuity to be paid? I know of certain gratuities given in some industries which permanently bring to an end the association of the person receiving those gratuities with any phase of that industry. He may not open out in business in the industry and he ceases to have any future in the industry if there are developments within it which could employ people of his skill and experience. May we be assured by the Minister that no person now employed by the Commission will, by accepting these gratuities, render themselves outside the scope of future employment in connection with the purchase of raw cotton? It is most important that we should have on record a statement from the Minister to that effect.<br><br>
I will now turn to part of the issue raised by the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Shepherd). I have never known any trade union which would agree to allow a branch of its members to complete an agreement with Government Departments or with a Commission of this type without that agreement having been submitted to its executive council for approval and final sanction.<br><br>
Can the Minister tell us that if this scheme is accepted we may deem it to have received the approval of the executive of the association concerned and that there will at no time be any "come back," with the argument which I can well imagine a national executive of an association advancing? They might well say, "Look, we have no knowledge of this, nor have we ever accepted the final payment. This is a Government scheme and has never been accepted on behalf of our members by our Association." Has the Minister fortified himself with a copy of their rules? Does he know whether the branch is allowed this autonomy? Can he assure the Committee that at no date in the future will there be a "comeback" because the scheme has never received the authentic approval of the executive of the union concerned?<br><br>
Much has been said of the differences between compensation for the monthly-paid staff and compensation for the weekly-paid staff. I agree with all that my right hon. Friend the Member for Huyton (Mr. H. Wilson) said on this issue. If we look a little more closely at the scheme we also see that the position of the weekly paid staff deteriorates
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
as time passes. For the monthly paid staff there is to be a lump sum of two months' salary for the first complete year of service with the Commission, plus one month's salary for each additional complete year's service.<br><br>
Over a period of three years it means that they will receive four months' salary. Over the same period the weekly-paid staff will receive only four weeks' pay, so that as a reward for length of service the weekly-paid staff will fall correspondingly further behind the monthly-paid staff the longer and the more faithful their service has been to the Commission. I should have thought that any trade union worker would throw out such a scheme with complete contempt.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us whether he or his colleagues feel that they have been charitable in that they have not informed the weekly paid staff that in fact they are an hourly paid staff and their compensation could be computed on an hourly basis, meaning that they were due to only two hours' pay instead of two weeks' pay? Thank Heaven that point has not been appreciated or we might well have had an hourly staff being given two hours' compensation instead of two weeks' compensation.<br><br>
The Government have already accepted the principle of equal pay for equal work. What a peculiar way of implementing that principle! Not only do they refuse to implement it as between males and females—and I will not go into that argument now—but they refuse point blank to tell us why one person who has served the Commission faithfully and well should be regarded as worth only two weeks at the salary paid when he was employed whereas another person is said to be worth a sum corresponding to two months at the salary which he was receiving?<br><br>
Generally speaking, during employment, the monthly paid staff have all sorts of advantages which are not enjoyed by the weekly paid staff. Generally speaking, a person employed on a monthly basis does not lose remuneration if he is away from work because of illness; he still receives his full cheque at the end of the month. If the weekly paid employee is ill, his pay stops for the period while he is not at work. I therefore regard it as disgraceful that people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
who have had the worse end of the stick during their period of employment with the Commission should, at the end of their employment, find that their services are far less appreciated than those of people who have had much better terms of employment with the Commission.<br><br>
What will be the position if any of these men are unable to find employment? We have heard from both sides of the Committee—indeed, the Minister of State said this himself a little while ago—that when men reach a certain age they find it increasingly difficult to obtain employment. What happens if the former employees of the Cotton Commission, who are to receive the gratuity or benefits under this scheme, are unable to obtain employment? Will the gratuities which they receive be taken into account when they sign on for unemployment benefit or if they are sufficiently unfortunate as to run out of their unemployment benefit and, because of the action of the Government in limiting the period of benefits, have to apply to the National Assistance Board? I am very suspicious that if such a situation should unfortunately arise, and if any ex-employee of the Raw Cotton Commission has to apply for such benefits, he will be told that the benefits which we are now discussing must be taken into account and debited against any payments to which otherwise he would be entitled.<br><br>
These, I submit, are vitally important considerations. Mr. Thomas, in the City which you have the honour so adequately to represent in the House, there was a demonstration on this very issue not many months ago. I should have thought the Government would have taken heed of the feelings of the people on such issues as this.<br><br>
I do not pretend to know the answers but the Minister of State should know them before he attempts to gag us. He should know, and certainly every hon. Member on this side of the Committee knows, that the trade unions in the cotton industry are at present meeting the employers because of their anxiety about the future employment of their members—an anxiety which arises because of this Bill. The terms of reference under which they are meeting are approximately that, because of the action of the Government and the limited cotton supplies which are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
available, we feel that it is highly possible—I put it no higher—that there will be unemployment among our members working in the cotton industry.<br><br>
That is the atmosphere in the cotton industry at the moment. Those negotiations are taking place. In other words, the trade union leaders are saying, "The Government having been responsible for creating unemployment among our members in cotton, the trade unions must ask the employers, who have joined with the Government in their action, to give us a guarantee that in the event of unemployment our members shall receive their weekly wage." Contrast that with the disgraceful so-called benefits contained in this scheme. The trade unions are so worried about the situation which the Government have deliberately and artificially created that they are demanding full payment of a weekly wage no matter how long may be the period of employment of their members in the industry—throughout the whole period their members are unemployed.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I submit to the Committee that, when we are considering the compensation aspects of redundancy among the employees of the Commission, we should take into consideration the climate in the industry, to which I have just made reference, before we agree that compensation on the scale we are now discussing is in any way adequate to meet the critical situation, as it might well prove, that is now arising in the Lancashire cotton industry.<br><br>
The Government have shown us, by the speech of the Minister of State today, first, that if there has been any negotiations at all, which I am now beginning to doubt following the disclosures of my hon. Friend the Member for Droylsden (Mr. W. R. Williams), those negotiations have taken place with a relatively few people representing at least only a portion of those persons whose welfare we are now discussing. The Minister of State practically confessed that there has been no attempt to reach a broad agreement with the labour employed by the Commission or with the <i>bona fide</i> trade unions which might have members employed by the Raw Cotton Commission. These trade unions are not even aware of the composition of this paper which we now have before us.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman think that the trade union representatives on the Raw Cotton Commission could be relied upon to take care of the aspect with which he is now dealing and make sure that whatever was required did, in fact, take place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lee</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept any such onus. So far as I am concerned, I place the responsibility squarely on this Government, because they have broken the organisation of the Raw Cotton Commission, and, by doing so, have wilfully and deliberately brought about a situation in which redundancy is inevitable.<br><br>
I am an Opposition Member of this Committee, and I do not know anything of the negotiations in which the Government considered it right to take part except such information as Ministers of the Crown have given me. I listened the other day to the President of the Board of Trade, who attempted to tell the Committee that sweet reasonableness had prevailed, that the members of the Commission were tumbling over each other to grab the fantastic benefits now to be placed at their disposal through the magnanimity of this Government, whereas we, with some little knowledge of what takes place in industry, and without imputing unworthy motives to the President of the Board of Trade, feel it necessary to ensure that full and adequate representation of all employees was present when these discussions took place, that they took place in an atmosphere of cordiality, and that there was no duress placed upon the employees to accept a certain set of figures in the spirit of "like it or lump it."<br><br>
The Minister of State today, with his usual honesty and candour, made a speech which has shown us that there was not adequate representation of all those various types of employees within the Raw Cotton Commission whom we contend should have been represented. The terms of this arrangement are so inadequate to the weekly paid staff that, as they progress through the years, they will become less and less adequate and less comparable with those offered to the monthly paid staff. I am in no way trying to make a case against the monthly paid staff obtaining at least these benefits.<br><br>
For my part, I would be prepared to argue that they are entitled to even more, especially on the point that their com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
pensation is progressively reduced the longer they have served the Commission. I should have thought that that was a bad thing, and that, where we have a three year period, we should increase the compensation correspondingly for each full year's service in the employ of the Commission. This paper goes in precisely the opposite direction, and these are points which arise in the minds of those who have had much to do with negotiations in industry.<br><br>
Therefore, I put it to the Committee, even at this stage, that it is utterly wrong to rest the final argument in this matter on a document of the cost of which no hon. Member of the Committee or even of the House itself can have any idea, because neither the President of the Board of Trade nor the Minister of State can give us any lead as to what it is. These are the sort of considerations which must guide all hon. Members of the Committee before they dare appear before their constituents as having consented to this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. T. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago, the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Shepherd) put forward the argument by way of implication—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not heard what I am going to say, but, if he claims the gift of second sight, I will give way to him, If he is a prophet, I will give way to him at once.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely wanted to correct the hon. Gentleman. I was not putting forward any argument or expressing any personal opinion, but I was saying that, in view of the representations made by the other side, they ought to declare where they stood on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to put my question to my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Lee), in view of the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Cheadle that men in the executive groups on monthly contracts of service would find it relatively more difficult to secure alternative employment than would those people who were weekly wage earners. Surely, the point having been raised, I am entitled to ask whether it is not a fact, from the information already given to this Committee, that some of the higher
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V001P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
executives of the Commission—and we do not regret it, but are rather pleased about it—have already been successful in being re-absorbed into the cotton industry at executive levels comparable with their experience? Surely, if that is the case, it strengthens the argument put by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton that there ought to he better consideration, relatively, for the weekly wage earners, some of whom will find it very difficult to get suitable employment at the present time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lee</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. Indeed, I was trying to show that, where we have an industry which, unfortunately, as has happened over the years, strikes bad times, which cannot 'be attributed either to any particular Government or series of employers, that is one thing, and we are now more fortified by our economic policy to prevent that, though, nevertheless, it might happen. One of the tests was that the compensation aspect, no matter what the grade of employee may be, should Abe conditioned by a sort of artificially created slump.<br><br>
Here I am arguing that there was not the slightest need for a single one of the people whose welfare we are discussing today to be unemployed at all, whether they be on the monthly paid staff or on the weekly paid staff. There was no need for any of them to come under consideration by this Committee, and it is purely because of the action of the right hon. Gentleman and his friends that the compensation aspect must be taken into consideration.<br><br>
I should have thought that, where we have an industry which is peculiar to itself and in which men cannot move from one Raw Cotton Commission to another—because the Government will see that they are not allowed to do that—and where they cannot move from one comparable employer to another, that situation must be taken into account, especially when we are dealing with men who are now past their youth, many of whom acquired their experience in many years of service to the industry. It is certainly not possible for them to move freely about from one employer to another.<br><br>
For all these reasons, I should have thought that, whatever one thinks about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
the actual wording of certain Amendments which we discussed some time ago—and I do not tie myself rigorously to any particular words—in a Committee including a majority of hon. Members who a short time ago were very concerned about the pension rights of certain retired officers who are now placed in a rather unfortunate position, it is entirely inconsistent for hon. Members opposite—who created quite a scene and informed the Government that they might find it necessary to vote against their legislation in future because of the principle contained in the question of pensions for retired military officers—now to be content and to give their consent to this proposal. We assume that to be so from the fact that not one of those hon. Members has sought the opportunity to address the Committee on this important aspect.<br><br>
I take it that all of them representing cotton constituencies are, in fact, saying to their constituents that they, representing many of these unfortunate people in this House, are not interested any further than the proposals contained in this paper, or about their future welfare, but that they believed that they had had a square deal, irrespective of the fact that they had never been consulted as to whether those concerned believed the compensation to be adequate or not. That indeed is what hon. Members opposite are saying. I know that there will be other occasions upon which we shall have the opportunity of discussing this matter again, and that when the Bill goes back to the House there will be an opportunity for us to raise the matter on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Barlow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Lee) suggests that we shall have an opportunity of raising this issue again. Before he does raise this question of compensation on the Floor of the House, may I suggest that he should read what took place in the Committee stage of the Cotton Bill on 11th March, 1947, when we put forward a new Clause providing for compensation for loss of office, and when very long speeches were made by hon. Members opposite, including the hon. Member for the Exchange Division of Liverpool (Mrs. Braddock) pointing out at great lengths why no compensation at all should be given for that purpose?</span></p>
