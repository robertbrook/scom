<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment proposes to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of Sub-section (1) The Amendment as hon. Members must realise raises a main issue and therefore I hope that in discussing it, I may not be trammelled by too close limitations. This is one of the big issues in connection with this Measure which is disturbing traders in the country generally. I have read carefully the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill and I may remark, incidentally, that while hon. Members were busy in the House of Commons dealing with the national issue which arises here in this connection, I was in the chair at an International Conference in Paris dealing with international issues arising on exactly the same question. It is rather interesting to realise that, in many respects, exactly the same points arise in connection with this matter in the international and in the national sense and that on a large number of these points, the international mind has come into line with our national mind.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
I do not say that we should feel either supported or hindered by international views in dealing with our own national issue, but it is important to realise that other peoples have the same troubles as we have, and are trying to deal with them in much the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue before us presents itself in four different ways. First, there is the question of a complete monopoly of the whole transport of the country. I think we may pass from that consideration. Second, there is the question of the monopoly of road transport and the rail transport. That is bound, ultimately, to end in an agreed monopoly between all concerned. Only two other alternatives are visible. There is the alternative of full and free opportunities of competition, which, as we know by experience, has already destroyed a great deal, and is likely to destroy more of what is really part of our permanent system of transport. It is most important, therefore, that the country should realise that what we must have is controlled competition on reasonable terms, so as to make available to the public the very best service in transport of all kinds, without sacrificing the interests of the country, in any direction. One realises that, on the whole, every effort has been made by those responsible for this Bill, to meet the issues involved. Many of us who have Amendments to move in this Committee will do so first with the desire to elucidate the difficulties, and arrive at an understanding of the questions which are before us, and, secondly, with the desire to deal with what seem to us, real hindrances in an otherwise admirable Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by this Amendment is one which, I feel sure, the Minister and the Committee would not wish to pass over quickly. We are dealing here with a very large proportion of the goods vehicles of the country. I understand that the goods vehicles number between 360,000 and 400,000, and, of that number, some 250,000 to 275,000 are private goods vehicles—engaged in what is called on the Continent 	<i>werkverkehr</i>—dealing with special interests and carrying goods in connection with their own industries. The whole issue is, as to how far it is necessary to involve these private traders in the system of inquiries, and so forth, proposed by the Bill. These traders
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
have a large, interest in the industry and trade of the country, and are only using these vehicles, as I say, in connection with their industries. What we have to consider is, are they to be brought into the malestrom of inquiries and difficulties of various kinds, which necessarily arise out of an endeavour to control competition in a proper manner?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This particular set of vehicles which I have indicated is obviously in a special position, and I recognise that the Minister, in drawing up the Bill, has realised the fact that these vehicles are in a different position from other vehicles, because he has put them into a special class known as the "C" class. In spite of the very clear manner in which he gave his reasons on the Second Reading, many of us do not feel satisfied yet upon this matter, and it is important to have a full discussion in this Committee on the necessity or otherwise of bringing these people into the system of licensing. Surely some arrangement could be devised which would provide more effective power of dealing with these matters under the existing law, which theoretically provides for all that it is necessary to do in these matters. I realise that one of the great difficulties is the question of return loads, which have nothing to do with the business to which the vehicles belong. That matter I understand is to be dealt with, and I think if we consider the question closely we will see that there is an enormous amount in the detailed provisions of the Bill which is quite unnecessary in connection with vehicles of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I daresay that the Minister will tell us that he considers these inquiries, and so forth, necessary in connection with these vehicles. I do not suppose that he wishes, deliberately, to expose these traders to unnecessary interference. But it does not seem desirable to those of us who represent business interests, that there should be, on a question of this kind, investigations into arrangements and contracts and so forth made in the conduct of business affairs. The less a Government interferes with our private affairs in trade, the better for us and the better for the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do you ask for so much assistance from the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear the hon. Member's interruption, but I do not suppose that it was relevant to what I was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to be insulting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I will not take it from you or from anybody in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this connection, among other matters, one notices that agriculture is being specially treated. I should like to be told, if the claims of agriculture are being considered, why the trade of the country should not have some consideration, in this respect. I feel that it is very important before we go any further, to have a full and free discussion of this point so that the Minister may realise the strength of the feeling which exists in trade circles at present, in regard to these matters. I take it we shall hear from the Minister as to how far the investigations which are being called for in regard to the other two classes of licences are to be required in the case of this licence. I take it that he will explain why he considers it necessary to have this licence at all in view of the fact that the Road Transport Act is quite clear in dealing with such points as maintenance of vehicles, speed limits, load limits, and hours of duty. I should also like to ask the Minister why, the Royal Commission on Transport having recommended leaving out these vehicles, he has felt it necessary to bring them into the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, I move the Amendment in order to have further elucidation of the motives of this proposal; to have a definite explanation of why it is considered necessary to use this method, and also to find out how far these investigations into the private affairs of traders are going to be carried. Hon. Members associated with me may have other points
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
to raise but I wish to put to the Minister the difficulties and the interference with trade involved, the fact that these vehicles are already required to have licences and that there are regulations in existence to deal with them, even if these are not wholly effective at the moment. I submit that at present it would be better to deal with them under the existing law, and to strengthen that law, rather than to institute this new system with all its obligations and complications which are disturbing and alarming a trade which is of material value to the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir GERVAIS RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment which, as my hon. Friend the Mover has pointed out, raises one of the most important principles that will have to be considered in connection with this Bill. The Minister, I understand, attaches great importance to these "C" licences but he will not deny that they impose a very substantial additional burden on the road industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman that it must be so, when one considers the enormous number of vehicles to which these "C" licences will apply. If, as I suggest, it means a substantial additional burden to an important and growing industry, the onus rests on the Government to show an overwhelming case in support of their proposal, a case that will outweigh the disadvantages which are obvious, and which, indeed, leap to the eye when one considers this matter. I suggest that it does mean a substantial burden, if we only consider the number of vehicles involved. According to the figures supplied to me, the "C" licence will apply to 275,000 vehicles out of 370,000 vehicles used for carrying goods on the road. It will apply to three out of four vehicles used for the transport of goods and I fail to appreciate how anyone can suggest that that is not a very important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every manufacturer and trader who uses a vehicle for his own business, will have to obtain this additional licence. He will have to make formal application in the first place, to the Traffic Commissioner. He will have to supply full par-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
ticulars, not only of the vehicle itself, but of the business in which it is to be used. The Traffic Commissioner, on the other hand, is not allowed to refuse the licence, but is entitled to attach conditions, and the Minister gives great importance to the imposition of those conditions. If the conditions are not observed, the licence can be revoked and a heavy fine imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely all that must mean a heavy burden and therefore a hindrance to the development of trade and industry in this country. It must mean a substantial addition to the Government staff, because they will have to deal with more than 270,000 applications for those new licences, and, so far as one can see, there is really no practical purpose to be served at all. I am not quite clear as to exactly what particulars will be required from anyone applying for a "C" licence, but I rather fear this may be the beginning of a new form of inquisition of an altogether unreasonable kind. I submit, further, that this "C" licence is unnecessary because, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, all the obligations that one could imagine being attached to such a licence are already provided for under existing legislation. What are those conditions? The first, no doubt, would be to maintain the vehicle in a fit and serviceable state. That is very necessary, but there are existing regulations under the Road Traffic Act, passed only three years ago, for that very purpose. If it is said they are not observed that seems to me an argument for a more strict enforcement of existing legislation, and not an argument for scrapping it and saying there must be a new Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second condition one imagines being imposed would be to observe the speed limit. The First Schedule of the Road Traffic Act deals with that, laying down different speeds for different types of vehicles, and fixing heavy penalties for their infringement. There is difficulty in enforcing those speed limits, and therefore this new method is desired. Then there are the hours of duty of the driver. That point is already provided for under the Road Traffic Act. When that Act was passing through the House of Commons we had hours and hours of discussion on all these matters, and are we really to be told, after only two or three years, that those discussions were to all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
intents and purposes a waste of time because the Act is unenforceable? Finally, there is a provision for the keeping of records of the hours of work and the loads. That is a new provision, and it imposes a heavy burden, and a very strong case ought to be made out in support of it. Already the Minister has felt it necessary—and I am sure we all support the decision—to exempt agricultural vehicles. Surely the same reasons which apply to those vehicles apply to many other vehicles. My hon. Friend has already stressed the fact that the Royal Commission definitely reported against any licensing system of this kind for people using their own vehicles on their own business, and, so far as I am aware, we have not yet been told what has induced the Government to depart from the recommendation of a Royal Commission which devoted so much time and thought to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am led to understand that the main reason why the Minister of Transport attaches so much importance to the "C" licence is that the provisions of the Road Traffic Act with regard to speed limits and the like have become a dead letter, or that the Home Office has found that they are very difficult to enforce, and therefore it is desired to achieve the same object by this new system of licensing. I feel very apprehensive about that. I do not see how it is going to work. The suggestion is, apparently, made that evidence of a breach of the speed limit is so difficult to obtain that it is difficult to bring cases before the courts in such circumstances as will lead to a conviction, or, alternatively, that magistrates are not sufficiently impressed by the evidence to do more than inflict a small and, may be, inadequate fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being the state of affairs, it is suggested that the difficulty can be got over by imposing a new "C" licence on so many of these vehicles. How is that licence going to be granted or revoked? A magistrate finds himself unable on the evidence to convict, or does not think the case worthy of anything more than what is regarded as an insufficient penalty, yet a licensing committee, months afterwards, it may be, is to re-try the case, as it were, on hearsay evidence, and impose a penalty which in some cases may involve the loss of a man's livelihood.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
It seems to me that is a risk to which people should not be subject, that no clear case has been made out for this new licence, and that this legislation has in it inherent dangers and difficulties. Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting this Amendment, and I hope the Minister will give us a much fuller and clearer explanation of why this licence is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOVAT-FRASER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to oppose the Amendment. As my hon. Friend who has just spoken has said, 70 per cent. of the motor vehicles on the roads are there for ancillary purposes. If this Amendment is adopted, the possessors of the class of motor vehicles included in Class "C" will escape the observance of the law. There is an immense amount of violation of the law by vehicles of that class at the present time, and there are no means of punishing consistent infringements of the law. This Clause is absolutely essential to ensure the safety of the roads. The number of casualties due to goods vehicles is steadily increasing. The total number of casualties due to mechanically-propelled vehicles in 1929 was 177,000, or 10 per cent. of the casualties; in 1930, 185,000, or 11 per cent.; in 1931, 208,000, or 12 per cent., and in 1932, 213,000, or 13 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GUY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are those the figures for road haulage vehicles, or all motor vehicles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOVAT-FRASER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mechanically-propelled vehicles. I have here a large number of cases of violation of the law. They have been handed to me, and I have not had the opportunity of going through them in detail, but I would like to give two instances of the kind of thing which I hope will be prevented by this Clause. In one case it is stated that a motor driver named Irons of Stockton-on-Tees appeared at Doncaster Court on a summons which alleged that he exceeded the speed limit of 30 miles per hour, in a motor van which was stated to have contained 4,000 lbs. of high explosive. Police evidence was given that the man drove at 45 miles per hour. If a collision had occurred the consequences would have been disastrous. Irons said that the explosive was T.N.T. and would not explode unless detonated. He had to cover 390 miles in a day and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
had told the works' manager that it was impossible to do so without breaking the limit. Here is another case, headed "An inhuman employer":
	<br><q><p>"Trent Oil Products, Limited, of Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, had been summoned for allowing a driver to work 43 hours without rest. The man fell asleep from sheer fatigue and his lorry ran into a river. His wages were 55s. a week. The magistrates fined the firm the maximum penalty of £20, and regretted that it was not more."</p></q>
If there is one Clause in this Bill which ought to be passed, it is this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir HENRY CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this Bill, and particularly this Clause. As a Chairman of Quarter Sessions who spends time one day a week in keeping the Brighton road in order, I tell the Committee that the greatest danger is caused by these vans careering about crowded roads such as the Brighton road at a speed which varies from about 30 to 50 miles an hour. My county of East Sussex is pretty well the only one which does make some effort to work the Road Traffic Act as to speed limits, conditions of labour, that is, the hours of the men engaged in driving these vehicles, and the other conditions which have to be complied with. Our experience is that the law is totally inadequate to deal with offenders. We can only fine a man, and have no power to revoke his licence, and this Bill does provide a remedy in that respect. The only way in which we can control motor traffic at all is by power given to the courts to suspend licences. I say that after years and years of experience. There is no greater danger on the roads than these heavy vehicles—and even light vans. It is the ordinary tradesman's van, which is often driven by a young man, going at these very rapid speeds, which does so much damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other offence of excessive loading is almost impossible to detect under the existing law. Clause 16 of the Bill will provide, by means of examiners and the powers given to police constables, some machinery which will enable a check to be put on excessive loading of these vehicles, and will ensure that the law is complied with. Only early this spring I ordered about six tons of fertiliser, and it arrived on a three-ton motor lorry; and universally the licence laws are contravened by the excessive loading of lorries which are licensed for a certain weight.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
It is more particularly in regard to the danger of these enormous weights, and the powers given to check them, that I welcome the Bill. I can imagine no greater danger than the rapid speed of heavily laden motor wagons carrying from six to 10 tons such as are careering about our roads. If such a vehicle hits anything, it causes very serious damage indeed. It is essential that all motor vehicles carrying goods should be brought under the Bill, and I approve of the different classes of licences which are provided. The man who obeys the law has nothing to fear. I strongly support the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main argument which has been put forward against the Amendment up to now, has been that it is not possible under the existing law sufficiently to punish offenders against the regulations as to speed, loading, and hours of duty. The hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Lovat-Fraser) said that the real necessity for the Bill was to ensure that people should not escape the observance of the law, and he immediately proceeded to read out several cases and held up a sheaf of newspaper cuttings of reports of convictions which had been recorded. Then the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), speaking in his capacity as Chairman of Quarter Sessions, stated how many people he convicts from time to time in that capacity. How, then, can it be alleged that offenders are escaping? What more is wanted than the penalties which are already provided under the various enactments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. and learned Friend has pointed out, under the Road Traffic Act, 1930, there is a penalty of £20 for not maintaining a vehicle in proper order. Is it suggested that that is not a severe penalty? Under the same Act there is a maximum penalty, for the first offence, of £50 for not complying with the speed limits, and a second offence is punishable by a fine of £100 or imprisonment. I would again ask, what more do my hon. friends want? Surely, they are not so bloodthirsty as to desire that all these offenders should be placed in prison for a first offence? Power is given under the existing law to inflict imprisonment for a second offence, not only against the speed limit, but also for an infringement of the regulations as to hours of duty. I suggest that sufficient penalties can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
already be imposed under the existing law, and that to desire that all vehicles owned by private firms should be licensed under the "C" licence proposed in the Bill is rather absurd. I would ask the Committee to consider what is really meant by these provisions as to "C" licences. It has been pointed out that about 275,000 vehicles will come under these regulations, and the Committee will remember that the Royal Commission on Transport definitely recommended that there should be no compulsion to license the vehicles of private concerns using their vehicles for their own haulage. I would ask the Committee to have regard to the reasons which caused the Royal Commission to come to that decision. The hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead spoke in his capacity as Chairman of Quarter Sessions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only from the experience that I gained in that capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put a different point of view to the Committee. It is because of my particular experience that I am supporting the Amendment, and opposing the regulations as to "C" licences. I want the Committee to know definitely where I stand here. On the Second Reading I made it clear that I did not like the Bill. I do not like it, and it will be noticed that my name is down to a considerable number of Amendments. But I want to make it clear now that those are not obstructionist Amendments, but are merely put down for the purpose of trying to amend the Bill having regard to my experience in these matters. I may explain that I am a practising solicitor, and have had to attend the commissioners' courts very frequently in cases under the Road Traffic Act, 1930, and I know from experience the intolerable burden that is imposed upon the owners of public service vehicles. I have known owner after owner of public service vehicles go out of business because of the intolerable burden imposed by the provisions of the Act of 1930. More than that, they are called upon to attend the court, they have to employ lawyers, and they are opposed by lawyers. It may be said that I am using arguments inimical to the interests of my profession, but at any rate I think the Committee are entitled to have views put forward based on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
actual experience of the working of the Act of 1930.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the compulsory licensing of 275,000 vehicles under these provisions will serve no useful purpose, but will be a hindrance to industry without any compensating advantages. It may be that the intention of the Minister is not to impose these intolerable burdens, but, after the Bill is passed, it will depend upon the interpretation placed upon these provisions by the Traffic Commissioners of the various areas and by the police, and those of us who have experience of the actual working of the law know that there may be a very wide difference between the intention of the Minister and of this committee and the actual working of the Act in practice. I hope the Committee will consider very carefully before making the regulations as to "C" licences compulsory upon the owners of private vehicles. I reiterate that that will put upon these people an intolerable burden which they should not be called upon to bear, having regard to the state of trade and industry to-day. For these reasons I support the Amendment, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GEORGE HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my colleagues here, I would ask the Minister to resist this Amendment. We think that it strikes at the root of the Bill. I think the case against it was put by the hon. Member who moved it when he said that, of the 375,000 motor goods vehicles on the roads, some 275,000 are privately owned. If this Amendment were carried, and the 275,000 vehicles referred to were exempted from the provisions of the Bill, there would be left 100,000 goods vehicles coming under the Act when it is passed. We agree that every vehicle should be licensed, and we take our stand upon that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to hear the suggestions about the exacting particulars which are to be given by the owners of these vehicles. I think the Minister made the position clear on the Second Reading. He referred specially to the "C" licences, and said that the application for such a licence would be made to the Traffic Commissioner of the area in which the applicant's principal place of business was situated; and he went on to say:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
	<br><q><p>"All he has to do is to send in to the commissioner particulars of the number of vehicles for which he wishes a licence. There need not be any publication of his application, there is no inquiry, and no opportunity for objection. There is no discretion for the traffic commissioner to refuse a licence."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 3rd May 1933; cols. 864–5, Vol. 277.]</p></q>
All that is expected under the Bill from the private owner of a vehicle of this kind, as far as a "C" licence is concerned, is that, when the licence is granted, it shall have attached to it all those security conditions which are obligatory in the case of "A" and "B" licences. Is there any objection to attaching the same security conditions to all goods vehicles on the roads? We on this side say that these security conditions should be attached to every vehicle, irrespective of who owns it, and we think that that is reasonable. We do not want to take up very much of the time of the Committee, but, as far as we can see, if this Amendment is carried, it will destroy the whole purpose of the Bill, and we shall oppose the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LESLIE BOYCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also wish to support the hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. G. Hall) in requesting the Minister not to accept this Amendment, and I hope that the Committee, if it is put to the vote, will reject it by a large majority. The Amendment is inconsistent with the whole scheme of licensing proposed in the Bill; it goes to the very root of the Measure. The effect of the Amendment would be to exclude all persons who operate goods motor vehicles in connection with their own business from the necessity of obtaining a licence. We have heard this morning, particularly from the hon. and learned Member for Lowestoft (Sir G. Rentoul), that the number of vehicles comprehended in this Amendment is about two-thirds of the whole of the goods motor vehicles running in this country at the present time. I do not know where my hon. and learned Friend got those figures, and it is, perhaps, immaterial, but the total number of goods motor vehicles licensed in the quarter ending September, 1932, was 370,000, and the Salter Report stated that some 75 per cent. of that number were ancillary users' vehicles. I suppose that, if we make due allowance for that proportion of these vehicles which are used partly for the conveyance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
of goods for hire or reward, and which under the Bill would have to be operated under "B" licences, the actual number affected by the Amendment would probably be, on a conservative basis, somewhere in the region of the figure of 275,000 which has been stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Amendment is carried, the whole of the 275,000 will be entirely exempted from the provisions of the Bill and the Bill will hardly be worth the paper that it is printed on. I hope that we are going to have the same principle applying to all goods road vehicles so far as security conditions are concerned, whether they are licensed under an "A," "B," or "C" licence. As the Bill stands at present, and as we have been told, these vehicles would have a "C" licence. My hon. Friend the Member for the West Derby Division of Liverpool (Sir J. Sandeman Allen) said that the conditions of obtaining this licence were onerous. They could not be more simple. They cannot be regarded in any sense as onerous or restrictive. In fact, the licence is to be granted on the mere formality of filling up and handing in a prescribed form. It entails no inconvenience to the applicant whatever. Moreover, no conditions under this Bill can attach to a "C" licence in any way to restrict the use of the vehicles in connection with the owner's or the operator's business. Furthermore, no one has the right, under this Bill, to object to the granting of the licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that it is very important that this Amendment should be rejected, and that these vehicles should be licensed because, under the licensing scheme of the Bill, all goods road vehicles are properly subjected to the conditions of Clause 8, Sub-section (1). These conditions are those which have been referred to as the security conditions. What are those conditions? The hon. and learned Member for Lowestoft (Sir G. Rentoul) has referred to them this morning in a very hesitating way. They are four, and four only, in number. The first is that the vehicles should be maintained in a fit and serviceable condition. Who in the world—in this Committee at all events—would object to that? The second is that the provision relating to limits of speed and of loading should be complied with. It is well within the knowledge of the Committee, and it is notorious outside the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
House, that the conditions relating to limits of speed and of loading are not being complied with. It is futile for hon. Members to stand up here and say that the law already prescribes these conditions. There was a time, before the long Recess of last year, and just before the Salter Conference was set up, when I had in my possession details of no less than 500 offences of this nature which had not been brought to justice, and which I was proposing to submit at that time to the Minister of Transport, and I would have done so had the Salter Conference not been set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another requirement is that the drivers' hours should be observed. We have had numerous cases which have taken the form of questions in the House drawing the attention of the Minister or the Home Secretary, time and time again, to the fact that drivers have driven for 17 hours or longer without a rest, and that they have gone sometimes with only a few hours' sleep in the course of a week. The provisions of this Bill will enable the law to be administered effectively. The fact that the law exists to-day which forbids these things is one matter, and the fact that when this Bill becomes an Act and the law will be in an effective administrative form, is another thing. The only other requirement attaching to a "C" licence is, that records which are necessary to the proper administration of the Bill should be kept. It is of the greatest public importance that every operator of a goods vehicle should be made to comply with these conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that the law already provides these conditions. At the present time it is well worth a man's while to take the risk of being brought before a court and being fined. [An HON. MEMBER: "£50!"] We are told that the fine is £50. The chances are at least 50 to 1 that the man will not be brought before the court if he exceeds the speed limit or overloads his vehicle, and the chances are probably 500 to 1 that, if he is, he will not be fined more than £5. That is precisely what is happening. We know that it is happening. A man says: "It is worth my while to break the law, on the chance that I will not be caught, and if I am caught the chances of my being fined only a very small sum are favourable." It is in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
public interest that the Committee should reject the Amendment and that these vehicles should be licensed, and that the licensing authority should be given the power to suspend or revoke a licence when necessary in order to enforce the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that this is going to be a very interesting Committee. This morning we have two sets of lawyers briefed to defend two particular sets of interests. One set are defending the rail, and the others are defending the road. We, on these benches, are representing the workers. We have to do our best, few as we are, against all this array. [An HON. MEMBER: "Rubbish!"] I agree that largely it is rubbish. We have them here, stating a case against this Amendment and for the Amendment, not in the interests of the community, but in the interests of the personal interest that they have. We have heard the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. McKeag) say that we have suffered harshly by the Road Traffic Act because it put a number of small firms out of business. Yes, that is quite true, and we did all that we could to put them out of business, the reason being that we found that when poor people got injured by the omnibuses belonging to these small firms and had a good claim at law for damages, those small firms went out of business scientifically, advised again by the lawyers, who told them that that was a way out. We had to vote them out of business to the best of our ability. We are not going to put back the hands of the clock to suit either the rail or the road, but we are going to take the best from both methods of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have the Committee bear in mind that it has been said several times that 75 per cent. of the vehicles on the road are going to be affected by "C" licences. Who is included in that 75 per cent.? I expected to hear the usual tale trotted out about the poor widow and orphan. [An HON. MEMBER: "That is your policy!"] No fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have the copyright of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have never whined. It has always been the ruling-class of this country that has whined,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
and whined to the workers. I expected that they would have come out and played up to the Committee, to the Minister of Transport, and to the agricultural tradition by saying that this was going to hit the farmer, that the farmer's vehicle was going to be a hindrance to him and that if we passed this Clause as it is in the Bill it would again be a blow to agriculture. I am glad that we are making some progress, because they have not trotted those things out. Those arguments are bone-dry. There is something of which the Committee had better be aware. The person who will be affected will not be the small business man, but it will be Harrods and Lyons, and firms like those, who will benefit, if this Amendment is accepted. I hope that the Minister will resist this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will pardon me if I recall their attention for a moment to the Amendment which we are discussing. I would make this sole reference to what has been said by the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood). He made a statement that the Labour party had never whined, and I felt that he ought to draw the attention of one of his colleagues, the hon. Member for West Bermondsey (Dr. Salter), to that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that condemnation is merited at this time, because you cannot condemn a party for the failing of one individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment which we are now discussing is probably the most important Amendment which will be moved during the course of these Debates. It is quite true, as several hon. Members have said, that if this Amendment were accepted by the Committee it would completely destroy at least one of the purposes of the Bill, and that is the additional security of the public. When we are discussing an Amendment of such importance, we should clear our speeches of vague generalities and exaggeration, and get down to the actual facts of the case. I am told by hon. Members that the obligation to take out a "C" licence is going to impose an intolerable burden upon the owners of these vehicles, that it is going to land them in a maelstrom of inquiry and that nobody can deny that it is going to be a very substantial
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
hindrance to their trade. I should just like to consider what will be the actual results of this "C" licence, and I should like to ask hon. Members how it could possibly be said that this constitutes an intolerable burden. It is idle to say that it must be an intolerable burden because it applies to 270,000 vehicles. We have to consider the burden that it puts upon the individual in the case of each separate vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, with regard to the application. An application has only to be made once every three years. It is quite untrue to say that when you make the application you have to support it with a number of particulars. The hon. and learned Member for Lowestoft (Sir G. Rentoul) said that you would have to tell the commissioners what you were going to use the vehicle for. That, of course, is quite inaccurate. You have to tell the number and the type of vehicles that you want to use. I do not think that anyone can suggest that to have to send in to the commissioners once every three years an application, stating the number of vehicles and the type, constitutes an intolerable burden upon anyone. It is true that, as the Bill stands, there is a possibility of inquiries being made, but they are not particulars that have to be given by the applicants except in as much as they are demanded by the licensing authority. The object of giving that power to the licensing authority is simply to prevent cases of evasion and so that where there is reason to suspect that applications are being disguised by some kind of arrangement, they should be in a position to make full inquiry. I see that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Mr. Aled Roberts) has some Amendments down which I think will simplify the position, and which I am disposed to accept. So much for the burden of the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now for the cost. Although it has been said outside that this is going to impose an intolerable financial burden upon applicants, I notice that nobody in this Committee, and I am not surprised, has dared to repeat that suggestion. The total estimated cost of the licensing system is £130,000 a year, and that has to be spread over 375,000 vehicles. Even allowing for adjustment with regard to particular licences, in which adjustment the holders of "C" licences will

probably come off best, it cannot be said that the cost of the application is going to be anything more than a few shillings a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman giving the Committee an undertaking that the cost of administering this Bill will not be more than £130,000 a year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am not giving the Committee such an undertaking. I am giving the estimate already in the White Paper, and I say, frankly, that the cost of administering must depend on the efficacy of the limited number of inspectors whom we propose, in the first instance, to appoint to deal with the situation which I am going to detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain STRICKLAND</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that the Minister does not propose to bring the "C" licences within the terms of Clause 5, Sub-section (2)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we had better leave these details until we come to discuss the Clause on which they arise. There are Amendments in the names of some of my hon. Friends which I have not finished considering, but which I am at present disposed to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain STRICKLAND</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would make a great difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, we have dealt with the application and the cost. Once the application is made there is no discretion on the part of the Commissioner to refuse, and the kind of thing about which the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. McKeag) spoke in connection with the Road Traffic Act—the employment of expensive and lengthy lawyers involving clients in difficult and costly hearings—is, of course, impossible in this case. Once the application is made, as I say, there is no discretion on the part of the Commissioner to refuse a licence. When the licence is granted, what burden does it impose on the holder? Simply the observance of the security conditions to which I have made reference. My hon. Friends cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Lowestoft did, that these conditions impose an intolerable burden, and at the same time argue that these conditions are nothing more than the existing law and that there is no need to have them at all. The fact is that anybody who observes the law as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
it stands, will be under no disadvantage because these conditions are attached. With the one exception of the condition as to keeping records, which I shall deal with later, they are conditions which can only prove a burden to those who, so far, have flagrantly ignored the law, and will now be forced to observe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the condition which requires the keeping of records, I do not want to make that a hardship to the trader, and we are prepared to consider any reasonable suggestion for making it work smoothly and easily. But I regard it as essential if these conditions are to be observed. I hope I have disposed of the idea that these licences mean any appreciable burden upon those who will have to take them up. It is still incumbent upon me, however, to prove to the Committee that there is a real advantage in them. It is not enough to say that they will not hurt anybody. We have to prove that this provision is going to do some good. I do not think that after the speech of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), it is necessary to labour that point. Here we have a man, speaking from experience, who has tried to administer the provisions of the Act of 1930, with which none of us disagree. We all agree with those provisions, but my hon. and learned Friend, who has the best reason for knowing whether they can or cannot be enforced, tells us that he has tried to enforce them as the law stands, and has found it impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I am asked why the Royal Commission did not recommend the inclusion of these people in the licences, I would point out that the Royal Commission reported in 1930 when the Road Traffic Act was still going through Parliament, or at any rate before it had been put into force. No doubt they had in mind the idea that these provisions in the Road Traffic Act could be, and would be, enforced. The experience of the last three years has shown that that was a vague hope, and that the existing provisions are not sufficient to enforce the conditions. I would also point out to hon. Members that at the same time as the 1930 Act laid down conditions for all vehicles, it imposed a system such as this upon some of them, and, with regard to passenger service vehicles, everybody will agree that the licensing system has been sufficient to enforce the conditions.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
We are entitled to argue that a similar system applied to these goods vehicles, will be equally efficient. It is for those reasons that I ask the Committee decisively to reject the Amendment. If carried it would wreck a part of the Bill which many of us regard as most important, because it attempts to deal, as far as goods vehicles, are concerned, with the terrible toll of the road, which has begun to arouse the conscience of the people of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain STRICKLAND</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood), said that this was going to be an extraordinarily interesting Committee. I am inclined, for once, to agree with him. I think it is going to be distinguished by a desire on both sides—for there are two sides—not to approach the consideration of the Bill in any spirit of hostility, but rather in an endeavour to inflict as little hardship as possible upon the industries of the country, and particularly on those smaller men, who in reality cannot be regarded as road hauliers. The fact that the grocer or the milkman is taking round his goods in a motor van is simply a sign of the march of progress and of a new system which has come into our civilisation with great benefit to the community as a whole. It is largely from that point of view that those who feel as my hon. Friends here do with regard to the "C" licences approach this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand, you have an organisation, which is comparable to our railway organisation, in that it caters for a definite trade, apart from what may be called the actual industrial pursuits of the people. That is to say, you have, on the one hand, certain individuals who, like the railways, depend on the carriage of goods, and in my opinion their case is entirely different from the case of those who will be affected if the "C" licences are included in the Bill. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), speaking from experience has quoted cases arising in the administration of the Road Traffic Act. I have in mind this situation. An indictment has been made by the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Boyce), against the police forces and magistrates throughout the country. He says, they have a law to administer which they fail to administer. I do not suppose that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
magistrates throughout the country have some sort of brief as a result of which they are disinclined to carry out the law. The fact of the matter is that in many of these cases, there is a large element of doubt, and the magistrates have to give play to their sense of fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Road Traffic Act has failed through lack of interest on the part of magistrates or police, are we not led to this point of view—that the gentleman who happens to be chairman of the Commissioners is to occupy a judicial position superior to that of our magistrates? That is to say, that whereas magistrates, having evidence before them, cannot find just cause for conviction, the Commissioner, with or without their evidence, is to use his judicial authority to deprive a particular trader of means of transport. That may, of course, in many cases, mean that the trader will have to go back to the old horse-drawn form of transport, which would encumber our roads to an even greater extent than they are encumbered at present. That is an important consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, I cannot fail to be impressed by the reasonable attitude of the Minister. He has said, in effect, that we, as a Committee, are here to improve and not to destroy the Bill, and we have no desire to raise any onerous objections in regard to its administration. The suggestion of the Minister that he is prepared to consider the more serious objections to the "C" licences is one which we accept gratefully and which predisposes us to assist in the passing of the Bill, subject to reasonable consideration being given to such propositions as we submit. All I would emphasise is that the "C" licence people are not road hauliers and are not in competition with the railways or other transport. They are merely carrying out functions for the benefit of the community which used to be done by horse-drawn traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to save them as much trouble as possible, and I suggest that one of the main troubles is going to be the provision as regards the keeping of records. It is almost impossible for small shopkeepers or medium shopkeepers, or even the smaller trades, to keep accurate records of the various small parcels carried under the present system. The fact that these records are supposed to be taken
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
about by the driver, and that the drivers are liable to be held up by inspectors, with consequent loss of time, are considerations which I hope will be dealt with in a fair manner in the course of these proceedings. Those of us who hold the views which I have indicated, are merely anxious at this stage to clarify our position and to make it plain that our attitude is not one of hostility to the Bill, but of endeavouring to improve it and make it of benefit to the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CLEMENT DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree also that this ought to be both a very interesting and a very helpful Committee. It is a Committee which ought to give of its best to assist the Government in carrying through some measure of control of this nature. I am afraid I shall have to apologise to the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) for coming within one of the categories mentioned by him. I am speaking here not on behalf of a railway company or of a road company, but I am afraid that at one time, at any rate, I was a lawyer, and therefore I am subject to the hon. Member's castigation, but I will do my best to forget it. The hon. Member mentioned that possibly there were Members here representing the railways and the roads, and he, in particular, claimed that he was representing the workers. May I suggest to him that he might have looked into the matter a little further and remembered that all of us represent the community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to God it were true!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to persuade the hon. Member before I have finished. In this respect I am very glad that the Minister has resisted this Amendment. What is so often forgotten is that, whether the vehicle using the road is that of a common carrier or is used for the carriage of a person's own goods and other people's goods, it is a public road for which the public have to pay, and, that being so, the Government and the public are entitled to have all vehicles regulated. That point of view has been recognised in all motor car Acts which have ever been passed. Whether those Acts are being enforced the magistrates can say better than I, but I do feel that the Government should take to itself the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
power of regulating all forms of transport, whether they belong to private individuals or public companies acting as public carriers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<i>The following Amendment stood upon the Order Paper in the name of</i> Mr. ALED ROBERTS: In page 2, line 4, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><q><p>"Provided that the carriage of goods bought or sold by the holder of an "A" licence for the purpose of enabling him to carry such goods shall be deemed to be the carriage of goods for or in connection with his business as a carrier of goods."</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ALED ROBERTS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to point out that the Clause seems to presuppose a distinction between the different classes of goods-carrying vehicles which is made clearer in Clause 2, where the exact powers which will be given to vehicle owners are laid down very definitely. There is a class of haulage contractor who, in the ordinary way, would have to have an "A" licence who cannot very well come under either of these two broad definitions in Clause 1. I do not know whether it would be for the convenience of the Committee that I should deal with that point at this moment, or whether it would come better on the Amendment to Clause 2 as to the powers, carrying capacity and carrying rights given to "A" licence holders. I do not mind whether I discuss it now or on Clause 2, as long as I have the right to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would point out to the hon. Member that I do not think his Amendment really reads, and therefore it might be better to raise his point on the subsequent Amendment, which I think would fit in better with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROBERTS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think probably that would be for the greater convenience of the Committee, and therefore I will not move my Amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 6, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><q><p>"Provided that the use of a goods vehicle on a road by a railway company for the purpose of the collection or delivery of goods in connection with the business of the conveyance of goods on their railway shall be deemed to be the carriage of goods for hire or reward."</p></q>
In moving this Amendment I wish to get to know clearly what is intended in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
connection with these licences. Take the case of a railway company. They have ancillary services, but it is all part of their trading for hire, and it seems to me to be essential that we should lay down quite clearly that the motor delivery services of a railway company are part of their trading for hire. This Amendment may not be necessary, but I have brought it forward to see whether it is clear that railway companies, for example, would not be entitled to claim a "C" licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the hon. Member for having given me the opportunity of making this point clear. It is certainly our intention that vehicles of this type will need an "A" licence, and I am advised, after the most careful scrutiny, that the Bill as drafted makes that quite clear. In most cases the whole-rate system is built up of a charge covering both rail and road delivery, and in that case there could be no doubt; but I am advised that even in those exceptional cases where the railways make no charge within what they call a "free delivery area"—there has been a case in the Courts recently on a rather analogous point—that would still be held to include the element of hire and reward and to necessitate the taking out of an "A" licence. I think the hon. Member need have no fear that his point is already met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 13, after the first word "the," to insert the words "collection, carriage, or."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several Amendments to line 13 raising the same general point though differing in detail, and I wonder whether it would be for the general convenience if we had a general discussion on them on this Amendment and took Divisions afterwards, if necessary, on the separate Amendments. I may say that I propose to accept certain of the Amendments to this line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the Minister what he means by a "general discussion"? Does he mean it to cover all the Amendments to this Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, only the Amendments to line 13. I think the next six Amendments all raise more or less the same general subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not facilitate matters if the Minister would state which Amendments he proposes to accept?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We propose to accept the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Conant)—after the word "delivery" to insert the words "or collection"—the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. McKeag)—after the word "sold" to insert the words "or used"—subject to a proviso which I will explain later; and the next Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Chesterfield—after the word "sold" to insert the words "or let on hire or hire purchase." If the Committee agree with that suggestion, the Clause would read:
	<br><q><p>"the delivery or collection by a person of goods sold or used or let on hire or hire purchase in the course of a trade or business carried on by him."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much indebted to the hon. Gentleman for endeavouring to meet those of us who have put down these Amendments. I would have preferred to see paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of Sub-section (3) amended like this:
	<br><q><p>"the collection, carriage or delivery by a person of goods bought, sold or used in the course of a trade or business carried on by him."</p></q>
The Minister explained on Second Reading that it was intended to enable the holder of a "C" licence, a shopkeeper, for instance, to make a charge for delivery of his goods without having to take out a "B" licence, but it is essential to remember that there are many other cases where the primary business of the people who will be making applications is the sale or purchase of goods and where a charge is made for collection and conveyance which are not strictly within the ordinary haulage business. There is the example of an auctioneer who goes to a house to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
collect goods which he afterwards auctions in his auction rooms. No doubt the commission which he charges can strictly be held to include the cost of carriage of those goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point surely would be covered if I accept the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Conant) to add the words "or collection."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister if he will go a step further and accept the word "carriage"? I did not quite hear him when he made his explanation. Does he accept the word "carriage"? We have now got the word "collection" and we have got the words "sold or used." There are only two other words about which there appears to be any question, the word "carriage" and the word "bought." If the hon. Gentleman will go so far as to accept those two words there is no need for me to pursue the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member would go so far as to show me circumstances in which this could arise, I would certainly consider whether or not I could accept his Amendment. My difficulty is at the moment that I do not see the sort of case in which the necessity for the inclusion of these words could be shown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given one instance, which the hon. Gentleman now says is perhaps covered by the word "collection," and I am glad of that assurance, but there is also the case of someone who may be desirous of collecting or delivering, say, a spare part from one depot to another, and has had to make a purchase in the original case, or where he has had to buy it and it is being taken from one depot to another, an additional charge being made for its carriage. It is minor cases of that sort, which do not come strictly within the ordinary haulier's business, that I want to cover by my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CONANT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the Minister for having accepted the Amendments which I have put down to meet the point that I had in mind concerning the position of, say, a local authority owning an electricity undertaking and letting out electric fittings

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Amendments which the Minister is accepting are not circumventing what has been already decided on previous Amendments that we resisted. The Minister is accepting the words "collection" and "use," and the words "collection and carriage" are to be inserted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member will realise that the only effect of these Amendments will be, not that a man will not have to take out a licence at all, but that a man who might otherwise have had to take out an "A" or "B" licence will be entitled to take out a "C" licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that they are on approval or samples does not affect the matter. I think that every case which has been put before us will be covered. The word "carriage" can really add nothing to "collection" or "delivery." A thing that is carried has to be collected from somewhere, and delivered somewhere else. I cannot see any case where a man who has bought goods is likely to make a charge for their collection or delivery. In these circumstances I hope that the Committee will agree to the Amendments which I am prepared to accept, and will reject the other two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 13, after the word "sold," to insert the word "used."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I accept the principle which this word is intended to cover, I shall have to look more closely into the word between now and another stage, and see whether it is necessary to amend it. I understand the class of case that it is intended to cover, and I shall either accept this word or some alternative form of words which will cover the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: In page 2, line 13, after the word last inserted, insert the words "or let on hire or hire purchase."—[	<i>Mr. Conant.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 16, to leave out the words "delivery or collection," and to insert instead thereof the words "collection, carriage or delivery."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this Amendment is to assimilate the language of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). It is submitted that goods subjected to a process may be collected by the firm undertaking the operation, and a charge made for the collection, and the intention of the Amendment is to cover a case of that description.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I do not understand the hon. Member's point as to assimilating this to paragraph (	<i>a</i>). Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) has now been amended so as to read:
	<br><q><p>"the delivery or collection,"</p></q>
so that it is in exactly the same terms as the words which the hon. Member now proposes to amend. I have exactly the same reply to make as when he wished to insert the word "carriage" in the pre-

vious paragraph. It does not seem to me to add anything to the existing words "delivery or collection." In these circumstances, I hope that the Committee will not accept this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue the matter. If the hon.

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 18, after the word "process," to insert the words "or treatment."

The object of the Clause is perfectly clear, and the Minister explained it in his Second Reading speech. The only reason for this Amendment is that it struck some of us that the word "process' only was, perhaps, not sufficient, and that the addition of the words "or treatment" would make the matter clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to put myself in the category to which my hon. Friend has referred, of a wiser man than himself, but I will put in that category the editors of the Oxford Dictionary, where I find that the definition of the verb "to process" is "to subject to or to treat by a special process." I think that my hon. Friend can be assured that the word "process" covers treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain STRICKLAND</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that our friend Webster is rather opposed to the Minister's quotation. Webster says that it is "a series of actions, motions or occurences."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

After what the Minister has just said, I am rather doubtful about moving this Amendment, but the Attorney-General

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
will be able to imagine cases where there is a process, but where it can be said that, while the article is being processed, it is not being dealt with. I can understand that treatment would come under the word "process," but, if there is any doubt, I am sure the Minister will consider the matter again, and, if the word "process" is not wide enough, perhaps some similar word may be added.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the trouble about the words "dealt with" is that they may be too wide. They might cover the mere handling of goods which are being carried from one vehicle to another. I think that we all know what we have in mind when we speak of processing or treatment, and that there is no doubt that the word "process" is broad enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TURTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926, the word "process" was not considered to be sufficient, and the words "blend" and "treatment" were added. Moreover, in the Oxford Dictionary the precise wording is "to treat by a special process." That limits the definition. May I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter before Report, because it seems to me, that if Parliament in its wisdom always uses a limiting word in conjunction with the word "process" in previous Acts, it might be necessary to do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly look into the precedent which my hon. Friend has mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is also the case of goods collected by the owner for the express purpose of being fitted into a vehicle, which may require alteration or reshaping, and I should like to be sure that that case would be covered by the word "process."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is any doubt about that, but I will look into the precedent which has been mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ALED ROBERTS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 20, to leave out paragraph (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
I am sorry that I cannot move this Amendment formally, but shall have to go into some explanation with regard to it. In my view this is a very serious loophole in the Bill. Sub-section (3) of Clause 1 lays down a definition of what is and what is not carriage of goods for hire or reward. In the ordinary way, in most other parts of the Bill, it is clear that the carriage of goods for hire or reward means the carriage of goods for which payment is made, or for which services are exchanged. It is also clear that anybody who accepts carriage of goods for hire or reward has to have either an "A" or a "B" licence. This paragraph deals with persons engaged in agriculture. I know that once you mention anything in connection with agriculture every hon. Member with one or two farmers in 200 square miles of division gets the breeze up well and properly. In this case, there is no need for any hon. Member to start out with a prejudice against the Amendment which I am proposing, for the reason that on the same page of the Bill, and in this Clause, special exceptions are made and very special privileges are granted to vehicles which are defined as agricultural vehicles and which are used for purposes of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If paragraph (	<i>c</i>) is allowed to remain in the Bill, the effect of it will be that any farmer can carry his own goods or the goods of any other farmer, and as long as he is only carrying them for another farmer he may obtain payment for them and he need not apply for an "A" or a "B" licence. It seems to me to be quite reasonable, if you are dealing with farmers who occasionally, and as a matter of convenience, carry a small load for a neighbour or for somebody in the locality, to provide that he might bring something back from town as a matter of convenience, and perhaps receive some consideration for it. I do not contemplate for one moment the exclusion of that type of traffic. I think it is reasonable and proper, but there are parts of the country where the farmer would be in a position to take great advantage of this exemption. The case of Merseyside was pointed out to me the other day where, as the Committee no doubt knows, a lot of agricultural traffic passes into Liverpool. From South-West Lancashire and from Cheshire, Shropshire and parts of North Wales, agri-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
cultural vehicles bring their produce into the Liverpool market. I understand that those who cross the Mersey have special concessions as to the rates which they have to pay on the luggage ferry-boats, which is, of course, a consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those people are to be allowed to do what I understand they do at present—any hon. Member can observe them doing it by standing at the head of the floating bridge on the river Mersey—this paragraph would remove altogether from the haulage contractor or the railway company any prospect of getting the carriage of a very large proportion of that merchandise, which, in my submission, ought properly to be carried by a carrier. These people use their vehicles primarily for taking their own stuff to market. They can carry goods back again almost without payment. Whatever they may get for them on the return journey is mere profit, because they run their vehicles for the purposes of their own business. If they were not engaged in agriculture, they would have to go before the traffic commissioners and get a "B" licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to interrupt the hon. Member, but I take it that he understands that this examination only applies to the carriage of goods for farmers in the locality. If he is thinking of the people who go into Liverpool, carrying agricultural goods and coming back again with something else, that has nothing to do with the terms of this paragraph. Those people would be unable to do the return journey without a "B" licence for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROBERTS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate that, but Cheshire and Shropshire are counties with a very large dairy industry and a very great amount of feeding stuffs is carried back from Merseyside to those places. Merseyside is one of the biggest milling centres in the world, and the offals are useful for the farmers. They would all be within the paragraph. If these people were not engaged in agriculture, but in some other private business, they would have to go to the tribunal and ask for a "B" licence, to enable them to go backwards and forwards with loads. I do not know whether the Minister has contemplated that there are circumstances in which this class of competition might be very serious. This is not a restriction that I support, and I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
want to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that there is an object in this Bill besides restricting road traffic, and that is co-ordinating road traffic services of all kinds. I cannot see that leaving out this class is going to help co-ordination; it will leave a large loophole where chaos may result and uneconomic rates may well be quoted, presumably on the pretext of helping the agricultural industry. In Clause 5 the Minister is giving the agricultural industry all the help that it requires in this respect. It is clearly laid down what privileges they get. This is really a mistake, and the Committee ought not to accept it. They ought to make it clear that if farmers are going to carry those large full loads of feeding-stuffs, and that sort of thing, they should be in the same position as everybody else. They should be considered as carrying those loads for hire or reward, and they should have a "B" licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the most distressed industry in the country, without exception, I beg the Committee not to accept this Amendment. Parliament has already, in the taxation of motor vehicles, recognised the position of agriculture, and has provided a special licence for the vehicle conveying agricultural produce used by a farmer, as long as he carries the goods in his own locality. It says that he shall pay a lower rate of Licence Duty. It has also gone on to say that he shall still be entitled to that lower rate of duty as long as he only carries the goods of his neighbour and he can charge for the joint service. The real object of it is that two or three farmers may club together and send their goods to market and may come back from the markets bringing similar goods. If this Amendment were adopted, the farmer who is freed from having a licence under this Bill would have to take out an "A" or a "B" licence. I think that it would have to be a "B" licence. I submit that there would be no object in doing that, when Parliament has already conferred on the farmer the advantage in the Licence Duty that he pays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the words are studied, that advantage to the farmer is seen to be very limited in extent. It is confined to carriage in the locality where he resides. He can take goods to the market. What was said by the hon. Member who pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
posed the Amendment is quite wrong. He said that the farmer could bring back goods for other people: he can only bring back agricultural goods. That is obviously a small advantage. He is already allowed to carry goods for his neighbour under his licence duty, and he is already allowed to bring those goods back. Why should he be compelled to take out a "B" licence for this? It is not a regular service, and it only occurs now and again when his farm produce has to go to market. I beg the Committee to maintain the principle that Parliament has already adopted, and to confer this benefit on this distressed industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate the point put before the Committee by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Mr. Aled Roberts). I am sure that he will realise what has led me to include a provision of this kind. I think that it is agreed by everybody that we are at the beginning of an age of co-operative marketing by farmers, and the last thing that I want to do is to put any obstacle in the way of joint action among farmers in getting their goods to market. If the hon. Member had in mind not a district such as that with which he is familiar, but a district such as that with which I am familiar, Westmorland, he would have no objection to the application of a provision such as this to a district of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the rather special point which was raised by the hon. Member, which may occur in certain areas where there is large-scale farming in proximity to great centres of population. The answer to him is that the kind of system that he has described would lose so much by having a "C" licence instead of a "B," that it would outweigh the possibly greater difficulties in getting the "B" licence than in getting the "C." If this provision were to be in the paragraph, and they were to be entitled to a "C" licence, the possibility of their returning from Liverpool to their locality with loads other than those actually of the type specified in this provision, would be ruled out altogether. That would be a tremendous handicap for them to bear. I have no doubt that some portion of the returning loads to which the hon. Member has referred
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
would come within the terms of this provision, but at the same time they are prepared to carry, and do carry, goods of other descriptions for delivery to other people, and that would not allow them to come within the scope of the "C" licence. I feel that hon. Members fear that it would not be right to exclude the possibility of carrying other goods but the very restricted ones which are laid down in this provision. It will be found in practice that farmers and users of agricultural vehicles of the type he mentions will take up the "B" licences in preference to the "C." I am dealing with the special case that may arise. So far as the general case is concerned, I hope the Committee will agree that we should encourage to the fullest extent co-operation by farmers in the marketing of their goods, and that we should put no obstacle, however small, in the progress of that co-operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 23, to leave out from the word "locality," to the end of line 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This paragraph, as drawn, appears calculated to conflict with the exemptions which are set out in Sub-section (5). Is a farmer who desires to help another farmer in his locality, by carrying goods say from the market, to be prevented from doing so unless his vehicle is licensed under this Measure? If so, that takes away some of the value of the exemption granted under Sub-section (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head. I shall be glad of his assurance that none of the benefit of that exemption is taken away by the manner in which this paragraph is drawn. In Sub-section (5, 	<i>a</i>) exemption is given to certain agricultural vehicles but to say that a farmer is not to be allowed to help another farmer unless by the use of a licensed vehicle—especially when he is not likely to possess such a vehicle because of the exemption already mentioned—seems a rather left-handed way of helping the farmer. You give him a pat on the back in one part of the Clause, and hit him on the jaw in another. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
am sure that this is not the intention of the Minister, and I should be glad of an assurance that the farmer is not going to be prejudiced by the present wording of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as the farmer observes the conditions laid down, he will require no licence. Those conditions enable him to carry goods for another farmer provided that his vehicle is used only occasionally for that purpose; that the goods are only a small proportion of the total amount of goods, and that he takes no payment or reward for his services. So long as he complies with those conditions he does not need a licence. The effect of paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of Sub-section (3) is that if he wants to help his neighbour and at the same time help himself a little by getting hire or reward for his services, he is required to have a "C" licence. I think it right that, as soon as a farmer begins to take hire or payment for his help, he should have a licence of some kind, but we are prepared to make the concession that it should be a "C" rather than an "A" or "B" licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member was present at the commencement of this meeting when it was proposed that we should meet on two days a week, and that we should meet to-morrow, and no objection was raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us thought that we were not meeting to-morrow, but on Tuesday and Thursday of next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think hon. Members can say that they are being hurried, in view of the large number of Amendments on the Paper, and although to-day every Member of the Committee has helped his utmost, still, if we are to discuss all these Amendments properly, a considerable time will be occupied. The Chairman will allow me to say that it was to meet his convenience that the Committee met to-day instead of Tuesday, and I am sure hon. Members would not wish on that account to deprive the Government of the two sittings in this week to which they are entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appeal to the Minister. He has never been in charge of a Bill on which he has got through more Amendments during the first day of the Committee stage than on this Bill. He ought to meet us in some way. We are a very small party, and our time is taken up in such a way that we have not a minute to ourselves. We ought to have been given more notice that the Committee was going to meet to-morrow in order that we could make our arrangements. I do not think it fair that we should be asked to meet again to-morrow. The unanimity, so far, of this Committee, "passeth all human understanding," but if we are not to get some concessions, we shall have to make up our minds to block this Bill. I have no desire to threaten the Committee. All I desire is fair treatment. The Government may think that they can rush through anything they like and act like dictators, but private Members still have certain privileges, and if we do not get the consideration which is our due, we shall exercise our right to keep back the business. It is the business of the Opposition to hold up the business of the Government, and we have not done that here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
exceptional progress for a first day's sitting on a Bill of this kind. No Member desires to obstruct the Bill. We want to help, and the fact that only two or three speeches have been made this morning by my hon. Friends is an indication that we want to be helpful although some of my hon. Friends hold strong views regarding certain parts of this Bill. As the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) has pointed out, we are a small party and are kept very busy, and we have had no notice of to-morrow's meeting other than the announcement of this morning. I think the Minister will find it in the interests of the Bill to accede to our request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I have been put, by these appeals, in an unfair position. Normally the Committee would have been summoned for Tuesday, and no one would then have objected to meeting on Thursday. The Chairman, owing to a very special engagement in Wales, desired that our meeting should be on Wednesday this week. I did not object provided that we got our two days this week, and I think it a little hard that an attempt on my part to meet, as we would all wish to do, the convenience of the Chairman, should be used as a reason for depriving us of one of the sittings this week. Everybody who was put on the Committee last week must have anticipated that we should sit on Thursday, which is the day on which Committees normally sit. As to being hurried, it is clear from the Amendments that hon. Members have already had plenty of time to think about the subjects which are going to be discussed. I agree that, thanks to the co-operation of all Members on all sides of the Committee, we have made remarkable progress this morning, and in view of that it does seem churlish that I should have to refuse the request—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister refuses, I want to make a final appeal, because I am very anxious to be at this Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of DALKEITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us received notice late last night or this morning that we were on the Committee, and it is rather difficult to get acquainted with the subject at so short a notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the right of the Committee to decide when they shall meet again. The Minister was not quite correct in his statement. It is the prerogative of the Chairman to fix the first meeting without consulting anybody, if he cares to do so, but on this occasion I did consult the Minister as to meeting to-day instead of yesterday, because I could not possibly attend yesterday, and he agreed. If it is possible to meet the Minister, I hope hon. Members will be able to give him to-morrow. We have made very good progress and have been very amiable. I think we shall get on very well.
