	<p>The Minister may erect and maintain weighbridges for the purpose of testing the weights, laden and unladen, of motor vehicles.—[	<i>Sir B. Peto.</i>]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir BASIL PETO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am moving this Clause in the absence of the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Boyce). When the Minister was speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The next condition is with regard to speed limits and loading. Here, again, conditions do not differ in any way from the conditions which are now laid down by regulation. The only difference is that I hope in future we are going to be able to enforce them, at the present we have been unable to do so."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 3rd May, 1933, col. 868; Vol. 277.]</p></blockquote>
In this Bill we have made what I can only term elaborate preparations for doing what the Minister indicated, that is, making the provisions as to weighing vehicles, loaded and unloaded, really effective. The only trouble is that the supply of weighbridges in the country is utterly inadequate and under the existing process of supplying weighbridges there does not seem to be any likelihood that a sufficient number will be forthcoming. The Committee will remember that in Clause 8 we have enacted that it shall be a condition of every licence that any provisions, whether contained in any statute or in any statutory rules or orders, with regard to the limits of weight laden and unladen and the loading of vehicles, are complied with. In Clause 15 we agreed to the appointment of examiners for the purpose of securing, in the case
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
of goods vehicles, their maintenance in a fit and serviceable condition and the observance of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1930. In Clause 16 it is provided that an examiner may at any time, on production of his authority, exercise with respect to the weighing of goods vehicles all such powers as are, under Section 27 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, exerciseable by a police constable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There we have all the machinery for weighing loads and vehicles, and Section 27 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, confers upon any person authorised by a highway authority or any police constable authorised on behalf of a highway authority the power to require the person in charge of a motor vehicle to allow the vehicle and any trailer drawn by it to be weighed, laden or unladen. The Committee has agreed to all these provisions because it has realised that the practice of overloading must be stopped; it is one of the main purposes of the Bill. Unfortunately, the weighbridges available at the present time are inadequate in number, and that fact, more than any other, is likely to result in the requirements of the law, both as it exists and as it is proposed to make it under the Bill, being ignored in the future as in the past. For, obviously, unless weighbridges are available for the examiners there can be no hope of enforcing the conditions as to the weight of vehicles and loads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position with regard to the provision of weighbridges? Under Section 27 (4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, it is laid down that it shall be lawful for a highway authority to erect and maintain or join with any other highway authority in erecting and maintaining weighbridges or other machines for weighing vehicles, or to contribute towards the cost of the erection and maintenance of any such weighbridges or other machines by any other authority or person. In Sub-section (5) provision is made for any expense so incurred by the highway authority being defrayed either as expenses for general county purposes or, in the case of a borough or district council, as general expenses incurred by the council in the execution of their duties under the Public Health Acts, 1875 and 1926.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, highway authorities have not taken advantage of those provisions, and if, as the Minister stated, an attempt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
is to be made to enforce the law, the provision of weighbridges should not be left to their discretion but should be undertaken by a central authority on some definite and well thought out lines. I am moving this Clause because I am convinced that unless the Minister takes power to erect weighbridges—there is nothing compulsory in this Clause—where the existing provisions for getting weighbridges erected do not operate we shall not have the necessary supply. The provisions of Sub-section (5) of Section 27 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, enable a local authority to obtain a grant in respect of the expenditure on weighbridges. But a grant of 50 per cent., or even of 100 per cent. would not, in my opinion, ensure that the highway authorities would take action. There is more involved than the question of providing the money; there is also the question of whether there is to be any adequate distribution of weighbridges about the country, which is clearly a matter which is not best left in the hands of individual local authorities. It would be very unsatisfactory if there were an adequate number of weighbridges in one authority's area and practically none in the next and the next but one, so that a vehicle might have to travel 100 miles before it came to another weighbridge. For all these reasons I think the Bill will not be complete unless the Minister takes power to erect weighbridges upon a definite scheme under some central authority so as to ensure the provision of a suitable number of weighbridges in all parts of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTRY of TRANSPORT (Lieut.-Colonel Headlam)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to my hon. Friend with interest, and I find myself in considerable agreement with what he said. It is obvious that if this Measure is to fulfil its purpose, there will have to be more weighbridges in the country than there are at present. At the same time, we feel that it is not fair that the whole cost of the weighbridges and of the attendants to look after them should fall upon the Road Fund. We feel that it is the duty of highway authorities to do their share in the provision of weighbridges and all that appertains to them. A year ago we issued a circular to local authorities drawing their attention to the importance of
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
putting up weighbridges and offering to pay 50 per cent. of the cost. We must admit that very little notice has been taken of that circular, and the Minister will certainly have to consider what further steps he shall take. I say at once that we do not feel prepared to put the whole charge of erecting weighbridges upon the Road Fund. We hope, however, we shall be able to induce local authorities to realise the necessity of greater activity in erecting weighbridges, and I can assure the hon. baronet that the matter will receive our keen attention, because we are quite alive to the necessity of having weighbridges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MABANE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this is a Clause which ought to be pressed, for surely the Measure will not be operative if there be not an adequate number of weighbridges. The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that, notwithstanding the circular issued to the local authorities, virtually no weighbridges have been provided. This is a Clause to allow the Minister to erect these weighbridges—I suppose if the local authorities fail to do so. I may be told that if this Clause goes into the Bill it is fairly certain that the local authorities will not erect them, but require the Minister to do it. But I ask the Minister to consider the situation. If this Clause be not inserted and the Minister has no power to erect and maintain weighbridges, and the local authorities still refuse to erect and maintain them, what is the position which will then arise? How on earth will the examiners appointed under this Measure to see that its provisions are observed, and that vehicles do not carry a heavier load than is permitted, be able to discover the weight if there are no means of weighing the vehicles? I do not feel satisfied with the explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary, and I think that if there is no such Clause in the Bill we may find that it is virtually inoperative owing to the very simple omission of any means of providing weighbridges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister whether he will not consider doing something more than was indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary? We were assured that the Minister will keep a very close eye on the matter and try to see that, somehow or other, an adequate number of weighbridges is provided. His reason for opposing this Clause is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
he did not want the whole cost to fall upon the public funds of the Ministry. I do not think I should have been in order in moving the Clause if that had been my intention, though I admit that under the wording of the Clause that might be the effect of it. Will the Minister, between now and the Report stage, consider this position? The Ministry have to make grants to local authorities. If the local authorities do not act upon any concerted plan which he recommends for the provision of weighbridges, will the Minister consider "docking" a certain part of the money which would go to them and hypothecating it to the provision of weighbridges? Unless he takes means to control things through the power of the purse he will not be able to ensure a uniform provision of weighbridges such as will make the Bill workable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good our having Clause 8 and appointing examiners and making all these elaborate arrangements if there is not a weighbridge for miles and miles to enable an examiner to see whether the law is being observed or not. That is a serious matter, and I would ask the Minister to give it very serious consideration between now and the Report stage, so that we may have something in the Bill which will give him power to see that the local authorities do their work. We want something more definite than the issuing of another circular, which, if it receives the same attention as the last one, would put the Minister in a ludicrous position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of TRANSPORT (Mr. Oliver Stanley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can repeat the assurance that the Parliamentary Secretary has given that we are going to have weighbridges. They are necessary for one of the most important parts of the Bill to be carried out, and they are going to be provided. We certainly think that some part of the responsibility should fall upon the local authorities. I thought my hon. and gallant friend had explained to the satisfaction of the Committee that we cannot accept the Clause, because it would inevitably lead to the Road Fund having to take the whole responsibility, part of which we think should be borne by someone else. With regard to considering what we might do by the Report stage, I would point out that there is considerable difficulty in regard to the Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
The Chairman has been very kind in allowing this important discussion to be raised, but it is highly doubtful whether the sort of suggestion made by my hon. Friend in regard to the local authorities could possibly be within the scope of the Bill. I can assure him that, by whatever means we believe to be right, we intend to see that weighbridges are erected. If we cannot pursuade the local authorities, by the extension of grant we have made, to undertake the responsibility, it may be that we shall have to take other steps; but I can assure the Committee that those steps will be taken, and that this most essential machinery for enforcing one of the most essential parts of the Bill will be provided. I can certainly give that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major CARVER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Clause, because at an early stage I desired to move an Amendment to the same effect which was ruled out of Order on the ground that it dealt with financial matters and would require a Financial Resolution. I was asked by the County Councils' Association to move the Amendment earlier, and this Clause is practically the same. I can assure the Minister that it has the approval of the County Councils' Association and that it is their very earnest request that he should consider the matter. I was present yesterday at my own county council and the question of weighbridges came up. We wished to erect three weighbridges in the East Riding, but we cannot afford to do so because we do not get very much from the Minister. I believe he does contribute 50 per cent. of the original cost, but nothing towards maintenance. The county councils feel this matter very much indeed. I believe the Road Fund will save money if these weighbridges are erected. These vehicles have to pass over the weighbridges, to be weighed, but the poor rural local authorities cannot afford to erect them. I would ask the Minister very seriously not to allow this Clause to go by, but to take it into consideration on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's very specific assurance to the Committee that he is going to take whatever steps are necessary to see that adequate weighbridges to make the Bill work, are erected, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>—(Time occupied in inspecting and copying documents not to be reckoned driving time.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>In calculating, for the purposes of section nineteen of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, the time during which the driver of an authorised vehicle is occupied in driving the time during which the vehicle is detained for the purpose of enabling an examiner or police constable to inspect or copy documents under the powers of this Part of this Act shall not be reckoned.—[	<i>Sir G. Rentoul.</i>]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir GERVAIS RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause originally appeared as an Amendment to Clause 16, but at the Minister's own request I withdraw that Amendment and have put it down for discussion as a new Clause. The purpose of the Clause is obvious. It follows on the concession that the Minister made in Clause 12, with regard to examiners, that they should not have the power to stop a vehicle on the road. Although that concession goes some distance towards meeting certain objections that were raised, I think it is a matter of some importance that we should consider what is to happen when an examiner in the course of his duty has to examine the documents which every goods vehicle is required to carry. One knows perfectly well from the experience that one has had in having one's private licence examined, the time it takes. I should say that on the average it takes from 10 to 15 minutes, when one is stopped, to produce the driving licence and for the constable to get out his notebook and to write down all the particulars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, it may well take a great deal longer than that when he has to examine all kinds of documents of a very complicated character, such as the goods vehicles will be required to carry. However necessary that may be, it would not be considered equitable that that should entail penalties under Section 19 of the Road Traffic Act. The employer may have arranged his schedules of time for his drivers with very great care and the whole schedule may be upset because the driver is stopped by an examiner, or possibly by two or three examiners during a journey, because there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
indication that if one examiner has stopped a vehicle that another examiner further on is to be satisfied. I think there was an Amendment moved that there should be some mark put on the vehicle when it had been examined and in what circumstances, in order to avoid it being examined a little further on the journey. I hope that the Minister will accept the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOLDSWORTH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the proposed new Clause. I think everyone is agreed that so far as the working of the 1930 Act in regard to time worked by the men is concerned, it has been a failure. Everybody is agreed that that provision ought to be made a success by this Act. Unquestionably, there has been tremendous abuse in regard to drivers working long hours; we are all agreed on that point. I think the Minister will agree that it is not his desire that the man should be punished for something over which he has no control. The delay of a quarter of an hour suggested by the hon. and learned Member is very optimistic. I think that 15 minutes is a very short time in which to inspect the necessary documents and for the examiner to make notes in his notebook. This might be a serious matter. It might be that the man would be deprived of his licence, and I appeal that some provision shall be made for the time taken up by something over which neither the owner nor the driver has any control. This is an important matter, particularly in view of the fact that we ought to be determined that so far as hours of labour are concerned, the Act of 1930 shall be made a live thing. A haulage contractor told me the other day that, so far as they were concerned, they were keenly desirous of seeing the Section of the 1930 Act put into operation, because the decent employer is hindered in his business by those employers who do not care how long their men work. I appeal to the Minister so to amend the Bill that the man shall not be punished if he is honestly doing his work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TOM SMITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will not be considered that this because has been put down in the interest of the drivers of motor vehicles. If we embody the Clause in the Bill it was not make Section 19 of the Act of 1930 a live Section,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
but will almost kill it. The hon. and learned Member for Lowestoft (Sir G. Rentoul) suggested that it is possible that a lorry might be stopped three of four times during a long journey. Let us assume that that was so. Does he want the driving time allowed under Section 19 to be counted, exclusive of the waiting time? I hope the Minister will oppose the Clause, because a little imagination will show that if we embody it in the Bill it may lead to a number of evasions of Section 19. We on this Bench will oppose the Clause, and I hope the Minister will also oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HEADLAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot accept the Clause. Its acceptance would upset the whole policy of Section 19 of the other Act, which says, in Sub-section (2) that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any time spent by a driver on other work in connection with a vehicle or the load carried thereby shall be reckoned as time spent in driving."</p></blockquote>
The hon. and learned Member seems to have been singularly unlucky when he has been stopped to have his licence examined by a policeman, if he was detained 10 to 15 minutes. That has happened to me very often, but I have not been kept anything like so long a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have been singularly lucky.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HEADLAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have been lucky. The hon. and learned Member may not have had the same reasons to be pleased as I have had. He was rather optimistic as to the work that will be carried out by the examiners. When it is remembered that there are only five examiners in an area, it will be realised that it is hardly likely that a vehicle will be stopped very often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I not correct in assuming that the proposal is to start with five, but did not the Minister make it clear that a good many more may be necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut-Colonel HEADLAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If more are necessary, then the dangers which are anticipated will be greater, but when the Act comes into force the numbers will not be excessive. It is a matter 	<i>de minimis.</i> The police of Section 19 of the Act is that the time shall not only be calculated when the man is actually driving his vehicle, but that the whole time he is in charge of it and looking
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
after the contents of the vehicles shall be counted. If this Clause were inserted, it would alter the whole policy of the Act of 1930. Vehicles are stopped at the present time by the police for one reason or another. There may be a traffic jam or something of that kind, which may detain a vehicle, and if all that time is to be calculated as not part of the driving time it will make the whole of the Act of 1930 ludicrous, and this Measure still more ludicrous. For these reasons, we cannot accept the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>—(Calculation of weight of container vehicles.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>For the purposes of Part I. of this Act and of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, section twenty-six (Method of calculating weight) of the last-mentioned Act shall have effect so that the weight of a vehicle constructed to carry goods packed in detachable containers shall include the chassis of the vehicle on which the container rests but shall not include the container.—[	<i>Sir P. Dawson.</i>]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir PHILIP DAWSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the Clause is to define more clearly the weight of an unladen vehicle, and for this purpose we must go back to Section 26 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The weight unladen of any vehicle to be taken to be the weight of the vehicle inclusive of the body and all parts … . which are necessary to or ordinarily used with the vehicle when working on a road."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Clause is to clear up misconceptions which exist to-day, as is seen from decisions in the Courts, as to whether a container should be part of the vehicle or part of the load. Containers are becoming more and more popular, and their use is going to be of great benefit to those mostly concerned in transport, namely, the public at large, for whom I am speaking. Containers will vary in shape, size, and weight, according to the goods that have to be transported in them, and if the vehicle at one time has to carry one form of container, and at another time another form, and that container is part of the load, or, in other words, really takes the place of a packing case, it is not right that it should form part of the weight. We have,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
in the furniture trade of to-day, a container going to the domicile, and various articles of china, furniture, and so on, are practically packed loose in it. It is then put on the vehicle, taken to the railroad, and thence to a port, where it is put into the hold of a ship, and eventually it is delivered to the consignee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with all deliveries the use of containers is becoming more and more extensive. In the Report of the Royal Commission on Transport, there is a definite recommendation that containers should be used much more, and, therefore, anything that will hamper their use and will make it more difficult for them to be employed in regular practice, should be avoided. It seems to me that the container, which will vary in size and weight with each kind of consignment, ought not to form part of the vehicle which will carry it, a vehicle which could carry on either with or without the container.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made out an excellent case for the treatment of containers as not being part of the unladen weight of the vehicle. I do not know if the case was equally well made out in the 1930 Act, and whether it was a consequence of that that the Statute was so worded that in fact containers are not to-day treated as part of the unladen weight of the vehicle. The sort of container which my hon. Friend pictured to the Committee, namely, the substitution, for a large number of packing cases, of one all-embracing packing case, is to-day not counted in the unladen weight. The type of container that is counted is the type which, in fact, is an alternative form of body, not a container at all, and when hon. Members think that the object of this Clause is not for the purpose of taxation, but to arrive at the maximum weight which is safe for vehicles on the road, it is clear that if you say that a furniture van, where the body is fixed, may carry such and such a load, and then you say that if only they are able to detach that furniture body, they can carry so much more, either you will have to penalise the man who has the fixed body, by setting his maximum weight too low, or you must allow the man who has a detachable body to go on the road with a load which, in fact, is too heavy for safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
That is the only case which has ever come up in the Courts. The only case where a judicial decision has been arrived at was that of a detachable furniture van, where the body was put on to the chassis, and could go off and pick up furniture, just as the ordinary, fixed-body furniture van could have done. It seems to me clear that that type of case should be treated, as it was, as an alternative body, and therefore included in the unladen weight, but I can assure hon. Members who believe, and rightly believe, in the increased use of containers in the future, instead of a large number of separate packing cases, that that type of case is met by the wording of the 1930 Act, and that that type of container would not be counted in the unladen weight of the vehicle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the unavoidable absence of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. C. Davies), I am putting forward this Clause, the object of which is to avoid the necessity for companies which carry gods for themselves, and for subsidiary or associated companies, and for no one else, to be compelled to apply for an "A" or a "B" licence when, in point of fact, what they are actually doing comes clearly within the intention of the "C" licence, inasmuch as they are in no different position
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
from any ordinary firm that carries its own goods on the roads. There appears to be some little doubt in the Bill as drafted whether these companies and associated companies would, in fact, be able to obtain a "C" licence. I agree that the relationship between companies within a group may vary considerably, both from a legal and a practical point of view. It is occasionally extraordinarily difficult to find a satisfactory definition to cover the whole ground adequately, but we have attempted in this Clause to meet some of the main contingencies which might be anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not remind the Committee that there are various types of organisation for the carriage of goods between associated companies. First of all, there is a company that is established by a parent company, with many associates, for the carriage of the goods of all the companies in the group for hire or reward, but not for profit, but not for the service of the general public. Then there may be a manufacturing or trading company carrying the goods of associated companies for hire or reward, but not for profit. Then there are vehicles jointly owned and controlled by one or more companies within a group, for the carriage of the goods of the whole group. I think it also should be emphasised that it is quite a common situation, in connection with combines and groups and associations of this kind, for the management and administration of what may be called the service departments, of which, of course, road distribution is one, to be common to the whole organisation, although the legal structure of the combine or groups, may be totally separate. I hope the Minister will agree that there is a case to be made out that such people should be entitled to a "C" licence, and that, therefore, he will accept this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure my hon. and learned Friend will appreciate that his Clause goes very far beyond the case, and the perfectly fair case, which he has mentioned. He has talked about associated companies, but he will see that in his Clause the only test of association is shareholding in the carrying company, and in fact this Clause could be used by an indefinite extension of shareholding, limited, if necessary, to one share, to cover a group of companies which had
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
no real connection with each other whatsoever, but, simply by this manipulation, were able to make use of a carrying company under a "C" licence instead of an "A" or a "B" licence. That, clearly, could lead, in the hands, anyhow, of the more powerful and larger companies, to a complete destruction of the "A" licence system, and I am sure my hon. and learned Friend did not intend that by this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case he raised is one of practical effect, but I think it is substantially met by the Bill as it stands. I would not, of course, give any general opinion as to what type of associated company would or would not be able to operate under a "C" licence. That must depend on the legal relationships between the companies concerned. I will assume the case where such a company would not be able to operate under a "C" licence, and see, under the Bill, what hardship is suffered. There is, first, the case of the group of companies who form one company to carry out the haulage for alt of them. That company in those circumstances clearly would require an "A" licence, and of that, I think, nobody complains. The only objection is, Would that company have any difficulty in obtaining the licence when it applied for it? Because, clearly, unless you could be certain of obtaining a licence for that company, it would cause a certain amount of disturbance in the transport arrangements of the group. Is it really likely that, when a company like that applied for an "A" licence, and specified that it intended only to offer transport facilities to its own associated group of companies, any objection would be taken to it or any difficulty raised to the application being granted? It is true that no conditions could be imposed, and that once it had obtained the licence it could break the undertaking, but, naturally, if it did that, when it came for a renewal of the licence, the past history would be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other type of case is where one of the associated companies, besides doing its own haulage business, has a surplus of vehicles, which it uses for doing the work of the other members of the group. In that case, I think, it is clear that the vehicles would have to be operated under a "B" licence, but there, of course, we have made, by Amendment during the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
Committee stage, provision for exactly that type, so that the company will be able to apply for a "B" licence, on the condition that it carries only for those particular specified companies. That condition can be attached to the licence, and in those circumstances, again, I suggest that there is, in fact, no danger of such an application being refused. I hope may hon. and learned Friend will realise that his Clause goes far wider that he intends, but that the very real point that he has raised is, in fact, I think, substantially met in the Bill as it has been amended in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that perhaps the wording of the Clause is not quite satisfactory, and, in view of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this Amendment is to make a slight increase in the representation of local authorities, and so do away with a feeling of injustice that they are under-represented in their capacity as highway authorities looking after the costs and so on of the roads, and assisting the Minister in the operation of Clause 36. Including Scotland, there are only four representatives of local authorities on the Council, while there are as many as seven representatives of users of the highways, and persons interested in other methods of transport—railways, canals, coastwise shipping, harbour and dock authorities—are given five. Moreover, there are also certain interests, such as labour and trading interests, which are represented, and incidentally, the trading interests, who have four representatives, would be concerned, by their use of the highways, in increasing the expenditure of local authorities. Therefore, it would seem that the local authorities are very much overweighted on this Council, and I would ask the Minister to consider removing what is an undoubted injustice. So far, he has
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
got his Bill through very successfully, and without any complications, and if he could see his way to give local authorities this concession I am sure it would be to the advantage of the operation of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it will be to the advantage of the Committee if, at this earliest possible stage, I make a few general remarks on the Schedule. I think it must be obvious to Members of the Committee that it is impossible for me to accept Amendments at this stage. It would mean a sort of higgledy-piggledy arrangement of the Council. If I accept one Amendment, I do not know whether a later one is going to be carried or not. I propose, therefore, if I may, to ask Members of the Committee, on these various Amendments, to give me their reasons for the alterations which they seek. I am not saying that because I do not mean in the long run to do anything. I realise that this Advisory Council should be subject to modifications in accordance with the views of the Committee. But I do say that, if it is modified, it should be modified as a whole, and not as the result of individual discussions on individual points. I propose, therefore, to ask hon. Members, when they have stated their reasons and when we have discussed the question, not to press their Amendments, but to leave it to me at a later stage, in the light of the discussions this morning, to modify and, if necessary, increase the size of the Council, and to submit it to the House at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to one or two Amendments which have nothing to do with numbers, I would say at once that I propose to accept the two Amendments in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for the West Derby Division of Liverpool (Sir J. Sandeman Allen)—In page 36, line 13, after the word "Canals," to insert the words "(otherwise than railway owned or controlled)"; and, in line 15, after the word "authorities", to insert the words "(otherwise than railway owned or controlled)". These Amendments simply make it plain that the canals and harbours meant are canals and harbours not owned by railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word generally about the composition of the Council, because I think it may remove a considerable amount of misunderstanding, and, therefore, perhaps do away with a good deal of false argument which might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
otherwise be addressed to the Committee. The Committee will realise that we have been careful at all stages of the Bill to avoid making anything dependent on the recommendation of the Council. The provision has always been for consultation with the Council. Therefore, no circumstances can arise in which importance can be attached to the voting strength of any interest. The purpose of the Council will not be to give me a recommendation which has been carried by a majority, and, therefore, in circumstances which would make the voting strength of a particular interest of great importance, but to enable me to consult them; and there, of course, the important thing will be the strength and vigour with which particular points of view are put forward by the interests, however strong or weak they may be numerically, which are chiefly concerned in the particular matter. I suggest that the type of argument that such-and-such an interest is numerically under-represented as compared with some other type of interest is not one which ought to weigh with the Committee. The real argument is as to whether we can find some particular type of interest which has a right to expression on these matters, and which is not so represented on the Council that its views can be properly expressed and properly conveyed to me. I realise that arguments may be advanced during the morning which will convince me that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I would stress, and on which I think hon. Members will agree with me, is that it is important, if the Council is to function at all, that its number should be kept as low as possible. Most hon. Members seem to have realised that, because I see that in nearly every case where they have sought to increase the representation of some interest they have tried to make a corresponding decrease in that of another, and so maintain the level of the Council more or less untouched. I ask hon. Members, when they press for these variations, to bear in mind the supreme importance of keeping the number as low as possible. We could quite easily do away with the whole value of the Council if we unnecessarily increased its number to meet the particular demands of particular interests. I would again emphasise that mere voting strength is not of real importance. What is of importance is that all the views
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
which I ought to be in a position to hear upon these important matters are represented on the Council, so that it may provide a channel of communication with me. I have intervened at this stage because I thought that we might be able to shorten the discussion on the Schedule, but I can assure my hon. Friends that I realise that, in view of the discussions this morning, it will no doubt be necessary to make changes, and that I am not adopting a rigid attitude towards any of these Amendments; but I would urge that it would be unwise and unsatisfactory to deal with the matter piece-meal, and that it would be much better that, in the light of our present discussions, I should submit at a later stage an Advisory Council modified in accordance with the views which have been expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOLDSWORTH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think everyone will agree that the Minister's suggestion is a wise one, but I should like to take the opportunity, not of arguing as to how many representatives of specific interests there should be, but to mention two—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt my hon. Friend, but I think it will be convenient, the Committee having kindly permitted me to make a general statement, if we keep the arguments to the definite Amendments as they arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall call each Amendment, and an explanation can then be given upon it. I think that that is what the Minister desires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument that no importance is to be attached to voting strength to a certain extent increases my desire to see five representatives of local authorities. There are five kinds of local authorities, representing millions of people in the country. Some of them are very jealous of their own rights, and it would be a little difficult for the Minister to choose, perhaps, three out of the five. There are the county councils, the county boroughs, the municipal boroughs, the urban districts and the rural districts. Therefore, I suggest that they might have five representatives instead of three, although of course it would be open to him to take two from one kind of authority and leave out another if in that way he got particularly good men. I am much obliged to the Minister for what he has said, and thoroughly agree that the way in which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
he proposes to deal with the matter is the best, but I would ask him, when he goes into the matter, to consult with the representative associations as to what numbers they consider best. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. PARKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 36, line 8, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Co-operative Union, Limited</p></blockquote>
The whole Committee will be indebted to the Minister for his statement that he is prepared to give consideration to all the interests concerned, and to bring the matter up later, presumably on Report, when I hope he may be able to find some modification which will secure a better distribution of the interests represented. The composition of the Council as set out in the Bill is a kind of omnibus Council, including most of the interests concerned, but I think that there should be provision for representation of the co-operative movement among the users of mechanically propelled vehicles. The co-operative movement, if not the largest, is one of the largest single road users in the country The Government have now made them really financial members of the British Empire, and, as a result, they expect the Government to give them fair play in other directions. The Co-operative Societies have always had a point of view of their own, and, whether they have been right or wrong, they have not been afraid to express it. The English and Scottish Wholesale Societies have something like 800 vehicles. In addition there are about 1,200 retail societies, all of whom, practically speaking, use one, two, three or more vehicles, and some of them have large numbers. For example, the Woolwich and the London Societies are extremely large users of road vehicles, and we feel that they ought to be given representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise the hon. Member's anxiety on the subject of this Amendment, but I think he was perhaps a little unfortunate in the grounds which he chose for submitting it. It seems wrong to base the argument for the inclusion of a representative of co-operatives on their road user, because I think the hon. Member has mistaken the
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
character of the five people who are to represent the users of mechanically propelled vehicles. They cannot be representatives of particular interests or owners, but must be representatives of particular types of users. Some will represent the ordinary private motorist, some the passenger type of vehicle, some goods vehicles as a whole, and so on. The hon. Gentleman will realise that the mere argument that you happen to own a particular number of one type of vehicle is not really a good argument for including you in that category. The Co-operative Union must be discussed, not as users of vehicles, but as a trading interest, and, if a representative is to be dropped out to make room for them, it should be one of the representatives of trading interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the hon. Gentleman, if the debate is continued, whether it is possible for him to make the point to the Committee that the Co-operative Union is in some way distinguished from other trading interests, and has a special point of view? It seems to me that, from the purely transport point of view, its interests are exactly the same as those of any large distributive store. It seems to me that the case which ought to be made, and the distinction which ought to be drawn, is not between the Co-operative Union and some other owners of a fleet of road vehicles, but between the Co-operative Union and other trading interests as users of particular forms of transport. If my hon. Friends can convince the Committee or me that there is some real distinction of interest as between the Co-operative Union and any other large multiple trader, no doubt the Committee, and the House at a subsequent stage, will be willing to consider this alteration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt in my mind that the Co-operative Movement has a distinct point of view to put. Nobody knows that better than the Members, of this Committee. The whole trade interests of this country are up against the Co-operative Movement. They have used their whole influence with this Government to see that co-operators are taxed. Therefore, it is essential that the Co-operative Movement should have distinct representation on any Council of this kind safeguarding their interests, because it is evident to me that the whole
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
power of capitalism—and this is part of it—will be used on every occasion to thwart the advance of the Co-operative Movement. It is imperative, therefore, that the Co-operative Movement should have a representative on this Council. But that is a point I must leave with the Minister. I have risen, however, to ask about the representation which Scottish local authorities are to have. The local authorities are to have only one representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will have to raise that on the Question "That this be the Schedule to the Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to take my instructions from the Minister when I am in Order. I leave it to you, Sir William, to rule me out of Order. The Minister stated that it was not a case of the voting strength of members of the Council. It was a Council in a consultative capacity. He said he was going to leave it with the Council and after he had heard the expression of opinion of all the different representatives he would then be in a position to decide. He said that some would want an increase and others would take the other point of view. I think I am entitled at this junction to bring in the position of the local authorities in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think my hon. Friend heard what we afterwards decided—that we should begin, at any rate, by discussing each Amendment separately, and when it came to the question of the Schedule being added to the Bill we could raise any point which had not been covered by the Amendments. I think he will agree that it is perhaps a little inconvenient, when we are discussing the position of co-operators and one of his hon. Friends may want to reply to the speech I made, that he should discuss Scottish local authorities, because another hon. Member might think it an appropriate time to raise the position of pedestrians or canals. I suggest that we should first deal with the Amendments and then there will be ample opportunity to bring up any subject which the Amendments have not touched.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that would be the better course. If this Amendment were withdrawn, it would be possible for the hon. Member to raise this point on
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
the question of local authorities in Scotland; but I think it would be better for him to discuss it in the way the Minister has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to know exactly when I can get in here, because it was after our leader had gone over and consulted with the Minister that the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Parkinson) came down to me and told me that this was where I should get in. I do not know how these arrangements are worked. I seems to me the arrangement works with some sections of the Committee, but evidently does not work with ours. As I am telling you, that is what happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject of conversation between the hon. Member opposite and myself was not even about this Bill, but about some quite different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only to deal with circumstances as. I know them. The hon. Member for Wigan knows that what I am stating is perfectly true. He told me that following on the co-operative question I would get in here; otherwise, I should have put in an Amendment here. I was led to believe that this was the right place to raise the question, and not on the Schedule—not at the tail end of the business. Scotland is not going to be at the tail-end at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid it is not in order for the hon. Member to discuss his point on this Amendment. If this Amendment be withdrawn, it will be possible to raise it on the question of the local authorities in Scotland, and the hon. Member can move an Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have I got to wait to see whether this Amendment is withdrawn, and if it is withdrawn shall I be in order in moving my Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I would suggest that the best course would be for the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not going to agree to what the Minister suggests. I am going to have my way here. I am going to have what I think, and not what he thinks is going to suit him. I know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
that I shall get no concessions from the Minister, because we are getting none. I am going to state my point of view, and then I shall have to leave the country to judge whether Scotland is being fairly treated by the Minister or not. Time will determine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GEORGE HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reply to the points put by the Minister regarding the Co-operative Union having one representative. Provision is made for four representatives of trading interests on the Advisory Council. The Minister asked whether there was anything peculiar about the position of co-operative societies which would justify him in agreeing to there being a representative of the Co-operative Union. We say that there is something peculiar. In the first place, the English and Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Societies own and control between 800 to 1,000 of these vehicles. In addition, there are 1,200 retail societies scattered over the country. These retail societies have certain areas which have been a kind of preserve to them; no one society can trespass upon the area which has been allocated to another. Quite apart from the productive side of the movement, we have England, Wales and Scotland divided up into areas for the purpose of distributing goods through retail societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You cannot compare the Co-operative movement with a store like Harrod's or Selfridges. Each of those is a sort of central store, from which they deliver within a given area a large proportion of the commodities they sell. I am not sure whether they control their vehicles or let the delivery of goods out to contract; with co-operative societies there is no postal trade, or very little postal trade. The whole of the goods sent out from the depôts controlled by the wholesale societies or by the retail societies are delivered by road or rail. Then, as was mentioned by my hon. Friend, we must remember that there is, rightly or wrongly, a good deal of hostility shown by private traders to co-operative societies because of the progress they have made. The co-operative societies feel—again, shall I say, rightly or wrongly—that there is just the possibility that they will not find any private trader who can put their point of view in quite the same way as it could be put
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
by a representative of the Co-operative movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Co-operative movement, wholesale and retail, has a membership of nearly 7,000,000 persons. It is not an individual membership in the sense that one member represents one person. Each member of the Co-operative movement, or the major portion of them, represents a family, and it is true to say that one-half or almost one-half of the population of this country are connected with the Co-operative movement through their parents or some other member of the family who are members of a co-operative society. We suggest that the membership figure of the co-operative societies would entitle them to a member on this Advisory Council, and I think we are quite modest in asking for only one member. Further, we say that the amount of trade done by the co-operative societies, who, including the wholesale and retail societies, have a turnover of £300,000,000 a year, should in itself warrant our request receiving consideration from the Minister. I will not repeat what I said regarding the influence of the co-operative societies in each area, though that should also warrant some consideration by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at it from every point of view—the influence which the Co-operative movement has upon the trading life of the country and upon the consumers of goods, the magnitude of their trade, and, though I do not want to emphasise this point too much, the suspicion they have that their particular point of view cannot be voiced by anyone other than a member of a co-operative society—we beg of the Minister, in considering the constitution of this Council, seriously to take into account the allocation of one of the seats to a representative of the Co-operative Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister and the hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. G. Hall) to consider Sub-section (4) of Clause 36? It says there that
0	<br><blockquote><p>"before appointing a person to be a representative member of the Council, the Minister shall consult with such bodies or associations representative of the interest concerned as he thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
That being so, is there any justification for taking out from all the trading interests of the country, wholesale and retail, import and export, merchanting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
and warehousing, one particular form of trading organisation and putting it into the Schedule compulsorily? The arguments of the hon. Member for Aberdare as to the amount of trade done seems to me to carry very little weight. If they are so important, their trading would have to be one-fourth of the retail and wholesale trade of the country, because there are only four representatives of the trading interests on the Council. Obviously, the Minister will consult them in making his appointment, and he may probably appoint a member who specially represents their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not all. It seems to me that their interests on this question of road transport, as the Minister indicated, cannot be opposed to those of any other trading interests. It is only transport questions that are to be discussed. It is not a question of Income Tax, or anything of that sort. I think there is confusion as to what this Council is going to do. It is conceivable that on the Council the co-operative interests could quite well be represented by the representative of some other body whose interests are identical. If it would be reasonable to consult the co-operative body as to the appointment of one of the four trading members, I think it can be safely left to the Minister to see that one of the trading members of the council is in some special sense representative of the co-operative trade that is done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. PETHERICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will not accept the Amendment. I can see no reason why the Co-operative Movement should be given preferential treatment. There is nothing to prevent the Minister appointing a member of the co-operative societies as users of mechanically-propelled vehicles. The Bill does not say that he shall do so, and it ought not to say that he shall do so. That would be laying down a very dangerous principle which might be extended. In the case of the taxation of co-operative societies for Income Tax, unfortunately, as many of us think, they have for many years been given preferential treatment, and if we were to admit in a Bill of this nature special mention of the co-operative societies, the same claim would be made by the co-operative societies on many other Bills of a similar nature which might be brought before Parliament. There is no sound reason
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
for putting co-operative societies in a preferential position over private traders. Therefore, I hope the Minister will not accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a manuscript Amendment, and it is moved in the interests of Scotland. The Minister has evidently gone to some trouble and pains to understand the transport of Britain before he started to handle this Bill, otherwise he would not have been able to deliver the speeches which he has made. Having done that, he must be aware of the tremendous amount of work that Scotland has contributed towards making possible the highways not only of this country but of civilisation. Civilisation owes to a fellow-countryman of mine a surface on the roads which they would not otherwise have had—macadam. That is why we have macadamised roads. The name is derived from Macadam—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I do not know why hon. Members laugh. One of these days I will give them something to laugh about. You allow hon. Members to stand here, Sir William, reading every word of their speeches, and they have received nothing but consideration from the hon. Members on this bench, although time and again we have listened to the most awful nonsense being talked. I hope that you will watch what is going on.

Scotland is a distinct nation and distinct in nothing more than its highways and in its laws regarding highways, and it is only to have one representative on the consultative board. Why should Scotland have only one representative when the trading interests have four and the users of mechanically-propelled vehicles have five? All the local authorities of Scotland have simply one representative. Why this bias? That is what I term it. The Scottish local authorities represent millions of people. They represent that part of the British Isles where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
the wealth of Britain is produced. It is not in London that the wealth is produced; London is the place where it is spent. All that we are going to get is simply one representative. I do not think it is fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that this body is to be a consultative body. That means that it will require to be consulted on the questions of roads, highways, and bridges. Our highways and roads in Scotland are quite different from those of England. We have not simply hill and dale but we have mountainous country, where roads have been newly made, at tremendous expense, in opening up particularly the highlands of Scotland. The local authority in order to open up the highlands of Scotland are on the brink of ruin, and they ought to get some consideration. They have never had any particular consideration, comparatively speaking, with some other parts of the British Isles. They ought to be brought more into consultation in order to safeguard their peculiar interests. We have tremendously heavy traffic, particularly in the West of Scotland, where we have to convey loads of 20 to 30 tons along our streets. That does not happen in any other part of Britain, and such conditions have to be safeguarded. The local authorities have to be in a position to keep in direct contact with the big employers of labour who are handling these tremendously heavy loads, in order to decide whether or not the traffic should be put on to the railways, or on to the canals, or kept on the roads. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter. It is impossible for one man on a consultative committee to do justice to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that my hon.

I am reminded by one of my hon. Friends that whereas I thought that one Scotsman was ample to represent the interests of his country, it takes three Englishmen to do the same for England. My hon. Friend, I think, will acquit me of any desire to insult the race to which he is proud to belong. The point which he raises is a very fair one for consideration—whether one re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
presentative can effectively put to me the point of view of the local authorities in Scotland? Therefore, I shall have to consider whether there is any conflict of interest between the local authorities so that one man would be unable to put forward the common view taken on behalf of all of them. That certainly is a point worthy of consideration. On the other hand, I would point out that in comparison with the local authorities of England, the local authorities of Scotland, from the purely numerical point of view have been well treated. If we are to discuss population, wealth and size, I would suggest that the population and wealth of England are in quite a different ratio from that of Scotland than three to one, and it would be difficult if any increase be made in the representation of the Scottish authorities to resist a proportionate increase in the representation of the English authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let me emphasise the fact that it does not matter two-pence to me if we add to the members of this Council any number of representatives, because it is purely a consultative body. There will be no voting and no decisions on the part of the Council which in any way will tie me down or hamper me. The only thing about which I am anxious is that we shall not make the Council of such a size and so useless that it will not be worth while any of the interests having representatives on it. Therefore, I shall have to weigh these two considerations one against the other. I can assure my hon. Friend that it is a subject which, I realise, is of considerable importance, and especially that it is looked upon as such in Scotland, and it is one to which I will give my attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Everybody desires the Minister to get his Bill this morning, and I hope, therefore, my Amendment will not suffer owing to the brevity of my remarks in moving it. In the Schedule there is no specific reference to representation on the Advisory Council of the users of mechanically propelled goods vehicles and the whole of the Bill regulates goods vehicles to such an extent that we think there ought to be some separate representation for the users of such vehicles, as distinct from those using other vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think, on that point, I can give my hon. Friend complete reassurance. Obviously, among the five representatives of the users of mechanically propelled vehicles, goods vehicles will have at least one and possibly more than one representative. It is clear that they represent one of the most important sections of the mechanical users of the roads, and their point of view is one that it will be vital for me to hear on a great many important subjects. I can give the hon. Member every assurance that they will be fully represented within the ambit of the users of mechanically propelled vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I move this Amendment, in conjunction, not with the Amendment to increase the representation of the railways from two to three, with which I originally inserted it on the Paper, leaving the total number exactly the same as at present, namely, 22, but in connection, with the Amendment in the names of the hon. Member for Stockton-on-Tees (Mr. Macmillan) and of myself, to increase the representation of the railways from two to four. I will not say anything that the Minister could regard as looking at it from the numerical point of view, in connection with a voting which does not exist, but there must be an object that the Minister had in view in putting down such a number as five representing mechanically propelled vehicles. No other interest or item in this Schedule is represented by more than four; the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
trading interests, including agriculture, are represented by four. But, apart from the number, it seems to me that if you want to get a representative of each distinctive branch of mechanically propelled vehicles, four is ample, namely, one for heavy goods traffic, one for lighter goods traffic, one for public passenger transport, and one for private passenger transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the railways, there is a very strong argument why they should be increased to the same level as the road transport. I do not ask for more, but there is certainly no difference, from the point of view of importance in capital represented, or amount of traffic carried, or anything else. There are the four main groups of railways, and there is a very good reason why these groups should each be represented by one upon the Advisory Council. That is why, when we come to it, I should rather support my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton-on-Tees than move my own original Amendment. For the moment, I intend to give these brief reasons why I can see no reason why the road transport interests should be represented by five rather than by four—should, in fact, be represented by more representatives than any other interest in the Schedule—and I think they ought to be represented by the same number as those who represent the railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will realise that you cannot compare the representation which is necessary for the mechanical users of roads and that which is necessary for the railways, because you have in the railways no such complete diversity of interest and representation as you have among the road users. Indeed, even my hon. Friend could not, I think, suggest that it would be possible to represent these road users with fewer than four, and it is only with regard to this fifth member that he is in doubt. I own that the position which he takes up is not without its basis. My real trouble—and I am frank with the Committee—is when it comes to the representation of the private motorists. Without going into detail, hon. Members will realise that there are two organisations which claim to represent those motorists, and the danger is, that if you try to confine the representation to one, simply for the sake of theoretical argument, you will then get
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
one representative who is never able to speak for the whole motoring world as such. Therefore, from the point of view of the Minister who expects to get advice from him, it renders the whole of that representation entirely useless. Those are the considerations which, so far at any rate, have led me to include five as the number necessary for the users of the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the railways, I think it all depends on the point of view that you adopt. If there is to be expressed to the Advisory Council and to me a railway point of view, then the two members whom they will be able to send are obviously capable of expressing that view, clearly and forcibly. If, on the other hand, you are going to express to the Council and to me, and through me to the public, a Great Western point of view, a London, Midland and Scottish point of view, a North-Eastern point of view, and a Southern point of view, I agree that it cannot adequately be done with fewer than four members. Is that the point of view of the railways, that they are going to this Transport Advisory Council as the representative of the particular company from which they come? If so, I shall certainly have to consider the demands which they make, but I say at once that it will, from my point of view, entirely weaken, if not almost destroy, the consideration which it will be possible for me to give to the views that they there advance, and which are subsequently transmitted to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that it is a very important point for the railways to decide, whether they are going to use this Transport Advisory Council as a place in which an industry which is tending more and more to co-operation between its separate branches will be able to put forward common views, on a matter of this great importance, or whether it is a place to which each separate company has to go to advance its own interests. Whichever decision the railway companies take, I shall certainly give most earnest consideration to it, but I hope, for the sake of the utility of this Council and the chances of its being able to do something really effective in the co-operation and co-ordination of all forms of transport, that the railways will decide that it is a place to which they will go and speak

This Amendment was put down in conjunction with, and complementary to, the second last Amendment on the Paper, in which it is proposed that pedestrians and cyclists should be added to the Schedule. We feel that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"users of the roads other than as above mentioned"</p></blockquote>

I suggest that the addition of a pedestrian representing the point of view of the man in the street would be of assistance to the Minister. One knows, of course, that one may attach too much importance to membership of this Transport Council, because it is purely advisory, and it is open to the Minister, if any particular class is

	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
forced upon him, to ignore that particular class, in carrying out his duties, but the addition of pedestrians would give confidence to the public who feel that the point of view of the pedestrian, the man in the street, is not sufficiently considered when dealing with transport questions. If the Minister is in any difficulty as to how to get a suitable pedestrian, I would suggest that he approach one of the societies, like the Pedestrians' Association or the Safety First Association, who would readily provide somebody with a knowledge of motor transport and be at the same time, ready and able to take the point of view of the man in the street. With regard to cyclists, I am less insistent about them, but they are a very large class, and I think the Minister might very well consider them also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words which the hon.

There is something to be said for the view that their interests with regard to highway construction, speed limits, and things of that kind may be at variance, and I will consider, when I come to review the composition of this Council, whether it would be necessary, in order that both sections should be able to put their views before me, that they should each have a representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is no intention on the part of the railways to ask for four rather than two representatives with the object of putting forward the special views of each of the amalgamated railway groups. I very much hope that they will speak with a united voice, and will represent as a united body the railway point of view to the council; but I understand that the members of the council will sit as individuals and not as representatives, and there is some advantage in the railways being represented by a rather larger number than two. On the Minister's argument, if they speak as one, one representative would serve, but these gentlemen who with great skill manage
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
these great undertakings are very busy people, and there is some advantage in arranging for a number which would allow of all the general managers being members of the council, and would therefore allow the case of the railways to be put forward by each or any of them. It is rather a matter of mechanical convenience. It is felt also that, with a number which would allow of a larger selection, including, possibly, individuals with specialised knowledge of railway work other than the representatives of the railways as a whole—that is to say the general managers themselves—it would be possible to bring before the Council certain specialised views in connection with railway work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure the Committee will sympathise with the desire of the Minister to keep the number of members of the advisory council within reasonable limits, but this is an Amendment of substance, put forward at the request of the shipping industry. Presumably, unless it is accepted, the Minister will have no power
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
under the Bill to take such steps as would give him the assistance on the council of a representative of the deep-sea ship-owners as such. The shipping industry is entirely in favour of the fullest co-operation between all three forms of transport, and it is felt that the main advantage of the council would be in bringing competing hauliers under the co-ordinating influence of the Ministry. If that satisfactory co-operation is to be obtained, some amendment of the constitution of the council would appear to be necessary. The Minister has said that he intends to review the composition of the council, but I submit that, unless this Amendment is accepted, he would have no power to review its composition in the sense of providing for a representative of shipping as such, because, so far as I can see, such a representative could hardly be brought in under any of the headings in the Schedule. The most satisfactory way of dealing with the matter would be to omit the word "coastwise" and to have two representatives of the shipping industry—of coastal shipping and of deep-sea shipowners. The interests of these are distinct. There is almost as much distinction between them as between trading interests generally. I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to the suggestion, and possibly he may see his way to accept the Amendment at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether he would find this a convenient opportunity to indicate to the Committee any arrangements that may have been arrived at on the subject that we were discussing the other day, affecting coastal shipping. I rather gather that negotiations have been going on, but I do not know whether they have had any result. It is one of the most important points that have been left outstanding in the discussions of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I cannot say anything at the moment on the wider point which has been left unsettled. With regard to my hon. and learned Friend's Amendment, he is not quite right in saying that, if it were not for an Amendment of this character, I should have no power to put a representative of shipping on the Council, because the Clause gives me power to nominate three members. Obviously, if interests have
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
been left out, it is more satisfactory to deal with them in the Schedule than merely to leave it to that general power, but I was not very clear as to my hon. and learned Friend's argument, and it would perhaps be as well if, between now and Report, I could have the position explained to me a little, more clearly. It is probably because of my ignorance of some of the normal terms with regard to coastal shipping. I was under the impression for some time, when my hon. and learned Friend talked about deep-sea shipping, that he meant something of the same kind as, say, transatlantic traffic. If so, there can obviously be no claim, on his own showing, to representation on this Committee. He says that the object of the council is to co-ordinate competing hauliers, but I do not think he would suggest that a freight steamer from this country to New York competes in any way with the hauliers represented on the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, he has in view two different types of what I should call coastal trade—some vessels, perhaps, running on a regular service from port to port, and some employed more as tramps carrying traffic around our own coasts—it would be possible to argue that they were competing forms of traffic, and there might be some dissimilarity between their interests which would justify separate representation on the council. That is a point which perhaps my hon. and learned Friend, between now and a further stage of the Bill, will bring more clearly to my notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has given us an opportunity of somewhat clarifying the position. I should like the committee to understand that this Amendment in no way emanates from the coastwise interests, but rather from the Parliamentary Committee of the Chamber of Shipping and the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association, which represent the whole of the Mercantile Marine of Great Britain. It is well known that the shipping interests are probably the largest customers of the railway companies, and their interests, therefore, are very largely interlocked. Whereas the railways carry annually something like 166,000,000 tons of coal, coastwise interests only handle about 20,000,000 tons of coal. Almost the whole of our exports and imports must pass at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
some time or other by rail. The railways handle something like 10,000,000 tons annually for the timber trade alone, and, as has been proved by the Bristol case, a considerable percentage of our grain imports passes by rail. I hope, therefore, that the Minister may be able to consider favourably the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say at once that what has been said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Stretford (Major Renwick) has considerably shaken me in my desire to assist my hon. and learned Friend.

We have had much discussion as to the character and work of the Advisory Council, and, although the Minister said that there was no question of voting strength, I think he will agree that, from the point of view of specialised knowledge, the Labour representatives, and especially those connected with the Transport Union, will have knowledge of a great deal of what the Council will have to discuss. We think, therefore, that two members out of 22—or, excluding the four representatives of trading interests, two out of 18—is inadequate from our point of view. Labour is engaged in nearly all these classes of work—coastwise shipping, canals, harbours, docks, railways and so on—and we think that, in asking for five representatives, we are extremely modest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I indicated at the beginning, I am not very much impressed by numerical arguments as to whether there should be two or three out of the 18, or what the proportions are. What really would interest me to know is how far it is possible to represent the different labour organisations concerned with transport problems under the same head, and any information my hon.

If we were to cover all the trade unions concerned we should have to ask for a greater number than five. I have in mind the Transport Workers' Union, the National Union of Railwaymen and the Seamen and Firemen's Union; they deal with road transport, rail transport and coastwise shipping, apart from other organisations dealing with various vehicles. But I will not take up time by enumerating those organisations now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is one to which many of my hon.

Members would rather submit to the slight inconvenience of being late for lunch rather than be brought back on a subsequent occasion to deal with only one Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Mr. A. Roberts) has throughout the proceedings shown a very great regard for the time of the Committee and has shown his capacity for being brief even when the subject is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. ROBERTS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 37, line 34, column 3, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In sub-section (6) of section fifty-nine the words 'when modifying charges.'"</p></blockquote>
I am moving this Amendment on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for West Swansea (Mr. L. Jones). It is a short Amendment, to add to the Schedule the three words "when modifying charges," and the effect of passing this Amendment will be to take the words out of Section 59 of the Railways Act, 1921. In case the Minister may retort, as he sometimes does, that there is a catch in the Amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
ment I will show at once that it is a very important one. It is the tail-end of the Schedule, and the sting is in the tail. Traders are closely concerned with the methods of fixing railway charges, because ultimately the traders have to "see the railway companies right." Either the standard revenue has to be made up by increasing the rates or the traders suffer in the matter of the service they get. The railway rates were made originally by the Railway Rates Tribunal, or approved by them, and in approving them certain definite points had to be taken into consideration, such as the method by which the maximum development and extension, in the public interest, of the carriage by railway of merchandise and other traffic could be ensured, and also the effect of the charges which had been made by the railway companies up to that time and their probable effect in the future in encouraging or diminishing railway traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every year the Railway Rates Tribunal must review the position of railway charges and take into consideration certain things, such as the effect of the standard charges upon the railway companies. Up to now the Railway Rates Tribunal, when reviewing these charges, have been prevented from taking into account very important information, on account of the wording of this Section 59. They should take into account the means best calculated to ensure the maximum development and extension in the public interest of the carriage of goods by railway, and whether existing charges tend to increase or diminish traffic, but they cannot do either of those things unless they are considering the modification of charges. What should really guide the tribunal in deciding whether to modify charges is the effect of the charges already made. It should not be necessary for the tribunal to have to say: "We are going to modify charges. Having decided to do so, we will now hear what you have to say as to the effect of the rates already in operation." It should be open to traders to approach the Railway Rates Tribunal and say: "Because of certain things we want you to consider modifying charges."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment attains a good deal more importance as a result of Clause 29 of the Bill we are now discussing, because of the agreed charges. It is no use sug-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
gesting that an agreed charge is going to be higher than the exceptional rates or the standard charges. The whole object of an agreed charge is to make the traffic costs cheaper. If it is going to make it cheaper and the agreed charge has to be considered as being an exceptional rate for this purpose, and has to be taken into consideration by the Tribunal in arriving at the standard revenue, obviously it is most important that the Railway Rates Tribunal should be able to take every one of those things into consideration to see what effect it will have on the standard revenue. There is a further point which shows how essential this Amendment is. When the Act of 1921 was passed the railway companies were not interested in auxiliary undertakings to anything like the extent they are to-day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the unpleasant task a few days ago of mentioning to this Committee the losses made by the railway companies on one of their auxiliary undertakings—cartage and delivery. They have very large interests in passenger road transport. All these things have an effect upon the standard revenue of the railway companies, and when there is the further question of these agreed charges coming into the account it is obvious that traders have very good grounds for apprehension unless there is an opportunity of putting their case forward. They do not want to be told by the Railway Rates Tribunal, "We cannot consider that point because we are not modifying charges." It is a reasonable thing that we are asking for—that traders should be allowed to put forward their case with a view to having charges modified without being told, "You cannot put forward your case until we decide to modify charges."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir HENRY CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not entertain this Amendment. When the Act of 1921 was passed provision was made which required a full dress inquiry on every rate made by a railway company with a view to fixing the standard revenue. That inquiry went on for months and months and entailed very heavy cost. The Act further provided that each year a review of the existing position was to be made by the Railway Rates Tribunal, but it is only to have a further inquiry such as there was before if it is proposing to modify the charges
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
then made. Since the slump in railway traffic the losses incurred by the railway companies have been so immense that the standard revenue has not been realised by, I think it is, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, though I do not like to give a figure, because I have not the exact amount before me. It has been so great that it has not been possible to put the Act into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The railway companies and everybody concerned have realised that the rates could not be increased to provide a standard revenue, and the result has been a general agreement to leave the existing rates where they are, although they are not achieving their object, which was to give a standard revenue to the companies. The only object of the proposed Amendment is to require a full dress inquiry into every charge made by the railway companies every year, although it is common ground that the charges cannot be modified and the rates cannot be increased. That seems to me unbusinesslike to the last degree. It cannot be one halfpennyworth of good to the road hauliers or to anybody else, and can only result in enormous waste of time and money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment very strongly, but from a different standpoint from that put forward by my hon. Friend. He moved the Amendment very largely from the point of view of the trading interests generally. I desire to support it more particularly from the point of view of the docks and harbour authorities. The Amendment does not seek to give any new powers to the docks and harbour authorities, but only to give effect to what it is clear was the definite intention of Parliament when the Railways Act, 1921, was passed. As to that there can be no doubt whatever. Why was Section 59 (6) of the Railways Act, 1921, inserted? I have taken the trouble to get from the Library a copy of the OFFICIAL REPOET of Standing Committee B which considered the Railways Bill. When one reads the speeches then made one finds that the argument was this, that unless some provision such as is embodied in Section 59 (6) was included, the Railways Act would enable the railway companies to subsidise, in effect, ancillary undertakings at the expense of those who were in competition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
with them. Consequently, this proviso was put into Section 59, namely, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rates tribunal, when modifying charges on any such review, shall have regard to the like considerations as when fixing charges in the first instance:</p></blockquote>
Now come the important words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the tribunal shall have regard to the financial results obtained from the operation of any ancillary or subsidiary business carried on by the company, and if satisfied that the net revenue resulting therefrom is, having regard to all the circumstances, unduly low, may, for the purpose of such review, make such deductions from the charges which would otherwise have been fixed as they think proper."</p></blockquote>
A distinguished predecessor of my hon. Friend, the then Minister of Transport, Sir Eric Geddes, used these words in his speech in support of that particular provision:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I received a deputation from the dock interests, accompanied by hon. Members, and they put this point to me. They said that before the War, with fixed statutory maxima, the railway companies could rely upon the receipts on the railway to enable them to subsidise in one form or another their steamship services, their docks, and possibly their hotels and other ancillary services. We always have objected to that. We never thought it was fair, but the position now is much worse, because we assume that, with falling costs and as rates come down, there will be a considerable margin between a fair and just rate, having regard to costs and remuneration on capital. The position would be that a railway company, desirous of pushing for good and proper reasons, so far as its own interests are concerned, its steamship undertaking or its docks, could say: 'Oh, well; it does not matter if I make a loss on that, because the whole of my undertaking, including all this ancillary service, is to get a revenue on a standard basis from the railway rates,' and therefore you would have a publicly-owned dock undertaking or a competitive steamship service being killed in competition."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, (	<i>Standing Committee B</i>), 11th July, 1921, cols. 1050–1.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A singularly inaccurate prophecy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. RENTOUL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not trouble the Committee further by reading more to elaborate the point, which was subsequently supported by the Attorney-General. That Sub-section was put into the Railways Act for the purpose of giving some protection to competitive undertakings, so that they would not be unfairly hit by the competition from railway-subsidised undertakings of a similar
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
character. That Sub-section has in fact been inoperative. It has not achieved the purpose for which it was included, because the words, "modifying charges," have been held by the Railway Rates Tribunal to preclude them from having regard to the financial results obtained from the operations of these ancillary businesses carried on by the railway companies, except when the charges are actually modified by them. Therefore, if no modification has taken place—and no modifications have taken place or seem likely to take place—the result is that, by what is a technicality, the purpose that Parliament had in view in inserting these words in the Act of 1921 has been largely nullified. This is not a new point. The Minister and his Department have, I understand, considered it on previous occasions, and I should be very surprised if the Minister is prepared to say that Section 59 (6) of the Railways Act is working satisfactorily in practice, and that some modification is not required on the lines comprised in the Amendment. For these reasons I very strongly support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOHN SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the suggestion made that every rate is going to be under discussion. That is rather a bogy. It is only certain questions that come up. The tribunal has to review certain things, and if you have the words, "modifying charges" brought in, you do away with the opportunity of reviewing matters which should be dealt with in the spirit laid down in the Act of 1921. In common fairness, this matter ought to be put in order. The words suggested in the Amendment would meet the case. The Minister may feel that the words go too far, but I am sure that he will realise that we are raising an important point and I hope that both he and the Committee will agree to some modification which will obviate the difficulty which exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not very much impressed by the extracts from the previous Debate which my hon. and learned Friend read. They seemed merely to prove to me that my predecessor, Sir Eric Geddes, although he may have been, and no doubt was, a good Minister, was an extremely bad prophet, because the whole of his argument was based on the assumption that the railway position was going
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
to be so good that the standard charges then to be fixed would in future bring in more than the standard revenue that was allowed. As everybody knows, the standard charges are completely inadequate to bring in the standard revenue, and no modification of those standard charges could possibly, in existing circumstances, result in providing the railways with their standard revenue. Therefore, it seems to me that any argument founded upon that discussion really fails of its purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister allow me to give him the figure for 1932? The net revenue of the railway companies was £26,425,000, and the standard revenue £50,933,000. It is only just over 50 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, the arguments that have been advanced in support of the Amendment have been purely theoretical, and I must confess at once that, on purely theoretical grounds, there is a considerable amount of substance in them, but I want the Committee, before we decide upon this question, to ask themselves what would be the practical result of the Amendment, because that is what we are chiefly concerned with in the Committee and, I hope, in the House. Who will be benefited by the passing of this Amendment? The only result, as far as I can see, is that certain interests would be able to launch an inquiry before a certain tribunal, which has already said that it did not see any use in such an inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must realise that if the tribunal believes that there is any possibility of a modification of the standard charges being of any use, it is in a position to conduct this inquiry and to hear the facts that may be put before it. The whole basis of the complaint of my hon. Friends is that the tribunal believes that there is no possibility of such a modification usefully being made and, therefore, saying, "If that possibility does not exist, we have not got to hold these inquiries." The Committee will see, therefore, that if the Amendment were accepted, it would only mean that a tribunal which already, from its knowledge of the general facts of the case, has made up its mind that this modification cannot be effectually made, will be forced to hold an inquiry into the particular
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
cases that may be brought before it. It seems to me that, whatever the theoretical argument may be, in practice it simply means that there will be a number of long and costly inquiries undertaken in circumstances which do not admit of any positive result whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I frankly admit that, on the theoretical side of the case, I am rather impressed by the arguments that have been advanced, and if my hon. Friends, either now, or at a subsequent stage, or in private, can convince me that any practical advantage can result to anybody from adopting this Amendment, I will certainly give it the most serious consideration; but if all that it is to mean is the holding, for no one's satisfaction, of long inquiries, which can in the circumstances end in nothing, I suggest that whatever the theoretical merits may be, both this Committee and the House would be ill-advised to give this opportunity for what might prove purely fruitless but expensive discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regretted to hear the Minister say that he would give this matter further consideration. His speech was conclusive that there is no probability of there being any justification for holding this annual review of all the rates, or that the railway companies will be able to subsidise any of their subsidiary industries, whether shipping or hotels or whatever it may be, at the expense of a surplus revenue which is so far from existing. I interrupted the Minister to show that the revenue last year was only just over 50 per cent. of the standard revenue, and that there is a deficiency of over £24,000,000. I think, for all practical purposes, the Committee ought to regard this as an Amendment which has no relation to the facts or to the purpose of the Bill. Therefore, I regret that the Minister did not decide to turn it down, here and now; and if it is pressed, I hope the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. ROBERTS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said. He seems to have only one fear, and that is of unnecessary expense and inquiries. I want to point out that I am striving to obtain in this Amendment what the Railway Rates Tribunal themselves said on 6th July last year, on page 256 of their report, namely:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P1I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have, as we were asked, considered whether, in the present circumstances, we should not apply the provisions of Section 58 (2). In our opinion, this Section, which embodies the considerations which it is useful we should have brought to our notice, can only be applied when the conditions of Section 59 (6) are fulfilled; that is, when charges are being modified."</p></blockquote>
It is obvious that the tribunal admits that there are considerations which would be useful to them and which should be brought to their notice. I have a further suggestion to make to the Minister, but of course I cannot move it now. I am sure that, if we were to take out the words on the Paper, "when modifying charges," from the particular place where they are in this Section, and move them three lines lower down, it would satisfy the Minister, the railway companies, and everyone else. If, as I understand, the Minister is prepared to receive representations as to a workable method of doing these things, I shall be very glad to see him, and to withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to what was said by the hon. Baronet the Member for Barnstaple (Sir B. Peto), I do not think anyone can say that I have been ungenerous or unmindful of the interests of the railways, but he evidently feels that I have been deficient in my duty, and he proposes to stiffen my backbone. I have no intention of receding from the position that I took up, namely, that I shall certainly resist this Amendment at every stage, if no practical advantages can be shown to result from it. I am certainly open, at this or any other stage, to have those practical advantages shown to me, but I would not admit of the mere useless holding of an inquiry in circumstances which, 	<i>ipso facto,</i> must lead to that inquiry ending in nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. ROBERTS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to press the Minister if I can avoid it, but this is of vital importance.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said so twice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have the pleasure and privilege of moving the last Amendment, which, for some reason or other, although it has been on the Paper for some days, has been taken off. I do not know how that came about. It seems to me that, if these words were inserted, the real purpose of the Bill would be more accurately and conveniently described.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. PARKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to associate myself, Sir William, with the hon. Baronet's expression of appreciation. By your persuasive and kindly manner you have very much lightened the work of the Committee. We know you, we have served under you, we have tried you, and have always found you to be true. You have always given satisfaction wherever it has been possible to do so, and have rendered great service to the Committee in the passage of the Bill. I should like also to express my appreciation of the Minister, who has gone a long way towards carrying the Bill to success. He has done all that he could to avoid recriminations in the Committee. He has given long explanatory statements where there has been difference of opinion or conflict upon Amendments. He has given many promises, which, of course, have yet to be realised, particularly from the point of view of those on our side. He has led us to what I think I might call the promised land, that is to say, the Report stage, and it is up to him, when we get there, to see that it contains such an amount of fruit, or whatever it may be, as will give satisfaction to most of the Committee. I hope we shall all agree on this, because in the Minister and the Chairman we could not have had a better pair working in harness to bring the Committee through its labours with graciousness and good feeling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

of the Committee, I should like to associate myself with the expressions of gratitude to you, Sir William, for the courtesy with which you have conducted our proceedings and which you have extended to all of us. If, as a result of our labours, we may hope to have improved the Bill, I trust that the Minister will consider that we have made his task a little more interesting and stimulating than otherwise it might have been, because it must be rather enervating to be in charge of a Bill of this kind unless it meets with adequate criticism. I would like to add this to my congratulations to the Minister. I do not know whether he will regard it exactly as a compliment or not, but I have had the privilege of serving on a good many Standing Committees, and have never had occasion to be filled with so much admiration for the skill with which the Minister has succeeded in giving so little away, in resisting a series of admirable Amendments moved by myself and others, and in bringing the Bill through Committee almost unchanged. Whether it will be better or worse for that, time alone will show, but we should like to congratulate you, Sir William, on the conclusion of your labours with the Committee, and the Minister on the ability, and, I may add, the determination, with which he has conducted the proceedings to the conclusion of the Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am informed that during the Committee stage we have dealt with 605 Amendments, which must have put a considerable strain at least upon your throat. I quite realise that the task of the Committee, in dealing with a Bill of this kind, might have been made quite impossible if there had been a real desire on the part of hon. Members to prevent its passage into law. Several hon. Members showed that they were not at all deficient in power, when they felt it right to use their eloquence, both as regards quality and quantity of speech, and, if that power had been used for the purpose of wrecking the Bill instead of amending it, its passage would have been made difficult, if not impossible.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, in saying, "Thank you," add that I have never presided over a Committee which has been more considerate; and I am very much obliged to you all for the kind way in which you have conducted yourselves,
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
making it very easy for me to conduct the business from the Chair. I should like also to pay a tribute to the Clerks, who have done their work very excellently indeed. I appreciate their services very much, and they are well worthy of any thanks that we may give to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
