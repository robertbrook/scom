<br><br><!-- lb -->
In framing these provisions for setting up a Health Council in Ireland, the Government has been most anxious to meet, as far as possible, the very strong representations which have been made from hon. Members from Ireland on all sides, and the desire which has been expressed—and in which the Government is in complete concurrence—that this council shall be a thoroughly effective institution for bringing into operation, as far as possible under present conditions, measures for improving the health of the people, and constituting a central body which will hereafter, as we hope—this being, as I said before, of an anticipatory nature—lead on to a thoroughly reformed public health system in Ireland. This is as far as we can go, having regard to existing Irish conditions, with a machine or portion of a machine, which we hope will be effective and real in its working during this transition period. In framing these proposals we have had before us the representations, as I say, of all the Members from Ireland on both sides, and I wish especially to acknowledge the assistance which we have got from my right hon. Friend on my left, and my hon. Friend (Sir K. Wood), who have given us every possible assistance in trying to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. I hope Members from Ireland will see that this is the very best we can do under existing conditions. You will see, in the first portion of our Clause, it shall be the duty of the Minister—that is, the Chief Secretary—just as it will be the duty of my right hon. Friend the President of the Local Government Board, when he becomes Minister of Health "to take all such steps as may be desirable" to improve the health of the people. So that exactly the same conditions are imposed on our Chief Secretary as are imposed on the Minister of Health for England—
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of giving advice and assistance, and making proposals to the Chief Secretary."</p></blockquote>
You will remember that in the White Paper, which embodies what is proposed to be the provisions relating to the consultative council, among some of the most important of these functions is that of "making proposals." That will give an initiative to the proposed council, and, accordingly, we suggest that not only for "giving advice and assistance," but for
	<br><blockquote><p>"making proposals to the Chief Secretary in connection with his powers and duties under this
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
Act, a council shall be established (which shall be called the Irish Public Health Council) consisting of the following persons:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) The Vice-President and the two other Commissioners of the Local Government Board for Ireland."</p></blockquote>
The whole administration, as I pointed out on the first day, is on the public side under the Local Government Board for Ireland, practically in all parts—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) The chairman and such two others of the Irish Insurance Commissioners as may be nominated by the Chief Secretary,"</p></blockquote>
That will enable a very full representation to be given to the Insurance Commissioners. As I mentioned before, we anticipate in a short time that we shall have the extension, which we have not at present, of medical benefits to Ireland under the Insurance system, and accordingly it has been thought desirable that at least three of those Commissioners should be members of this council. Then
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>c</i>) The Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages in Ireland;"</p></blockquote>
It is essential, of course, that the Registrar-General should be a member of such council. I think you had a debate here in relation to his position in England, and it was pointed out that he is really a portion of the Local Government Board here. He is not so in Ireland, and accordingly we include him for the purpose of giving statistics relating to health and other matters which are exceedingly well done in Ireland under his direction. The next proposal is
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>d</i>) A registered medical practitioner, who shall act as chairman of the council under the direction of the Chief Secretary, and three other registered medical practitioners, one of whom shall be a woman and one of whom shall be a medical practitioner who is registered on the Medical Register in respect of a diploma in sanitary science, public health, or State medicine;"</p></blockquote>
This is where we commence the non-official branch of the Council. Under (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) all the persons taking part in this council will be of an official character. Of course, there will be the Chief Secretary himself, and then there are the Vice-President and the two other Commissioners of the Local Government Board for Ireland. The Vice-President is Sir Henry Robinson, and no other man, I think, has an equal grasp of all matters connected with local legislation in Ireland, and the two other Commissioners, namely, the Medical Commissioners, who, I think all medical men—and I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Trinity College, who has an intimate knowledge of all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
medical matters in Ireland—will agree is a most excellent official, and that is. Dr. Coey Bigger. The other Commissioner is Mr. Burke, who is thoroughly familiar with all local associations. Then there are the Chairman and two others of the Irish Insurance Commissioners and the Registrar-General, making seven members, and with the Chief Secretary giving a representation of eight on the official side. Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) brings us to the non-official side. It is provided that a registered medical practitioner shall act as chairman of the Council, under the direction of the Chief Secretary. It has been thought desirable that we should have some person who is non-official who would be able to devote more attention to the work than the over-burdened officials could, and whose assistance would be called in to help the work of the council. It is better to have someone to devote himself exclusively to it and to be the convener of the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will there be a salary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SAMUELS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is intended that he should be paid a salary or remunerated in some adequate way. I cannot say the amount at the moment. There has been very little time to get in touch with the Treasury on the point as to how far we can go, but the desire is that he should be properly remunerated. With regard to the Chairmanship, one might suppose that the proper person to have as Chairman would be that very eminent administrator, Sir Henry Robinson, or possibly another very eminent and able official, Sir Joseph Glynn, the head of the Insurance Commission. But when we think what this work is going to be we see that it would be utterly impossible, however invaluable his services, to ask Sir Henry Robinson to devote the very great amount of time which will very probably have to be given to carrying out these particular reforms and anticipating what has to be done. I do not think he has any time for it. The wonderful thing is at the present time how everything is done so efficiently that comes from his hands. I do not think it would be possible for Sir Joseph Glynn to undertake the work, and we think it better to have a non-official gentleman who will make this his particular duty. What his proper denomination may be must be left to the future. At any rate he would act as Chairman, under the direction of the Chief Secretary. We ask also that there shall be six other persons having practical experience of matters relating or inci-
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
dental to or affecting the health of the people. This will give an opportunity of having the approved societies and the insurance bodies and others nominated and brought into touch with the council. I know there is a general feeling, and I know it is the wish of my hon. Friends from Ireland, that there should be such provision made. It would also be desirable to have persons who are acquainted with the non-medical side of public life in Ireland who will have to carry out through the medium of the county councils and the borough councils and other local bodies these health measures, and that they should have representation on the council. By providing six representatives in addition to the four medical members we shall get a consultative council of 10 non-official members, and we ought to get a very efficient council devoting themselves to this work. It is open for women to be members of this council. The Chief Secretary is from time to time to nominate persons who under paragraphs (	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>e</i>) are to be members of the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can women be members under paragraph (	<i>e</i>)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SAMUELS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and I hope we shall have the assistance of women. We provide, in the first place, that one of the medical practitioners is to be a woman. There is nothing to prevent women being nominated, and anybody who knows the great devotion of women for this work and the great efficiency with which they have worked, will realise that it will be a very defective council if they are not adequately represented on it. I am sure the representations which have been made from a great many Women's Councils, and accepted by men, also show that women are to have a proper representation upon the council. In regard to the Clause relating to expenses, it is provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The expenses of the Chief Secretary and of the Irish Public Health Council under this Act, including such remuneration of the medical practitioners who are members of that council as the Treasury may determine, shall be paid in like manner as the expenses of the Ministry."</p></blockquote>
It may be necessary for us to modify this, but I have not had sufficient time to get to know exactly the position of the Treasury in regard to it. I have no doubt they will give similar assistance in Ireland as in England, and having regard to the extremely persuasive appeal of the President of the Local Government Board with the Treasury, I think we might come in well under his wing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SAMUELS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we can get round under the President of the Local Government Board, the new Minister of Health, I think we shall do very well. At any rate, I hope the hon. Member for the Falls Division (Mr. Devlin) will keep his eyes open in the matter. I think we have done the best we could to meet his wishes as far as they have been expressed, and the Amendments put down by my hon. Friend, and although we may not all be satisfied, we will try to do our best for the present and better for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain. CRAIG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Unionist friends from the North of Ireland and myself desire to thank the Attorney-General very heartily for the way in which he has tried to meet our views in the matter of setting up a Health Authority in Ireland. The Committee will remember that at the end of the Second Reading stage of the Bill in the House an Instruction was passed directing this Committee to apply this Bill to Ireland. We took that to mean that the Bill was to apply to Ireland in as full a measure as it applies to England. I regret to say that the new Clause which was introduced by the Attorney-General a few days ago did not meet our views in that respect. We did not consider that it applied the Bill to Ireland in anything like the full way that it is applied to England. The new Clause now moved is a compromise. We naturally wanted to go further than the Attorney-General has been able to go. I would have liked to have had something in the nature of a Health Minister in Ireland. I do not see why it should be any more impossible to set up a Health Minister in Ireland than it was a few years ago to set up a President of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Ireland. We have that office in Ireland as hon. Members know. However, the Attorney-General informed us that that was practically impossible and that the Irish Government could not see their way to do it. We impressed upon him to the full that if the Bill was to be of the slightest use to Ireland we must have some individual whose sole duty it would be to take charge of the matter of public health and to prosecute it just as it will be the sole duty of the Minister of Health in England. If you simply set up the Chief Secretary for Ireland as Health Minister for Ireland it is. quite obvious that if he has to do these things himself they will
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
not be done, not because he is not anxious that the health of Ireland should be improved, but simply because he has a thousand other things to do, and unless he looked upon this as so important as to take precedence of everything else the work would never be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other alternative was to set up a Board. For reasons which I cannot myself see, the Irish Government insist that if a Board, which will have executive powers, were set up, it must include all these officials of the Local Government Board, the Insurance Commissioners and the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The same objection as held good in the case of the Chief Secretary applies to a Board composed largely of those gentlemen. That is, they have already got such a lot of work to do that they could not give up enough time to this question of health. Therefore, we had a conference with the Attorney-General. I do not think that he objects to my stating that this is the result, more or less, of a conference held since the last meeting of the Committee, at which my Friends, the other Unionist Members from the North of Ireland, and also a Member for one of the Divisions of Government, and, in fact, all Unionist Members from Ireland were represented. We came to the conclusion that the Chief Secretary should be the Health Minister for Ireland, but that besides him we should have some other individual appointed, whose duty it would be to give his whole time to this subject of health, and that that person should be distinguished by some name in the Bill. The name suggested was the Irish Health Commissioner, so that he should be a well-known entity, a person whose very description would let the world know what his duties were, and that while subordinate to the Chief Secretary, he should be the real health authority for Ireland, advised, of course, by a council. When we came to that conclusion, we were satisfied that an Amendment in that form would come before the committee, but I must say quite plainly, now that I see the Amendment, it does not represent exactly what I thought the conference had determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point was this: We said we are satisfied we have got a real live authority in Ireland to look after health. That is the person whom it was proposed to call the Irish Health Commissioner. That gentleman, who to my mind is the same person who is included in this Amendment,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
is hidden away in Sub-section D of the Attorney-General's Amendment. He is there referred to as a registered medical practitioner who shall act as chairman of the council under the direction of the Chief Secretary. I quite understand that the Attorney-General has had some difficulty with those gentlemen who are our masters in all these matters, that is to say, the Parliamentary draftsmen. I can see their hand there quite plainly. They will not allow us, for some reason or other, to say quite plainly, as we proposed, that there should be appointed also an individual to be called the Irish Health Commissioner to assist the Chief Secretary in the discharge of his duties as Irish Minister for Health. We wanted it stated perfectly plainly that there shall be an official to do all the work to be done in the name of the Chief Secretary, because the Chief Secretary has not the time to do it himself, and here he is hidden away in Subsection (	<i>d</i>). I regret very much that he is hidden away in this manner. I should like to have him staring us in the face. I do not think enough prominence has been given to this gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no views at the moment as to who is to fill this very important post. I am quite prepared to leave that to the Irish Government, but upon him the full success of the carrying out of this Bill in Ireland is based. It was only last night that this Amendment was completed. Perhaps I am wrong in putting the whole blame upon the Parliamentary draftsmen. I forgot to mention the other important body, the Treasury, whoever they are, standing between us and having that man appointed and put in his proper place in this category of persons here, and I would suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that before the Report stage he should reconsider the form of this Clause, so that this gentleman should be included in a more intelligible way than he is here and that it should be made absolutely clear to everybody that he is the principal authority in Ireland under the Chief Secretary, and that he is a separate and distinct entity from the Council. He is to be a salaried man, a whole-time man, while the Council is not to be a whole-time council. Subject to those remarks I agree that this Amendment, which is a compromise, comes very close to what we want in Ireland—that is to say, a real live body which will take a proper interest in the matter of health and give its whole time to it, and in view of the fact that Ireland
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
needs more attention in this respect than any other part of the United Kingdom to try to make up for lost time in the matter. I am quite sure that, when such an authority is set up, the improvement in health in Ireland will be visible in a very short time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. WOODS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Attorney-General for Ireland is to be congratulated on having done as well as he possibly could in a very difficult situation. A great deal of misapprehension exists not merely here but in Ireland with regard to what is possible under this Bill, and I think it might perhaps clear the air to say a few words as to how I regard it. What we are doing under this Bill is merely the beginning—the peg on which we hope to hang efficient and proper administration for Ireland in matters of public health. Such a thing as public health in any real acceptance of the term does not at present exist in Ireland, and the amount of work that must be done before such a service can be properly initiated is stupendous. All we hope to do under this Bill is to start the central authority under which afterwards powers will be sought, for the purpose of bringing in the mechanism by which the local authorities will have an opportunity of doing, and, if necessary, will be made to do, what is necessary for the public health of the country. That is a matter for subsequent legislation. Further statutory powers must be sought to enable that to be brought about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thing we were most anxious for, and which we have succeeded in obtaining here, was to ensure that the Health service for Ireland, instead of being relegated to an already overworked Department, should be placed under one central authority with some individual, or group of individuals, on whom the duty would devolve of making it a proper Health service. Under this Clause, I think we have obtained that, and while I expected, like the hon. Member who has just spoken, to see the registered medical practitioner who is the head and responsible man of the Ministry, at the top of the alphabetical list, I do not attach very much importance to his position there, for that, after all, is only a matter of form, and if he has got the power, and if on him the responsibility devolves, I do not care for my part whether he comes in in this Clause under A or Z. With these remarks I beg to express my approval of what we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
got. I think it is the best that could be done under the very difficult circumstances that exist in Ireland. It would not have been possible to start a Ministry of Health entirely free from the Local Government Board. There are an enormous number of Statutes, running, I believe, into hundreds, which bear on health in Ireland, and the only body in that country which is really conversant with them is the Local Government Board, so that we may have their help, directly or indirectly. I think we shall be able to obtain that here, and at the same time we shall have one man who will be able to devote his whole time and give all the attention that is necessary to these very complex and very important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. WHITLA</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to associate myself with the remarks made by my hon. Friend, and I desire to express my profound gratitude to the Attorney-General for Ireland for the Amendment he has put upon the Paper. Before I speak of this Amendment as a whole, I want to draw the attention of the right hon. Gentleman in charge of this Bill to Clause I in the Attorney General's Amendment. Here you have what I think is called an omnibus Clause. It sets forth the duties the Ministry will be expected to carry out. The Committee will remember a very important Amendment which it passed unanimously and appended to a Clause in the Bill providing that, amongst the other duties of the Ministry should be the initiation and direction of research work. This is not a matter of detail. It is a matter of vital principle, and it certainly should be inserted in the Bill, because without the aid of research the measure will be, I will not say a dead letter, but the effect will be to clog the wheels of progress in health legislation in Ireland. I, therefore, ask for the insertion of this Clause so that the duties already defined in the English Bill shall be copied into this extension for Ireland. I believe the Attorney-General has undertaken that this shall be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it is a question of policy for a section of Members in the House to express themselves as quite satisfied with the concessions that have been made to them, but I have no hesitation in saying that the extension of this Bill as it relates to Ireland is thoroughly satisfactory. There we are in a better position than you are in England, because we shall certainly be able to get to work very much sooner than will be possible for
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
the Ministry in England. We have a real live working council, which in Ireland will be able to do unbounded good work in the cause of health. I do not share the regrets of my hon. Friend with regard to the registered medical practitioner. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. I do not care what he is called. It has been suggested that his name should be inserted in this Bill. I think I know who it is to be; it will be the best man that Ireland can possibly produce, and I hold that opinion because I have absolute faith in the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General that they will make a good selection. I have great pleasure in supporting the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DEVLIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that hon. Gentlemen opposite are satisfied. I myself would have preferred, as I stated in the House, and as I stated in Committee the other day, that a Public Health Bill for Ireland should have been drafted in consultation with Irish medical opinion and formed opinion of all sorts in that country. But the House of Commons, acting upon the instructions of its masters, in all these Irish affairs, decided otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain CRAIG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who are its masters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DEVLIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yourself and your colleagues. Acting upon your instructions the House of Commons decided to include Ireland in the provisions of a purely English health measure. I have not in the slightest degree changed the convictions to which I gave utterance in the House that this is a most unsatisfactory way of dealing with a matter so vitally concerning the health of Ireland—not in the slightest degree, because if the inclusion of a Clause of this character can be so wonderfully satisfactory to hon. Gentlemen opposite and to the Irish Government how is it that the wise and canny Scot, who are the most admirable race in the world.—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh, oh!"]—perhaps I may be allowed to finish my sentence—who are the most admirable race in the world in judging what is best for themselves and I must pay them this tribute, that they are a race not only eminently capable of doing what is suitable for themselves, but capable also of taking charge of the destinies of other people—Scotland for health purposes is largely a part of England. The industrial conditions are the same, the economic conditions are the same; they are in close association with each other and the whole taste, life

	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
and temperament of the people are practically the same, outside the Highlands. Why, then, is it that Scotland will not have this Bill and demand that they should have a Bill to themselves? Scotland always gets what it wants, when it says what it wants. Ireland gets what it does not want when the minority in Ireland say that they want it. In this case it is done by this council, not because it is a good thing to include Ireland in the provisions of this Bill, but in conformity with the declared political policy that the only legislation which should apply to Ireland shall be that which is applied to England. They did not care whether it was good or bad; if it was applied to England it ought to be applied to Ireland. I am deeply and bitterly opposed to the solution of this health problem for Ireland by the inclusion in this Bill of a Clause dealing with Ireland. It will yet be seen by the Committee and the House of Commons that this is a very unsatisfactory method of working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stated to the Committee that since the minority in Ireland are the determining factor in all these things which affect the majority and, indeed, everybody in Ireland, the only thing for me to do was to make the best of a bad bargain. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear!"] Quite so. I therefore put down a series of Amendments on the Paper trying to make this evil transaction as virtuous as possible. I understand that this Clause is the result of the joint wisdom of the council of ten which met the other day, but I notice that it practically includes all the Amendments I proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. M'GUFFIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member was invited to be a member of that conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DEVLIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I should have made eleven and that would have spoiled it, because a council of ten is now the order of the day. I am glad that in my absence the gentlemen who went there agreed that my Amendments were very desirable, and that most of them have been incorporated in this Clause, except that there is a proposal that six other persons having practical experience of matters relating or incidental to or affecting the health of the people should be added. My proposal was that there should be a representative of the approved societies, a person to represent the Irish Insurance Committees, a member of the General Council of County Councils in Ireland, and a member of the Asso-
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
ciation of Municipal Authorities of Ireland. I want it specifically stated in the Bill who are the proper persons, outside the doctors, the Insurance Commissioners and the Local Government Board, who should constitute the additional members of this Consultative Council. I object altogether to leaving it in the hands of the Chief Secretary for Ireland to appoint these six persons. What does he know about Ireland? He will, as usual, take his advice from hon. Gentlemen opposite. I should like some real and tangible reason given why the Amendment I suggested has not been incorporated in this Clause, which is the outcome of the consultative wisdom of the council of ten. Did they not think that a person ought to be appointed to represent the Irish approved societies, which constitute nearly 750,000 of the adults in Ireland interested in public health and, in addition, informed by their experience in connection with the working of the Insurance Act of the needs that exist there? It would not be scientific opinion or official opinion in my judgment you will have too much scientific and official opinion. What you want is the opinion of the men and women who represent the toilers and the workers., the class of population for whom preeminently this Bill has been introduced. The class of people you want are those who direct the Insurance Commission and those who represent the approved societies, who will bring to bear their knowledge of the life, health, and necessities of health improvement and who will be able to give the knowledge they possess to guide whoever will have the controlling hand in this matter. Then I suggested that there should be a member of the General Council of County Councils in Ireland, that great body which represents agriculture in Ireland. Then I suggested a member of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, representing all the great municipalities of the country. That Association cannot be anathema to hon. Gentlemen opposite, because it is ably presided over by Sir Robert Anderson of Derry and is an organisation which has done a great deal of good in directing public opinion to the needs of the municipalities. These are all representative men. I want them included in the Bill and their names stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I agree with an hon. Member who has spoken from this side that one of these six persons ought to be a woman.

	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
If there is any public work in which women are profoundly interested more than men it is the question of public health. They are the custodians of health, especially of the younger generation. The children of the nation are the potential citizens upon whom the great fabric of nationhood, prosperity and health depends. We cannot have too many women upon commissions of this character. This is only a consultative body for the purpose of advising the Chief Secretary and guiding him, therefore the more valuable experienced and informed advice that can be tendered to him the better. It is a very appropriate change that the chairman of this body should be a doctor. One of the chief reasons why I was so strongly in favour of an Irish Bill was that I was under the impression—I think I was not under a wrong impression—that the conduct of health administration under the new Bill when it became an Act would be in the hands of the Local Government Board. I have said some very bad things against the Local Government Board. Some of them they deserved and some of them they did not. It is not because of the personnel of the Local Government Board that I objected to their being the health authority. The whole local government administration in Ireland is a stain upon the administration of the country, and if the administration of public health had been given either to the Local Government Board or to a board dominated by the Local Government Board the Irish people would not have touched it with a forty-foot pole. It has the taint of pauperism, which the Irish people, with their natural pride, resent. One of the great causes of the success of the Irish Insurance Act was that it freed the people from the taint of pauperism. One of the reasons why the Insurance Commissioners have been so popular is because, unlike the Local Government Board, they have kept themselves completely in touch with all those interests they are placed there to safeguard. I am therefore glad, if we are going to have a Health Ministry at all in Ireland, if we must suffer the limitation of being stuffed in as a Clause in an English measure, that the Local Government Board are not going to dominate it. We shall watch the progress of this business and see whether it is wise in attempting to deal with public health in Ireland. This is only a consultative body to draft a Bill for Ireland. We can then raise all
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
the points I have mentioned. In the meantime, as matters stand as they do, as we have no voice in the government of our own country, and nothing has yet been settled by the Government, the only thing we can do, if you force legislation upon Ireland, is to make that legislation as satisfactory as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir KINGSLEY WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are only just two points I want to mention, as I happen to have taken part in the conference yesterday with respect to two questions which have been put. The first is on the question of the designation of the Chairman of the Advisory Council. It is true it was suggested yesterday that his title should be that of a Commissioner. There are certain difficulties, legal and otherwise, in designating anybody by that title at the moment, but I am authorised to state that the Attorney-General for Ireland will consider that between now and the Report stage to see if anything possible can be done. On the question of the Advisory Council, and the question who the six people mentioned in the last paragraph of the Sub-section shall be, it was thought not to be perhaps the most proper and most convenient course to state that these six individuals should be representatives of particular associations. But I think the Committee can be assured that, for instance, so far as the Insurance Committees of Ireland, and the assurance approved societies are sanctioned they will have proper representation on this council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And also, of course, local authorities. And I hope myself it will be possible to find a woman on that council. I am sure it is the intention of the Irish Government to make this a real working council, and I can also state that it is generally recognised that this is only a first step in a new health effort in Ireland. I am also authorised to state that, on the question raised in connection with research, the Clause shall follow the English Clause, and the suggestions made by my hon. Friend will be adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. M'GUFFIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not often in the absolute unanimity with the hon. and learned Member for the Falls Division of Belfast (Mr. Devlin) in which I find myself this morning. I am persuaded that if Ireland had full representation in the House of Commons it might have had a separate Bill. Though legislation by bits is unsatisfactory, at the same time I cannot see why Ireland is not regarded as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
a special entity in this case, with a Bill specially devoted to itself. The Clause says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Six other persons having practical experience of matters relating or incidental to"</p></blockquote>
What interests or institutions they are to represent is the difficulty at the moment, and I do not think the Attorney-General so far has been very sympathetic with regard to that. I am sure that the industrial classes should have representation. The time has come when the industrial classes, whose children this Bill is specially set up to protect, will insist on having adequate representation on any body that is going to be appointed. There are many representative organisations of labour in connection with Ireland that might fairly claim to have representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a matter I raised before in Committee, and on which I was ruled out of order, and that is the question of veterinary surgeons. In my opinion they are a very important body, and a professional body whose status cannot be ignored in this matter. We all feel that the very bedrock of this question is the question of milk, and I think no men are more competent to deal with this matter than the veterinary surgeons. I would like, therefore, to have some assurance that, in the selection of this body, men whose judgment and experience are so necessary in guiding us in this matter should not be overlooked, and that adequate recognition should be given to the Irish Veterinary Association. It would be their duty to inspect the cattle for tubercular cases, and to see that the milk itself was free from those germs which are so insidious, and, in many cases, detrimental to the health of the people. I would press upon the Attorney-General the desirability of giving us an assurance that the representation of these men will not be overlooked in so far as it serves the general public interest. I want to say I am absolutely in accord with the hon. and learned Member for the Falls Division of Belfast in this matter with respect to Ireland, but we feel for the moment that we are on the horns of a dilemma. We were not likely to get a Bill for Ireland at the moment. There was not sufficient pressure to produce influence enough on the Government. I say it with all respect to my hon. Friend. We had not sufficient influence to do that. I do very much regret that there has not been a special Bill for Ireland. Had we the pluck and tenacity of the Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
race, in all probability we would have got it. But, even if the provisions are of a temporary nature, now that they are to be set up, we are all hopeful that the best result will be achieved, and I am very glad my hon. and learned Friend is so much in sympathy with the prosecution of this measure to a successful end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. WHITE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely in agreement with the hon. and learned Member for Belfast. There are six other persons to be appointed. Is there any reason why four of them should not be the ones mentioned by the hon. Member for Belfast. Surely we should have here, at any rate, some degree of popular representation, instead of pure nomination by a man who has not been in Ireland above two months. I want us to come back to that if we can. I do not know whether it is possible to include these four in the six mentioned here, but surely it is worth the attempt. After all, I suppose most of us claim to be democrats, and I want to see the people as directly represented as possible on this very important council. I would like to ask the Attorney-General whether it is not even possible now to say exactly whether of four people nominated, at any rate, by bodies popularly elected, two must be elected by the people themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain CRAIG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust the Attorney-General will not alter his mind on this matter. The question of whether these six places should be filled by representatives of certain bodies in Ireland has, of course, been considered by everybody who has considered this Clause at all, and personally I feel that, with the number of bodies in Ireland who would demand and expect representation on this council, it is infinitely better to leave the matter to the unfettered discretion of the Chief Secretary, who, we may be perfectly certain, will give the proper representation to such boards and associations as have been mentioned in the Debate. I sincerely trust the Attorney-General will not alter his mind on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir ALFRED WARREN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to tie the Attorney-General's hands on this matter too tightly, but I do want to join in the plea made to him as to proper and adequate representation in respect to the six persons appointed. It has been quite rightly said that we profess to be democratic, and the rising generation will demand that in these matters of social reform they shall have proper representation upon the bodies that may be set up.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
Now the hon. Member for the Falls Division quite rightly pointed out that, whilst this would be largely composed of medical men—and rightly so—there would be other interests to serve, and I make a plea on behalf of the large number of those composed in the approved societies who have a very practical knowledge of what they really want. It will not mean medical treatment always. It will mean a hundred and one things that have to do with the people, and these men and women—as I hope some women will be included in the six—coming up from amongst the people will have a very intimate and thorough knowledge of a large number of things that affect the lives, interests, and health of the people, which perhaps do not always come quite within the purview of medical men. Although I do not want to carry the Attorney-General any further than he in his judgment deems it wise to go, I am sure that after what has been said in this Committee due regard will be paid when these appointments are made to the plea that has been heard here for a thorough, an adequate, and a satisfactory representation, because the success of this measure will very largely depend upon how persons are satisfied that a right and proper representation is included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. MURRAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Attorney-General replies, I should like, if I am in order, to ask a question which arises on the phraseology of the Clause. The phrase is that which lay on the Minister a duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take all such steps as may be desirable to secure the effective carrying out."</p></blockquote>
It appears to me that "effective carrying out" raises the question of the personnel of administration. I do not want to make any suggestions against or any criticism of the Civil Service, which requires no praise from me or this Committee, but I feel that the work of this Department, whether in Ireland or in England, is bound to be of an extremely technical character. Therefore I wonder whether the Government has considered the filling of all the administrative posts in the ordinary Civil Service way, or the supplementing of those methods by bringing in men who may have the technical fitness and attainments for this work, which could not be guaranteed in men who had merely passed the higher grade examinations of the Civil Service. It appears to me that some measure of medical and scientific knowledge may be necessary, not only in the members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
higher council and consultative bodies, but those who have to carry on the day-to-day administration of the work, and on whose ability the day-to-day success will depend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause accordingly read a second time.</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause be added to the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SAMUELS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to thank the Members of the Committee for the reception they have given to our proposal. The suggestions which have fallen from different hon. Members will, I am perfectly certain, be carried into effect when we are setting up this council. My lonely friend from the Falls Division (Mr. Devlin)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DEVLIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a bit lonely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SAMUELS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to certain representations he made it would appear as if he had no influence. He had a dynamic influence by his Amendments on the Paper, and certainly we did adopt to a very great extent and were bound to adopt the very valuable suggestions he made. As pointed out by my hon. and gallant Friend (Captain Craig) it would not be satisfactory to state here the names of the six persons. We want to have a certain elasticity in regard to the composition of the council, and that is why we have largely, if not mainly, adopted the suggestion of my hon. Friend, the Member for the Falls Division, to have six instead of three as originally intended. If we give a certain amount of elasticity, the suggestions made by the hon. Members, and the hon. Members for Derbyshire, Edmonton, and Leeds, will receive the fullest consideration, and I hope we shall have a full working and satisfactory council. I think it would be most unsatisfactory to suggest names here or to suggest the representatives of interest. In this respect I would adopt the views of the right hon. Gentleman (Dr. Addison) who set his face like flint against the representation of any particular interests, because if you do that you will have them round like bees and hornets. I can assure the hon. Member for the Shankhill Division that his suggestions will be carefully considered, but I cannot give any undertaking in regard to these matters now. The hon. Member for Belfast University called attention to the fact that in the new Clause as

	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>

I understand that the Government want to make a statement in regard to the new Clauses as a whole, and I do not want this Clause of mine torpedoed. If the right hon. Gentleman (Dr. Addison) could make a statement now it would help the Committee very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PRESIDENT of the LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Dr. Addison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be glad to have an opportunity of making a statement in regard to the general scope and intention, so far as I can discern it, of the new Clauses, and upon the principles which, so far as I am concerned, ought to guide us in considering the new Clauses. The members of the Committee are aware that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
general purport of the Bill is to set up this single Ministry with powers as specified in the Bill or in the Acts, the administration of which may be transferred to the Ministry. As such we have deliberately framed it, and in the course of our discussion the Committee has in general been in agreement with the policy that we should keep legislative matters relating to the alteration of existing local health services or local administrative bodies apart from this Bill, because, as I have said on several occasions, we propose as the next stage in the development of our health policy to submit to Parliament proposals relating to these matters of, I hope, a very far-reaching character. It is quite clear that to deal with pieces of local administration, or to add items of a particular set of powers in connection with one matter or another, will be dealing with the matter in a piece-meal and not in a satisfactory way. If we consider the question of tubercle, we want proposals, for instance, to deal with tubercle as a whole so far as we can, and to discuss them as a whole. The same applies to other topics. For that reason, while I am in cordial agreement with the intention of most of the new Clauses, I must say that this is not the appropriate measure in which to deal with them. We have given a pledge on behalf of the Government that we intend to make proposals regarding all health matters as soon as we can after the establishment of the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Clause which has been formally moved now to give me this opportunity of speaking is an excellent illustration of the general contention which I am endeavouring to put before the Committee. This new Clause suggests that the Ministry should have certain powers in respect of the grading of milk, requiring the delivery of milk in sealed bottles and things of that sort. I daresay that is very important. I have spent some time lately on material which has been prepared mainly by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary (Major Astor), who has spent a great deal of time on the milk question, but personally I am not at all satisfied that whilst this may be important it is the complete story of the powers we ought to take for dealing with milk. It is clear also that other Departments, such as the Ministry of Food and the Board of Agriculture, are concerned. We have in respect of milk a medley of powers which it is our business to disentangle as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
soon as we can. This new Clause would confer upon the Minister of Health a section of powers in regard to milk whilst at the same time the Board of Agriculture and the Food Ministry have certain other powers in regard to milk. I suggest the proper way to deal with the matter is to submit proposals for dealing with it as a whole and to decide who is to deal with it, and what their powers are to be. The Committee is also aware that there are certain powers under the Milk and Dairies Act which was passed just before the beginning of the war, and which is now to some extent suspended in its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These remarks apply to practically all the new Clauses. There is one Clause which refers to the power of the Ministry to dispose of money. When Parliament makes a grant of money the Minister is thereby authorised to dispose of that money in accordance with the instructions of Parliament when it makes the Grant. That remark applies to two of the new Clauses. There are other Clauses in respect to the Poor Law and voluntary hospitals. That again is a section of our public health work, and we cannot take a little piece out of the Poor Law and deal with it here now. We must submit proposals for dealing with the Poor Law in a comprehensive and proper way. It is quite clear that the medical part of the Poor Law, the Poor Law infirmaries, is the most difficult part of the Poor Law to disentangle from the rest, and it is our first duty, as we are already pledged to get along with that business. I suggest that the proper way to do it is to do it as a whole, and not by dealing with a section of it in this Bill. I hope hon. Members who put down these new Clauses will not think that I am in any way hostile to their intentions. I submit that my remarks apply to practically all the new Clauses. I thank the Committee for giving me the opportunity of making this statement, and on the grounds I have put forward I am afraid I shall have to object to the Clause moved by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to express my thanks to the right hon. Gentleman for the pledge he has given, and not least for the part of it which shows that he is not in any way in opposition to the object which my hon. Friend and the other hon. Members have in drafting and putting down these new Clauses. There is hardly one of them that is not well worth prolonged and acute Parliamentary discussion
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
at the proper time. They vary obviously in the multitude of their objects, in their scope, and in their incidence upon local government, as well as upon the central government which is involved in them. But why I rise now is not only to thank my right hon. Friend, but to say why many local authorities, at any rate, are very anxious that these things should not be proceeded with here. The Parliamentary Committee of the County Councils Association met yesterday afternoon and we were unanimously of opinion that these matters should not be dealt with in connection with this Bill. I do not know if that applies to the very important Clause here about making provision for the care and early treatment of uncertifiable cases of mental disease, which have very little relation to local government. But in most, if not all, of these Clauses there is raised the issue between the central authority and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities, no doubt, want tuning up, stimulating, and more control exercised over them. On the other hand, it is only fair, when these problems of local government are raised, that the local authorities should have an opportunity of conferring with the Minister informally before a Bill or Clauses are brought in, and certainly before they are finally decided on. That is from the point of view of local administrators, who have every sympathy with these objects and are quite prepared to take on more duties if Parliament so desires and loyally and sympathetically carry them out, but who ask that these things should be discussed in relation to the whole problem, and adequately, and that the relations between the central government and the local authorities should not be added on to a Bill the object of which is the creation of the central authority, especially at a time when preliminary and most valuable consideration cannot be given to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RAW</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of those who have put down Amendments, I regret that the right hon. Gentleman has made this decision, because, although we all acknowledge that he is just as much and as sincerely interested in the objects of these Amendments as we are, yet we feel that there was no opportunity in the discussions on the Bill as a whole to raise these points, and such opportunity would have been given by moving these special Clauses. This Bill attracted very great attention throughout the country, chiefly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

because it proposed to carry out the great reforms mentioned in these Clauses, and the country would be greatly disappointed indeed if we did not deal with such great questions as the milk supply, the separation of the Poor Law from voluntary hospitals, the subsidising of voluntary hospitals, and the creation of the whole hospital system on a uniform and more democratic basis, which is a very urgent reform to which the whole country is looking forward anxiously. I am not going to raise any political issues here, but in my constituency there was a burning desire that these questions should be embodied in the Ministry of Health Bill itself, and if the right hon. Gentleman is going to offer any opposition to these Clauses being discussed in Committee, I willingly withdraw them, so far as I am concerned, on condition that we have an assurance from the right hon. Gentleman that these urgent questions shall be dealt with at the very earliest possible moment in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need mention only one or two of these questions. Take tuberculosis, which is killing 60,000 people a year in this country. Everybody is anxious that a comprehensive scheme should be undertaken by the Government to stamp out this disease, which, after all, is a preventable disease, and ought not to be here at all. Another great question is that of the milk supply. People do not drink milk to any great extent in this country, because they are afraid of it. Milk to-day is a very dangerous thing to drink, and if people are to drink milk some thorough effort should be made to make it more free from the active germ of tuberculosis than it is at present. The other question which I should like to bring forward is the urgent necessity for the treatment of early cases of mental disorder without having to be certified under the Lunacy Acts. I do not know if the right hon. Gentleman would include that, in the scope of the Health Bill, but I think that every member of the Committee will agree that early mental disorder is just as much a question of health as the person who has got bronchitis. At present the treatment of early mental disorder is most unsatisfactory. People who get a temporary breakdown have either to be certified under the Lunacy Acts or have to go without the necessary treatment which is so desirable. I understand that a Bill is to be brought forward on behalf of the authorities dealing with these questions. I hope sin-
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
cerely that this question will not be lost sight of by the Minister in charge of this Bill. I repeat that I am bitterly disappointed that these questions are not to be considered by this Committee, but if the right hon. Gentleman will give a distinct pledge that we shall have an opportunity of discussing these reforms at a very early date I will bow to the decision of the Chairman and withdraw my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to withdraw this Amendment, but I want to move the next Amendment and say something in reply to my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to endorse the remarks which fell from the hon. Member (Lieut.-Col. Raw) as to the disappointment felt in the country that the Ministry of Health Bill is merely a coordinating measure and does not give the necessary powers to local health authorities. Co-ordination is a most excellent thing, but unless additional powers are given to local authorities it would be received with a great sense of disappointment. I would urge the President of the Local Government Board to give not merely an expression of sympathy—which we know is real—but to give a pledge that during the present Session a Bill will be introduced, I do not say covering the whole of the powers which local authorities require to improve health conditions, but we should have the more urgent ones. If we wait until we get a perfect measure it will mean delay for a considerable time. Local authorities are ripe for, and are asking for, powers to be embodied in a general Bill. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give a pledge that in the present Session of Parliament he will introduce a measure to extend the work done by local authorities in many matters outside this Bill, which is merely a coordinating Bill, and in a sense does not increase the effectiveness of health administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain CRAIG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister in charge of this Bill will stick to his guns in this matter. I will go further and say, that if he entertains any of these Amendments which we are discussing at the present moment, it would be almost committing a breach of faith. It was perfectly well understood and agreed to by the House of Commons that this should be a machinery Bill, simply setting up a health authority, and if the Minister in charge of the Bill was for a moment to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel WEIGALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One aspect of this matter is the milk supply. I have been deputy-chairman for more than a year of the Milk Committee under my hon. Friend (Major A star) who is Chairman. So far as the whole milk supply is concerned my hon. Friend opposite has in view, the first Clause, and in reference to the disappointment expressed by my other hon. Friend let me remind him that the Milk and Dairies Act, 1915, has never been put into operation. It is open to the Government to-day, without asking for further legislation, to make regulations under that Act which will carry the matter a long distance in the way my hon. Friends desire. Apart from that, I would like to associate myself with my hon. Friend (Sir R. Adkins) who spoke for the County Councils Association. This is so big a question from the point of view of the producer, the distributor, and the consumer of milk, that we cannot hope to deal with it satisfactorily unless we deal with it comprehensively. Last night in the House we were carried a long stage further, owing to the announcement that the Government intend to create a Department responsible to the producer, to make it a first-rate Department with a Cabinet Minister, and to give it first-class rank, status and accommodation on the same lines as the Health Ministry, so that when these questions come up you will have to allocate them between the Government Department looking after the interests of the producer and the Government Department looking after the interests of the distributor and the consumer. They are all on the same plane. That will not be an easy matter. For these reasons I do beg hon. Members to accede to the wishes of my right hon. Friend and postpone this to a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. BRAMSDON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join most heartily in the suggestion that these various matters, referred to in the Amendment, should be postponed and dealt with hereafter by the Ministry when the Bill has been passed. I take it from his remarks that he is in sympathy with the various points, and I would ask him whether, as soon as this Bill has been passed, he would consider the advisability of setting on foot inquiries as to the best way of carrying
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
these things speedily into law. One particular point in which I am interested is the mental question as affecting persona who are unfortunately certified under the present law and are confined, in my; opinion, often when they ought not to be confined. I would ask whether the Government cannot set up a Joint Committee, a Departmental Committee, or a Royal Commission, to inquire into the whole of the lunacy laws. They are very antique, and they are in many cases very unjust. People are, in my opinion, confined in a. most perfunctory way by perfunctory orders, and altogether the whole thing-requires to be considered and dealt with. And if these laws are to be taken over—if the administration of them is to be taken, over—by the Minister of Health as contemplated here, I should hope that some inquiry in the nature of a Royal Commission will be instituted into the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only desire to say one word, and that is to support the position taken up by the President of the Local. Government Board that it would be inadvisable to encumber this Bill with the various new Clauses which have been suggested by hon. Members. The new Clauses in question do not exhaust all the subjects that might be included in such a, Bill as this, and I think we must be satisfied to take the Bill as it stands, trusting to future legislation to do what it can to-bring about objects which have the full sympathy of the President of the Local Government Board and many of which are indeed most desirable. For instance, take the matter referred to by the last speaker. It certainly requires a Royal Commission, or Departmental Committee to go into the whole question before any satisfactory legislation can be submitted. I simply rose, therefore, to express my desire that the Bill as it was introduced may be accepted and speedily passed into law. It would tend very largely to delay the passing of the Bill if we had to consider separately the various new Clauses which have been put on the Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Major Astor)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the remarks which have been made by the hon. Members who have spoken during the last 10 or 15 minutes, show there is a general agreement in the Committee that my right hon. Friend is quite right in sticking to the principle that this is a co-ordinating Bill. That was the principle agreed to by the House of Commons. In regard to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
whole of the matters dealt with in the new Clauses which have been placed upon the Paper, it is not proposed, in fact, to give any new powers to the local authorities. The Bill does not touch the local authorities at all, and I am perfectly certain that if we were to attempt to deal with such matters as consumption, milk, and the registration of nurses we should come to the conclusion that it would be advisable not to deal with them in one Bill, but to draft a large number of Bills to deal with these various subjects. I understand that tomorrow there is to be brought before the House of Commons a Bill dealing with the registration of nurses, and that it consists of from 20 to 30 Clauses. Obviously it is impossible for us to deal with the subject here in one Clause embodying a general reference. Then again, take the question of milk. At the present moment we are trying to see the extent to which the existing powers conferred on the Department by the Milk and Dairies Act, 1915, can be utilised. We do not know, in fact, to what extent they can be used, and it is only after examining that Act that the Minister who is responsible can come to Parliament and ask for additional powers. There is, further, the question of the blind. We have in draft a Bill of 15 Clauses dealing with facilities for assisting that section of the population, and I suggest it is unwise merely to have a reference to the blind in association with the sick, the lame and the poor. It would not deal adequately with the question and it might prejudice the consideration of this most important and most necessary subject. Take again the question of Poor Law. That will have to be gone into with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I need only repeat what my right hon. Friend has in his mind, and the undertaking which he has given, both in the House and to the Committee, that no time will be lost in considering the various aspects of these questions. Some of them, as a matter of fact, are already under consideration, and some will be referred to the various consultative councils for their opinion when they are set up. If we were to attempt to deal with these matters partially, by piece-meal, and inadequately, now, we should only delay the passage of this Bill, and we should delay the introduction of measures dealing more adequately than we can possibly attempt to do in the manner proposed. Therefore, while all
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
these matters have the complete sympathy of my right hon. Friend we feel it would be much better to leave them to be dealt with by subsequent legislation in what we called the second stage than when we were introducing this particular Bill. I think I am expressing the feeling of the majority of the Committee when I say there is a general agreement that that would be the most satisfactory way of dealing with these most important subjects which have the entire support, sympathy, and approval of my right hon. Friend but which cannot, in his opinion, be adequately dealt with in the manner suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite evident it is the general opinion of the Committee that these specific questions should not be dealt with now.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause does not deal with any particular question of health, but it certainly seems to me to be vital in principle. I rather think my right hon. Friend will agree that under this Bill we deal with the Local Government Board. If he will read the title of it he will see that it is "a bill to establish a Ministry of Health and a Board of Health to exercis…. powers with respect to health and local government." Under this Bill the Ministry of Health takes over the whole of the powers of the Local Government Board. Clause 2 reads—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Minister to take all such steps as may be desirable to secure the effective carrying out"</p></blockquote>
of these proposals. My contention is that under this Bill the Minister is simply transferring local bodies from the Local Government Board to himself. He is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
taking any more powers. But in the past a great many of these local authorities have been very recalcitrant and very backward indeed, and, so far as I can see, under this Bill he is not taking any additional powers to bring pressure to bear upon those local authorities which will not move. That is the real point of this new Clause, and I think I can make out a very good case for it. My right hon. Friend has printed his Housing Bill, and I find that he is there taking, in respect of housing, which after all, is a health measure, just as much as this is—he is there taking power if the local authorities do not move forward with any scheme they have undertaken, to take the scheme out of their hands and charge them with the expense of completing it. Therefore this new Clause is simply a suggestion that the right hon. Gentleman should take the same powers under this Health Bill as he proposes to take under his Housing Bill. This is a most important Amendment. I feel more strongly about it than about any other Amendment to the whole Bill. The Local Government Board the other day published its 47th Annual Report and in that document I find it is admitted that there are "some local authorities which have not made arrangements for nursing assistance in severe cases of measles, although that disease has been compulsorily notifiable since the 1st January, 1916." It is also shown in connection with the outbreak of small-pox in London in March, 1918, that the Local Government Board had to write to certain sanitary authorities requesting them to exercise their powers under the Board of Health regulations. Again, on the subject of maternity and child welfare, the report shows that Camberwell and Gateshead, where there is a heavy infantile mortality, were a long time uninterested, while Hampstead and Peterborough had made no provision whatever. This Clause simply says that if the local authorities refuse to make use of the grants which my right hon. Friend makes to them within a reasonable time, he shall have the power to carry out the schemes himself and to charge the local authorities with them. I do not want to keep the Committee for any length of time. If we can get this point settled before one o'clock, I take it we shall then adjourn, but I feel very strongly on this question and I shall divide the Committee upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree, and I will endeavour to follow the hon. Member's
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
example and be very brief. But he has raised a very important question of public policy in this proposal, with which, as far as its general intent is concerned, I have a good deal of sympathy. I believe everybody wants to get things done, and the illustrations which the hon. Member gave were very appropriate and forcible. Really I feel it is a tribute to the general conception of the Ministry that he should wish to give us these unique and unprecedented powers, especially those embraced in the last five words of this Clause, which I do not want to cavil at. But I suggest that the proper way of dealing with this thing is the one he referred to as embodied in the Housing Bill. In that Bill, we set out certain proposals in connection with housing, and it is proposed that in the event of the local authorities failing to do their duty, we should provide the means of doing it ourselves and charge them with their proper share of the expense, or in other words, see that the intention of Parliament when they make grants for anything is carried out. I entirely agree with my hon Friend that in times past we have suffered very much from a lot of these things being purely permissive. If we are going to get these problems properly dealt with, it must be on the lines indicated in the Housing Bill, and I should have no hesitation, I can assure my hon. Friend, in the proposals that we shall submit in connection with the various services of health, in acting on the general principle which is embodied in his Clause, except that I would not venture to suggest to Parliament that I should have quite such freedom of action as he proposes here. I am afraid I am not sanguine enough to think that either Parliament or the Treasury would give it me if I asked for it, because this Clause practically gives the Minister power to do what he likes with the money that the local authorities do not spend. The hon. Member's intention is that if, for instance, we provide money for the establishment of centres for the treatment of venereal diseases, we should see that those centres are established, and that, of course, is the right thing to do. I say here again, when I present to Parliament the proposals which I hope very soon to do for dealing with these various health questions, we must deal with the powers of the Ministry with regard to the local agencies in that measure just as we have done in the Housing Bill, otherwise we shall land our-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
selves in very serious difficulties. I do not expect that the hon. Member adheres particularly to the wording of his Clause, which, of course, gives the Minister far greater powers than Parliament would sanction. I am certain it would only allow him, for instance, to devote the money to the purpose for which it was voted. That is a detail. His intention is quite clear. I suggest to him that the best way of dealing with it is as my hon. Friend suggested. We are in full sympathy with his intentions, as we have indicated in the Housing Bill already laid before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend (Mr. Locker-Lampson), with whom I have voted, I think, on every occasion while this Bill has been in Committee, will not think me impertinent if I respectfully ask him not to press this proposition to a Division. What he wants is what I want, and what every member of the Committee wants, that where money is assigned by Parliament to a Government Department for a specific object, working through a local authority, if that local authority does not do the work properly, then the Department itself, through some other local authority or direct, should spend the money given them by Parliament on the object for which it was given. We are all agreed on that, but if this Clause here and now is pressed to a Division it will easily lend itself to quite unintentional misrepresentation. It will look as if those who do not vote for this want to excuse the local authorities when we do not want to excuse them. It will look as if we might be represented as being slack in our anxiety to get things done, whereas, as the right hon. Gentleman has pointed out, you can only get this done in careful and close connection with the specific powers given by Parliament and assigning and allocating to them the particular duties. More than that, there is a variety of local authorities. It may well happen that some minor local authority will not do its duty. There then arises a very important administrative point, whether that duty ought to be performed direct from London or by a larger local authority. A Government Department certainly ought to have the power to put alternatives in a Bill as they have done in the Housing Bill. I would therefore appeal to my hon. Friend not, by means of this Clause, with the intention of which everybody agrees, to hamper and confuse the various ways in which alone
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
it can be carried into effect and by which I trust it will be carried into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that the words of the new Clause are not the best to carry out my hon. Friend's object, but I wish to impress upon the Committee that they do enshrine a very important ideal. I do not think that the President of the Local Government Board has quite dealt with the whole size of the case. The case my hon. Friend has in mind is this: use your grants for the purpose of securing the best results from your local authorities; use them for the purpose of bringing slack local authorities up to the level of the efficient local authorities. It is all very well to say you can only do this in the individual Bill. It may be so. If it is so, that would be a very partial result, for the reason that I want the power to extend beyond the individual Bill. It is no answer to say that under the Housing Bill the Local Government Board has power to step in and do the work. I want to see a graded system, whereby the grants are given in certain cases by way of block grants to the larger local authorities, and they should have the power of apportioning them out to the smaller authorities and consequently should have the power of stopping a grant where the work is not efficiently done. It is a very important matter. Just because health is much bigger than any of the individual Bills like the Housing Bill, or the Nursing Bill, or the Bill for the Education of the Blind, just because the health service comprehends all these, the Minister wants some power of this sort. He wants a power that is wider than can be given by a single Bill. He wants to use all the power of the purse for the purpose of securing a uniform standard. Let the Committee never forget that here we are doing nothing for health. All that we are doing is to enable the Ministry to start local authorities at work who will have care of our health. Unless you give him the means of bringing those local authorities up to concert pitch, I do not believe you will do very much. This is a piece of machinery that we can very well give to the Minister. It does not interfere with the local authorities. It simply encourages the good ones and discourages the bad ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am going to make a practical suggestion. I am not sure that my hon. Friend has chosen the best words, but the Government might well consider the matter. After all, it is in their own interest. The words might be both wider and narrower
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
than the Amendment. They might be wider in giving the Government power to withhold a grant from a service which was not efficiently done. I do not think they would have that power under these words. Then the discretion to the Minister, as proposed, is given in rather too wide terms as to the distribution of grants. But could not this matter be considered between now and the Report stage? All the committee or a large number of the committee want something of this sort in the Bill, because they feel that unless we have something of this sort we shall get back to the old separate departments, and even though they are all centred in the President's breast they will be separate still. What we want is exchange and co-ordination, so that the money which is not used for one purpose is applied to another cognate purpose. I feel sure that unless we have something of that sort in this Bill, although we shall have done a great deal, we shall not have done all we can. I gather that the right hon. Gentleman is inclined to consider this favourably. Perhaps he will reconsider it—without a pledge, of course—between now and Report, and perhaps he will be able to bring up some words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. WHITE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that the hon. Member (Mr. Locker-Lampson) will go to a Division on this Clause. I have only been in the House of Commons since 4th February, yet I have never heard so many sympathetic expressions in such a short space of time without any result coming from a great many of them. I want something to happen with regard to this matter. If there is one man in the Government I could trust who is not a political strategist it is the President of the Local Government Board. If he will give us a definite pledge that these things which we are prohibited from discussing here to-day shall be attended to at the first opportunity, possibly I might reconsider my vote, bat I want a definite pledge. There is another most important matter with regard to the subsidy for the labour of consumptives. Am I to be told that a Committee on the Ministry of Health Bill is not the body to consider such a matter and make recommendations? I am not an old Parliamentary hand, but I want to see something done. On the last occasion I gave the concrete instance of a hairdresser who went to a sanatorium. He was discharged, the disease was arrested,
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
but he was told that if he wanted to live he must obtain outdoor employment, which he was utterly unable to do. I am told that there is no money out of which he can be assisted while learning some outdoor employment. There ought to be. May I give the Committee my own testimony? My daughter suffered from consumption. She is a teacher. She came home. I was not a Member of Parliament then, consequently I was a little better off and was able to keep her at home for 12 months and have her specially treated. She was discharged and the disease was arrested. Inheriting some of her mother's pluck, she learned an outdoor employment and is now working on forestry in the Chilterns. I want everybody else and everybody else's child to be assisted in that way. I want to put the matter in the hands of the President of the Local Government Board who, I hope, will be Minister of Health, so that he may be able to do something. I should like to see this proposal go to a Division so that we can express our opinion upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the principle of the Amendment. With all respect to the President, it does not give any new powers whatsoever. It merely ensures that those powers which exist at the present time in the hands of local authorities but which are not being exercised shall be exercised. As the hon. Member who moved it said, similar powers are outlined in the Housing Bill. That Bill confers new powers. The powers which we are transferring by this measure to the Ministry of Health are powers which already exist in the hands of the local authorities. There is the question of infantile mortality. The ravages of infantile mortality in our large towns are appalling. Some local authorities are using the powers they have, but some others are not doing so. If this Clause were carried the Local Government Board could step in and compel the work to be done which local authorities are at present neglecting. There is no more important question before the country at the present time than this question of infantile mortality. I hope that the President will give an assurance that, not perhaps these particular words, but the principle will be accepted, so that where a delinquent authority is not carrying out the powers entrusted to it, the Local Government Board will see that the work is done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the general feeling of the Committee is a desire that when money is voted by Parliament it should be used and for the purpose for which it is voted, and that the tiling shall not be brought to naught by some authority or other declining to act. In that I agree. When Parliament votes money, it votes it for a specific purpose and under specific directions. It is difficult to see how this proposal could be made generally applicable, because Parliament always votes money for a specific purpose. I see what is in my hon. Friend's mind and, on the understanding that there is no pledge at all, I will look into it and see if I can suggest anything useful to bring up on Report, although frankly I am not sanguine, because Parliament always votes its money for a specific purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And it ought to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And clearly it ought to. I am quite willing, on that general understanding, to look further into the matter and see if I can suggest anything which would be practicable, being just as anxious to have the powers as the hon. Members themselves are anxious that I should have them, supposing that I am the Minister. But we have to do it in accordance with the traditions and practices of Parliament. We cannot do something which goes outside that. However, I will consider the matter. On the point mentioned by the hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. C. White), I may say that we have already taken in hand the particular case to which he referred—namely, assistance in regard to the employment of tuberculous persons. We have already in the office specific proposals on which we are working with the Ministry of Pensions and others concerned, and which I think will be one of the first set of subjects to be submitted to a consultative council. I agree with him that that side of the treatment of tuberculosis is most necessary. We have clearly to provide for it. We must provide for it when we come to our next set of proposals. I have already referred specifically, and I am perfectly prepared to repeat it, to the King's Speech, where it was said that it was our intention in this Session of Parliament—if we are allowed to live so long—to submit proposals to Parliament with respect to the development of the health services under the Health Ministry. It is our intention to do so. Therefore, I would appeal to my hon. Friend not to press this
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
Clause after the general assurance I have given him. Perhaps I might suggest that if it were possible for us to finish the Committee stage in a few minutes, it would be more convenient, although, of course, I am at the discretion of the Committee in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure the Committee appreciate very much the splendid work performed by these institutions through the aid of voluntary subscriptions and the services rendered by the medical profession of the country.

As I understand it, the specific funds under this Section will remain in the same locale as before. I want to be certain that if the Sub-section is left out, that does not necessarily cramp or hinder the Government in making this new Welsh Department an absolute whole, or that its retention will not, for instance, make it impossible to merge the medical section and the medical work now in the hands of the Commissioners into a general section for the whole of Wales.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think my hon. Friend would be wise to press this Amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who has taken up a great deal of the time of this Committee, may I be allowed to express to the right hon. Gentleman and his Friends my gratitude and thanks for the great care and courtesy they have shown, and the atmosphere of good will which they have endeavoured to create in the endeavour to make the measure a workable one? I would thank them also for the valuable precedent they have established for legislation of the future, which will all be for the public good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SIMM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we have a hint on a matter of vital interest to a very large number of members of this Committee? The Bill we have been considering is only the precursor of another and larger measure which must follow in a few years more fully clothed. May I ask if any idea of public control of hospitals from public funds has ever entered the mind of the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has asked what the Government's intentions were on one of the points raised by one of the new Clauses down this morning. My right hon. Friend said—I think it was on the Second Reading of this Bill—that the whole question of hospitals was one of the very first which the Minister of Health
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
would have to investigate. I can only repeat the undertaking which my right hon. Friend has given more than once, namely, that it was his intention, as soon as the Ministry of Health was established, to go into the large number of questions involved in connection with the health and welfare of the community at large. We are, as a matter of fact, already working on many proposals, and no time is being lost.

I should like to apologise for the absence of my right hon. Friend who, I regret to say, owing to doctor's orders, has had to go away for a couple of days, in view of the fact that the Housing Bill is going to be introduced next week. I am sure the Committee admired very much
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
the way in which he attended, and I should like to express the gratitude which we both feel to the Committee for the way in which they have assisted us in getting this measure through in record time. The hon. Member for Middleton and Prestwich mentioned just now the good will which existed. I think it is quite conceivable that another important measure directly concerned with the health of the people may come to this Committee. If that should be so, I hope and believe we shall get the same good will and assistance as it has been our good fortune to have in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
