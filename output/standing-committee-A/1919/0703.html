	<p>(1) No former enemy alien shall for a period of seven years after the passing of this Act be permitted to land in the United Kingdom either from the sea or from the air, or to remain in the United Kingdom without the licence of the Secretary of State, which shall not be granted except as hereinafter provided.
	<ol>
	<li>The Secretary of State may grant a licence to land and to remain in the United Kingdom on such terms and conditions as he shall think fit to—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>any former enemy alien if the Secretary of State upon application made to him in the prescribed form is satisfied that the applicant is a member of a nation or race hostile to the States recently at war with His Majesty and is well disposed to His Majesty and his Government;</li>
	<li>any British-born wife of a former enemy alien and to her child or children being under the age of nineteen.</li></ol>
	<li>If a former enemy alien other than as mentioned in the last Sub-section desires to land in this country for a temporary purpose he shall before so doing make application to the Secretary of State in the prescribed form, and the Secretary of State may, after due inquiry, grant him a licence to land and to remain in the United Kingdom for a period not exceeding one month on such terms and conditions as they may think fit.</li>
	<li>If a former enemy alien be accidentally forced to land from an aircraft in the United Kingdom without any such licence as aforesaid he shall within twenty-four hours report himself to the nearest police authority, and shall not be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom.—[	<i>Sir Herbert Nield.</i>]</li></ol></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be now read a second time."</p></blockquote>
The effect of the Clause is to prohibit a former enemy alien from entering the United Kingdom for a period of seven years after the passing of the Act. I suppose this is the very first time one has had to provide against persons landing from the air. The Clause proposes that during this period no subject, except those like the Czechs and other nationalities of
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
South-East Europe, shall be allowed to land except under conditions of a licence to be granted by the Secretary of State. That licence should be limited to a temporary purpose only, so that he is required at the expiration of the licence either to quit the Kingdom or to make further application for a renewal of the licence on special grounds. There is a special Subsection which requires anyone landing from aircraft to report himself to the police within twenty-four hours, and, of course, subject to his not obtaining that licence, to leave the Kingdom when directed. It may be said that this is unprecedented so far as this Kingdom is concerned. My answer to that is that the conditions under which the War has been waged, and indeed the conditions under which it was planned, justify us for the present in treating the Germans as a race apart. We are not alone in that, because other countries are actually proposing legislation of a similar character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made inquiry as far back as February by question in the House to the Foreign Office, asking for particulars of proposed legislation, if any, which was being put forward in Allied countries, and I have persistently pursued that matter both in correspondence and in questions in the House until the present time. It was not until the day before yesterday that I received an official answer, having a few days before had a letter from the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs inviting me to call at the Foreign Office and to inspect the reports which had ultimately been received from these various centres, which were so voluminous that he could not possibly put them into a Parliamentary Paper. As I have not yet had an opportunity, nor do I think it is proper that I should go to the Foreign Office and make inspection and take my own extracts, I prefer to ask the Foreign Office to inform the House what are the provisions that other Allied countries are proposing to adopt. Therefore, by arrangement with the Under-Secretary I have a question down for next Tuesday which he has promised to answer by submitting an epitome of the various proposals which are made. The question I asked on 1st July, was as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can now give information as to what legislative proposals have been made or carried by the Allied Governments with respect to the exclusion of subjects of enemy countries recently at war with the Allies, and what, if any, enactments have been passed for repatriation?"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
The answer was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have received Reports on the subject referred to in the first part of the question from His Majesty's representatives at Paris, Washington, Athens, and Lisbon. I am awaiting others from Rome, Brussels, and Rio de Janeiro. If the hon. Member will call at the Foreign Office I shall be glad to show him the Reports so far received, the contents of which cannot be stated shortly."</p></blockquote>
I hope, therefore, that on Tuesday next the House will be informed by a concise answer what is the purport of this proposed legislation. In the absence of official information I am bound to fall back upon a report which appears, I think, in the "Daily Telegraph" or the "Morning Post" of 18th May last:
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>From our own correspondent at Washington.</i>"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Congress will take up during this Session the future immigration policy of the United States. There is a widespread feeling among members of Congress that Germans must be rigidly excluded both on moral and economic grounds. Morally, the German is a leper and should be so branded by the civilised world; but apart from that, economically he is of more value to the world in Germany than he would be elsewhere. Able-bodied Germans by thousands, it is. believed, would be only too anxious to emigrate to the United States to escape the labour the world will require from Germany to pay her debt to the Allied Powers, and if any considerable portion of German man-power is permitted to emigrate, the debt will be more slowly paid. Members of Congress think it would be advisable to prohibit German immigration so long as the Reparation Commission remains in existence—in short, that until reparation is made, the German must work for the nations he injured."</p></blockquote>
I have never seen any contradiction or any whittling down of that statement. If that be true, then America is determined upon a policy of exclusion for a definite term of years. We were told by the Lord Chancellor, while he was Attorney-General, in one of his speeches, which has been repeated more than once in the House of Lords in his. presence, that there were at the date of his speech, within the compass of the General Election, already 20,000 Germans waiting at Rotterdam to enter England, all of whom had taken care to get a protective Dutch nationality or Swiss nationality, so as to be able to claim to be of neutral nationality. He warned his hearers of that condition of things, and said that the Government would take steps to prevent it. If the Government are pledged, as the Debate here yesterday showed, towards a very wide system—the representatives of the Government here did not take the pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
posals that were then put before them, but they did say in effect they were going to carry out Government policy by Order in Council—and if it is desirable to get rid of some of these people who are in this country—we should like to get rid of the whole of them with a few exceptions—then, 	<i>a fortiori</i>, we ought to take steps to prevent the immigration of Germans who have not hitherto been here, or who have been here and returned to Germany to fight in the War, and who propose to come back to resume their avocations in this country. That surely is a matter almost beyond argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Government do not think that the provisions of the new Clause are altogether what they themselves would wish. I should be glad to hear about that. I think it is sufficient to call attention to the fact that a general policy of restricting alien immigration will not do in this case. We know how the country has been treated by the complete failure of the Aliens Act of 1905, how when it applied to an emigrant ship bringing more than a certain number of people it was subject to the order of the Secretary of State, and it was an order issued by Lord Gladstone, then Home Secretary, which destroyed very largely the beneficial effect of that measure as regards entry into the ports. As my hon. and learned Friend pointed out yesterday, we not only want to keep out the German, the ordinary working-class German, but we want particularly to keep out those people who come over in the saloons of steamships with first-class tickets, who have money at their command. We know that they are able and astute men, and that before the War they came over deliberately for the purposes of State, quite apart from purposes of gain, and wound a coil round British industry and British life which we hope to sever after our experiences during the War.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You cannot shut your eyes to the fact that Germany to-day is an absolutely different place from the Germany of 1870. Up to 1870 Germany contained much that was good, and no doubt contributed very largely to the sciences, to the knowledge and, indeed, to the home life of the world. A curious instance of this, which shows the tremendous change which has taken place in Germany, and it is that change which justifies this Clause, relates to music. Those of us who are familiar with Church music, and those of us who are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
members of the Temple in particular, know that if there was one person who loved music it was the famous old organist, Dr. Hopkins. If you take his book which is current there now, you will find that almost all the tunes, certainly a large proportion of them, are adapted from German writers. Our most popular hymn tunes were written by Germans. [An HON. MEMBER: "Shame!"] I do not think that. But I think it is important as showing what Germany was before the evil spirit of the Hohenzollerns gripped it as it has done during the last forty years. Germany was a God-fearing nation in those days, and could teach the people of the world a good deal in regard to home life and home rule and the way to fear God. From 1870 onwards there has been a great change. Since 1870 there has been a shocking and deplorable change, and it is a matter for very serious consideration that we should have legislation of this character. In the elementary schools, in the Universities, and in every branch of learning, and in the Lutheran Church of Germany every effort has been made, most systematically and most successfully, to turn the current of people's thoughts entirely, and some people assert that they have actually set up for themselves a new standard of living and an absolutely new-Deity to worship. The result is that you find Germany to-day is an entirely different thing from the old Germany. The united German Empire bringing into line all those that were formally independent States that has caused the mischief to permeate the whole of what is known as the German Empire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can you believe that people who have behaved as they have can be trusted? It is not the military caste only. It is impossible to shut one's eyes to the fact that the German population as a whole have applauded the shocking doings of the Army during the War, the deplorable outrages that have taken place in the matters of conducting the War, the way in which the civilian population of occupied territories have been treated, and the policy of bombing industrial centres like our own on the pretence that they were fortified places. If they were fortified places they could have been of no possible avail to Germany for the uses of the War unless they had been arsenals for the manufacture of war materials. They dropped their incendiary and explosive bombs on places
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
which they knew perfectly well had no concern at all with the manufacture of munitions or with any operations of war. They have again and again shown themselves absolutely oblivious of all the rules of civilised warfare, and their civil population have applauded their deeds. Such a thing is unthinkable of the German nation as it formally existed. That kind of spirit was shown by the scuttling of the ships on Sunday week and by the destruction of the colours which they were under treaty to give back to France, which shows that they are as demented as a whole as they were during the early days of the War when they thought they were going to make world conquests. Under these circumstances we are justified in saying that they shall not enter this country for a period of years. I do not know that we are wedded to seven years; but it must be a definite period to mark the sense of those countries who have had to submit to the barbaric methods of the Germans, and let the world see and young Germany see that the methods on which Germany has been brought up are wrong and condemned by the whole civilised world. From the commercial point of view it was positively derogatory to us, and it must have been with feelings of shame that we English had to grant letters of naturalisation in the early days of the War to the full-blooded German — Baron Schroeder, because it was said that unless we did so the whole of our money market would have been paralysed. Why should we ever have allowed such a condition of things? We have allowed the Metal Market and the Chemical Trade, even in our country, to be captured by them. I hope that by pasing this Clause, modified as the Committee may think fit, we may mark the disapprobation of the British people of the methods employed against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOHN BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In commending this Clause to the attention of the Committee I may recall the pledges of the Government as to the legislation with regard to the immigration of former enemy aliens and contrast those pledges with the way in which the Home Secretary proposes to carry them out by the draft Order in Council which he has circulated. I read yesterday the pledges given by the Lord Chancellor and the Prime Minister. I will refer now to a pledge given by the Leader of the House,. Mr. Bonar Law, on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
the 4th of December last, before the election. He said that so far as the Government were concerned they would not only send back those whom they had interned but they would also not allow others to come in. Could there be any pledge more definite than that? I have not the smallest doubt that the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, and the Leader of the House intend to carry out that pledge to the letter, and in that belief I ask the Home Secretary to approach this question. A very important statement was made in another House on the 19th of November of last year by the late Home Secretary, while he still occupied the post of Home Secretary, and while he was speaking for the Government. Referring to the Bill which was then promised, and is now before the Committee. he. said it would enable the Government of the day by Order in Council to impose special restrictions on the landing here of those who are to-day our enemies, and to insert special provisions as to ex-enemies of this country. When you come to look at the proposed Order in Council there is not one special restriction imposed on our former enemies. They are dealt with in just the same way as the French.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary agreed yesterday, as I thought he would, that the pledges of the members of the Government to whom I refer, must be carried out to the letter. We have got his draft Order in Council, and instead of imposing special restrictions on our former enemies as to immigration, he treats them in exactly the same way as our Allies who fought with us all through the War. In other words he gives Germans just as good an opportunity of entering this country as the subjects of the Allied countries who have been fighting for our liberties against barbarism. Apart from pledges altogether, I cannot imagine how any British Minister who knows anything of the feelings of the people of this country, who has been through the last election, who knows what Members of this House promised, and what the people want, should come here with the proposal embodied in this draft Order, for the purpose of treating the barbarous Germans as regards immigration, on precisely the same footing as our chivalrous splendid Allies, the French, and our other Allies who fought for the destruction of German tyranny. But that is the way the Home Secretary determines to carry out
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
his pledge. I have a little complaint against him. When he told us that he and I were as one in point of object—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have seen a great many things amongst certain members of the Government since they came into office, but speaking for myself I have absolute confidence in the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House. They have unfortunately been
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
away at the Peace Conference. During their absence some strange things have happened, and to-day I should like to know, and we shall have to ask the Prime Minister in due course, whether it is by his authority that the Home Secretary says he is going to disregard the pledge of the Attorney-General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be misrepresented. I have said nothing of the kind. I cannot help your understanding, but I refuse to be misrepresented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has implied that he would be bound by the pledges of the Attorney-General. He has said over and over again that he is going to carry out the pledges of the Prime Minister, but he refuses to say that he is going to carry out the pledge of the Attorney-General. I hope that when he gets up he will say definitely whether he is going to throw over the pledges of the present Lord Chancellor. But that is not all. What about the pledges of the Leader of the House? Is he going to carry those out? Silence. I suppose we shall get an answer to that in the course of time. This is a new principle of constitutional government, and when members of the highest authority in the Cabinet at a General Election make a specific promise, I want to know whether it is going to be carried or not, and if the Leader of the House says that we will not allow other Germans to come in, is that promise going to be made or not? I do beg the Home Secretary to give his earnest attention to this question, because it goes to the root of representative government. If the Leader of the House of Commons in the name of the Government makes a solemn pledge at election time and gain votes and seats, is the Home Secretary to be allowed afterwards to pay no regard to it? As a matter of fact, he is paying no regard to these pledges. I have in my hand the draft Order in Council, which the right hon. Gentleman was good enough to circulate, showing what he intends to do if the House allows him, and if this Bill is passed without alteration. Clause 1 of the draft Order in Council deals with restrictions on the landing of aliens. It says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"An alien coming from outside the United Kingdom shall not land in the United Kingdom except with the leave of the immigration officer."</p></blockquote>
This leave shall not be given unless he complies with certain conditions, such as that he is in a position to support himself,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
is not a lunatic and some other things. Is that carrying out the pledge of the Leader of the House that Germans are not to be allowed to come in? Is it carrying out the pledge of the late Home Secretary Lord Gave, that special restrictions should be put upon Germans as compared with friendly aliens? I hope that this Committee, and that the House when the Bill comes before it, will say that it is right to make some distinction between the restrictions placed upon the landing of Germans and other former enemy aliens in this country and the landing of the French. There is the position in which we stand to-day. The Germans and the French are treated in exactly the same way for the purposes of immigration. I shall listen with some curiosity to the Home Secretary when he tells us that this is a redemption of the Government's pledges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause we propose says, in substance, that former enemy aliens are not to be allowed to land for seven years. There are certain exemptions from that, which the Committee will probably agree are right, namely, that it should not apply to those who were merely technically enemy aliens and to those who are really friendly enemy aliens. There is also exemption in the case of the British-born wives of Germans, those who have unfortunately married Germans, who may be in Germany at this moment and who want to come back to this country. Most people will agree that we should allow them to come back if they want to come, although, being the wives of Germans, they are technically enemy aliens. If the Home Secretary will accept the principle of the Clause, I, personally, and my hon. Friends will agree to accept any reasonable alterations either as to the time or methods which the Government may think proper in order to carry it out. But the question for the moment is one of principle, Aye or No, will the Home Secretary carry out the pledges and will he embody in the Bill a Clause, to be amended if necessary on subsequent consideration, which is demanded by the vast majority of the people of the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It will be generally admitted that there is nothing in the draft Order in Council directly touching this question. It is certainly a point that ought to have been dealt with having regard to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
peaceful penetration which took place prior to the War, the manner in which Germans came into this country and by subterranean methods filched our trade from us, and also having regard to the fact that the opinion has been expressed almost universally throughout the country that this sort of thing must not be allowed to go on and that after the War we should take measures to prevent any repetition of this peaceful penetration. In view of these things I cannot for a moment believe that either the Home Secretary or any member of the Government would wish us to allow the unrestricted immigration of enemy aliens into this country. That is the principle which this Clause affirms. I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for York (Sir J. Butcher) that those who support this Clause are not necessarily wedded to all its details. The period of seven years for which these restrictions are to apply may be thought by some to be too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is ten years in America.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question does not arise on the Second Reading of the Clause. Whether it should be provided that the licence should be granted in some other cases beyond those mentioned in the Clause is also a matter which the Committee might very well consider. If the Home Secretary would say "I will accept the Clause and later on I shall propose that it should be amended in certain respects either as to the period or as to the enemy aliens who shall be entitled to receive a licence," then I think we might come to business. It is not my desire, and I am sure it is not the desire of any of my hon. Friends to oppose and try to defeat the Government. We want to come to an arrangement with them. It is admitted that it is not in the draft Order in Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not admitted. I did not admit anything of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very glad if my right hon. Friend will point out the provisions in the draft Order in Council which meet this case. I have looked through it and cannot see any such provisions. I believe the majority of the Committee will agree that we cannot allow to go on the unrestricted immigration of Germans into this country such as we had before the War, and which inflicted such great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
injury on our trade. The question is in a nutshell, and I hope the Home Secretary will get up early in the Debate and say he is prepared to meet us in some way. I am sure we all have the same object in view. We do not want to put a ban on Germans coming into this country necessarily for all time, but we do not want them in for some years. We want them to be punished for the wickedness they have perpetrated, and the harm they have done to us, not only by making war upon us and carrying it on so ruthlessly, but for the subtle and underhand manner in which they interfered with our trade before the War.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir WILLIAM PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in the suggestion just made that we should allow the Clause to be read a second time. There is a good deal of question whether the draft Order in Council does what is absolutely required. It would save time, if the Government are prepared to deal with the matter, to allow the Clause to be read a second time now and let us discuss the details afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir COURTENAY WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a good deal of acrimonious controversy here. I do not think that is the sort of thing we ought to have in a Committee. The great value of a Grand Committee is that we can discuss things and that the Government may make arrangements to meet the desires of the House in a reasonable way. I am afraid that the attitude the Home Secretary is taking up of a simple 	<i>non possumus</i> to this Clause and these Clauses is one in which he will experience great difficulty and even greater difficulty in the House than here. I do not think it is realised what the pledges of hon. Members to their constituents have been. We have heard a great deal of the pledges of the Prime Minister and of the Government. It is quite true that sometimes any Government is forced to go back on something it has said. That may be true to a certain extent of Members of Parliament, but the principles have to be adhered to. When it comes to the question of pledges of Members of Parliament, I put my own case. I was asked at almost every meeting whether I was in favour of turning all the Germans out of the country and keeping them out. My answer was—
	<br><blockquote><p>"You cannot turn everyone out. I have been trying to get rid of some things, but have not been able to do so. For instance, on my estate,
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
I have tried to get rid of rats and rabbits, but I have not been able to get rid of them all, and it is the same thing with the Germans."</p></blockquote>
But I gave the pledge which I think every Member gave, that was to do my utmost to keep the Germans out of this country as far as possible. This Bill goes a very short way towards that. Here is a Clause which lays down definitely that we do not want them for a certain number of years. I quite agree that seven years is rather a long time to remain in a semi-state of war. I have handed in an Amendment to reduce the period to three years. We are not met sympathetically and unless the Government will take a more sympathetic view and realise the position of Members of Parliament on this subject, I foresee a great deal of trouble. This Clause may be too strong. If it is, it can be amended. Let the Government amend it. Those who have spoken most strongly on this Clause and the Clause that was before us yesterday are not in any way opposed to drastic Amendments where what is proposed could not be carried out, but to say that we must leave it all to Orders in Council is an impossible condition for the Committee to accept. I warn the Home Secretary that he is really making a great mistake in not trying to arrange things here, because when we go down to the House it will be an infinitely long proceeding, the Debate will be much more acrimonious and there will be greater difficulties. I hope the Government will agree to the Clause being read a second time and that what alterations are necessary will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill will not give way to all this talk. I had no intention of speaking, but rather of sitting quiet and voting for what I thought were the interests of the country. But as a soldier I am bound to speak from the soldiers' point of view on a matter of this kind. It is really with great disgust, if I may use that expression, that I have listened to this discussion. We went out and fought for certain principles. The provisions of these new Clauses are absolutely contradictory of all that we have been fighting about through this War. Quite apart from that, I see a lot of vulgar panic which is most objectionable to all of us. Under the original Bill powers were given to the Home Secretary to enable him to commit injustice or cruelty to any extent he could possibly desire. I hope he will not use them in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
These new Clauses do not strengthen his hands in the least. Under the original Bill he could do anything he liked with regard to enemy aliens. To add this Clause would be to weaken the Bill enormously. It weakens the country and its reputation enormously. It shows a sense of panic which would have been becoming in this country if we had lost or drawn the War, but it is quite impossible for us after we have won the War. It is only right to inform the hon. Members who have proposed and supported these extra Clauses that when this matter comes into the House on Report we soldiers are going to have our say about it, and very possibly what I may call the group of patriots may find that what we have to say is extremely objectionable. I hope, before pressing for exclusion of these extra Clauses they will give consideration to that. It would be very objectionable to us to have to rise in the House in opposition—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is "us"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The soldiers in the House. It is only fair to let hon. Members know that we intend to have our say about this. After all, in a matter of this kind particularly we soldiers have a right to have something to say. Meanwhile, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not give way in the least. The Bill in its original form is as good as a Bill of this sort can be, it gives the fullest possible power to deal with any dangerous alien, and to add these Clauses would weaken it enormously and tie the right hon. Gentleman's hands in a way which to my mind would be very dangerous indeed. I have spoken, perhaps, with a little heat, but really it is very annoying indeed to have the work we have done spoilt by this sort of spirit being introduced after peace has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate what had been said by my hon. Friend (Sir C. Warner) about the attitude which should be taken up in the Committee. I think it is a great pity that there should be a 	<i>non possumus</i> attitude. I appreciate that we should all be trying as reasonably as possible to carry out what we really all desire, namely, proper protection against German aliens, or enemy aliens of any kind. And I am very anxious to adopt that attitude, and I am sure my hon. Friends opposite are. Therefore I have not the slightest doubt that they will at once withdraw this Clause and enable us to
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
deal with the Order in Council in such a way that it will carry out all they desire. That can easily be done. The Order in Council provides that the alien must fulfil such other requirements as may be prescribed by any general or special instructions of the Secretary of State. Paragraph (	<i>g</i>) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An alien may not land unless he complies with the following conditions."</p></blockquote>
One of these is that he fulfils such other requirements as may be prescribed by any general or special instructions of the Secretary of State. The object of that is to carry out all necessary provisions for differentiation between a Frenchman and a German, between an Austrian and an Italian, between an enemy and an Ally. I have read the Report of what I said yesterday, and my position was made perfectly clear, and I do not intend to repeat it. But the intention was to carry out the Prime Minister's pledge that we would take proper steps to keep out the Germans. I must oppose to the utmost of my power putting this Clause into the Bill. It would hamper us. Yesterday's Clause was bad enough. This is far worse and there is a worse down again on the Paper. It would hamper us in every possible way. Our political international relations are in a state of great delicacy at present, and if Clauses like this were published abroad as being on the Statute Book of this country, it would tie the hands of the Government in a way which might be most serious. So far as trade is concerned, I do not know what is the opinion of the Committee. Are we to trade with Germany in the future or are we not? Are we to hand over the whole of the German trade to America, France, and Japan? I have heard a newspaper report read about the steps that America is going to take to keep out the alien. We know perfectly well that at this moment America and Japan are straining every nerve to capture German trade. If any man will get up and say logically, "I am not going to have anything to do with Germany again; I do not care how it impoverishes this country, I will have no truck with German trade of any sort or description," this Clause is right enough. But if we are going to trade with Germany, if we are going in the future to take advantage of German trade, a Clause of this description will make it absolutely impossible. It is simply driving German trade into the hands of America and Japan. That would apply equally, of course, when you come to discuss what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
restrictions the Secretary of State should put on which any alien would have to observe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My strong grounds for opposition to this Clause, as was my strong ground and my only real ground for opposition to it on a whole, was that to put this into the Bill is the wrong method of carrying out our desires and would hamper the Government very seriously. It is unfair to me to say that because I do not want a Clause of this kind put into the Bill, therefore I would not put something equivalent to this provision into the Order in Council. I am accused of not adhering to the pledges of the Government because I say that if you carry them out in this particular way you will do the greatest possible harm to the Government and hamper them. That is my position. I must adhere to it. I cannot do anything to weaken it. I cannot make the slightest show of accepting anything which involves a Clause of this kind being put into the Bill. I am quite ready to discuss this or any equally stringent measure in the Order in Council, but, having regard to the discussions we have had in the Government and to what has been done, I cannot yield in any way to the putting of a Clause of this description into the Bill. Again I say it must not be taken that because I take that attitude here today I do not want these provisions or something similar to be enforced at some time, but if they are enforced under the Order in Council they can be strengthened or relaxed at any moment. They can meet any emergency that turns up. Put them into this Bill and your hands are tied. I do not care whether it is for a year or for three or seven years, the result is the same. I ask the Committee seriously to let this sort of thing be carried out in the way we suggest, which can be relaxed, which could meet any emergency or any diplomatic change, and not to tie us down in a way which would be most dangerous in a critical period of time like this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has told us that he demurs very strongly to the suggestion that because he will not accept the Clause therefore he does not want to carry out the same purposes that we have in view. After all I think we may claim that we are just as good judges of that as he is. Why is he, merely because he is in an official position, in any better position to judge as to the right way of carrying that out than
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
any other member of the Committee? I do not know whether an official position opens up mysteries which are closed to all the rest of the world. It appears to me this is merely a matter of ordinary common sense. Of course there may he legitimate differences of opinion and the right hon. Gentleman holds one and the Committee holds the other, or at any rate the Committee did hold another upon the Clause which was decided yesterday. That being so I should have thought really the commonsense method of dealing with this would be for him to say "I still hold to my view that the method of this proposed Order in Council is the best way, but if there are a number of my colleagues in the Committee and in the House who prefer to have it in the Bill, I am quite willing to allow a Second Reading and then let us discuss in detail and make Amendments which may be found necessary."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has at last pointed out to us the Clause upon which he relies in this proposed Order in Council for dealing with the matter, and I do not think it is any wonder that several of us had searched in vain to discover where it was hidden. It is headed "Admission of Aliens." Therefore my hon. Friend (Sir J. Butcher) was perfectly justified when he pointed out that in the Order in Council itself there is no differentiation whatever between friendly aliens and enemy aliens. Apart altogether from the question whether or not that Clause enables the Home Secretary to carry out the purpose it is objectionable that in the Order in Council that there should be no previous differentiation between these two. classes, because when we are now legislating after the War, with reference to the whole of this matter, and having in view the strong opinions which have been held, not only by the Government but throughout the country, and the pledges given at the election, it is well to proclaim to all the world that the British Government and the British Parliament are not going to treat enemy aliens in the same spirit and by the same measures as they are going to treat friendly aliens. Therefore the first point I make is that the mere form is defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the words in which the Home Office is going to deal with the whole question of excluding enemy aliens. The proposed immigrant is to prove that he fulfils; such other requirements as may be pre-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
scribed under any general or special instructions of the Secretary of State. What can the other requirements possibly be? According to the right hon. Gentleman the other requirements he is to set out are going to be his nationality. We have not got even now any sort of insurance that he proposes, when the administration of this matter comes up, to require that every man who comes into this country shall satisfy the Home Office that he is not a citizen of a hostile State. That is not his intention because, having pointed out that those are the words upon which he relies, he immediately went on—it was very significant—to use an argument which, if it had any force whatever, was to show that he was going to welcome Germans back into this country. Otherwise what was the force of making the observations he did about our future trade with Germany. I quite recognise that trade with Germany, whether we like it or not, will be an economic necessity, but if the right hon. Gentleman's view is that in order to enable our trade with Germany to proceed we must allow Germans to come back to this country—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the purport of his argument. Otherwise it had no force whatever. It may be a perfectly sound and arguable one on the question of economic policy, but it certainly is an admission on his part that, so far as the enemy alien question is concerned he is prepared to allow Germans to come back into this country. That really brings me to a very clear issue between us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are brought back under this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But with very rigid restrictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are brought back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be. If they are brought back sufficiently under this Clause, why does he not accept it? He will not accept it for the mysterious and automatic reason he has given. He takes this high and mighty position. I am an administrator. I tell the House of Commons this is the way to do it, and we are not going to do it in any other way. The argument of the right hon. Gentleman, if it has any force whatever, is an argument in favour of admitting Germans either wholesale, or at all events with very meagre restrictions, into this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
Therefore, we are face to face with our own pledges. We are all pledged up to the hilt in this matter, and we have in the first place to carry out our own pledges to the country and also to rely upon the pledges of the Government. It is all very well for the right hon. Gentleman to say that he is going to say nothing at all about the pledges he gave yesterday. A good many of us are in great perplexity as to where he stands in regard to the pledges of the Government. I do not think the right hon. Gentleman ought to take up the attitude which, if I may respectfully say so, appears as if he were nettled with the Committee because they did not follow his advice yesterday. I think he ought not to keep us at arm's length, but he ought to tell us whether or not, as the representative of the Government, he is going either to carry out, or if he is not going to carry out, to explain to us why he is not going to carry out, the pledges given by our leaders in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman evidently feels very much aggrieved—I can see it by his attitude—because doubt appears to be cast upon his word. There have been pledges given, not in identical terms, but covering the same ground, by more than one responsible member of the Government. My hon. and learned Friend quoted the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Privy Seal, and the late Home Secretary. When my hon. Friend was dealing with the pledges given by some of these eminent leaders the Committee will have observed that several times the right hon. Gentleman got up to emphasise the fact that he was going to abide by the Prime Minister's pledge. There was no force whatever in the emphasis he laid upon the Prime Minister's pledge, when he was being pressed upon this point, unless it meant that he was able to detect some discrepancy between the Prime Minister's pledge and the others, and that he was going to rely upon the Prime Minister's pledge to the exclusion of the others. That is the obvious inference, and the right hon. Gentleman cannot get out of it. Now that he perceives the difficulty into which he has got himself by allowing that inference to force itself upon our attention, he tries to turn the whole matter aside by saying, "My words of yesterday stand and I am going to abide by them." I think that is unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know where we stand on this most important question about keep-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
ing out the Germans. Seeing that there is such a strong feeling, which is common ground with most of us, I want to say a word about the speech of the hon. and gallant Member (Mr. Hopkinson). As a mere fogey of a civilian who has unfortunately been unable to do much for his country in the War, I speak with the utmost respect of the hon. Gentleman who has been in the fighting forces of the Crown. I think he displayed something less than the modesty, which is usual from a gallant soldier: no lack of modesty 	<i>qua</i> soldier, but a little lack of modesty 	<i>qua</i> politician, because he got up and in the most 	<i>ex cathedra</i> manner led us to believe that he was the representative of the fighting forces in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander KENWORTHY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt he excellently represents his constituency, but I have the very strongest reason to believe that so far from representing military opinion in the House he very strongly misrepresents it, and I have not the slightest doubt that when we get on to the floor of the House he will find that amongst many military representatives in the House he will be in a very small minority. Yesterday I had the privilege of speaking to a very distinguished soldier who has been in a command all through this war. Therefore, I think, without any disrespect to the hon. and gallant Gentleman, I think I may say that he is more entitled to speak for the fighting causes. This distinguished soldier came up to me and said that he was delighted at the attitude that was taken by the Committee on which I was working on the Aliens question. That led to a certain amount of talk about it, and he used language as diametrically opposite as it is possible to conceive to the language used by the hon. and gallant Gentleman to-day. That I believe to be the view that is taken throughout this country both by military opinion and by civil opinion. It is not as was suggested in some of the speeches yesterday that there is any panic. The hon. and gallant Member talked about vulgar panic. He is entitled to his opinion. So far from being vulgar panic it appears to me that the attitude we represent is really only one of national dignity. Among nations, as among individuals, a man is known by his friends, and really if the hon. and gallant Member was ignorant that he was keeping company
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
with blackguards, whether male or female, and that he was in danger of having his pocket picked and having his moral character ruined by the company he was keeping, and a friend warned him, would he turn round and say "you are guilty of vulgar panic in trying to get me into better company?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not afraid of the Germans. I am not afraid of a flea, but I do not want to take it to my bosom. It is exactly the same thing in regard to Germans. We regard them as a vile race. No one has put that point of view more strongly than the Prime Minister. There is this further reason, and it is a very practical reason, why we should not contaminate ourselves by allowing these men to come into this country wholesale. We have heard a great deal about the atrocities which have been committed by our enemies during this War. It has been recorded in official documents like the Bryce Report, and we have an immense amount of other evidence. Some of us have very painful direct evidence from our friends and relations as to the treatment accorded to our men in German prisons. If the country is going to allow Germans to come back wholesale into this country, any one of our people may at any moment in the streets of our towns or in the places of common resort find themselves face to face with individual Germans who have been guilty of atrocities, to the knowledge of those who meet them. Our soldiers may find themselves in the company of men who have been the authors of outrages upon them in prison camps. If our friendly Allies, the French, as we hope they will, come to visit us, they, who have had very bitter experiences, may find that we are giving equal hospitality to individuals whose very faces recall the bitterest possible memories to those who meet them. For these reasons I think we ought to keep the Hun out of this country. I do not think seven years is too long. The Home Secretary may say that that is quite irrelevant because he is going to keep them out, but I would point out that we have no sort of assurance from the Home Secretary that he is going to do anything of the sort. Even if we had such an assurance, we have no assurance that his successor will do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if we are going to do it at all we ought to do it in a manner that will proclaim to the world what our policy is. I absolutely disbelieve. if I may respect-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
fully say so, in the menace, for it was nothing else, which the right hon. Gentleman held out to this Committee, that by passing this Clause in the form of an Act of Parliament we should be either hampering or endangering our foreign relations. I do not believe a word of it. On the contrary I believe that legislation of this sort is either being carried out or is proposed to be carried out by most of our Allies. I believe it is going to be carried out, if it has not already been carried out, in France, that it will be carried out in America, and I am quite certain it will be carried out in our Dominions. The right hon. Gentleman did not give any explanation of the menace. He suggested it, and as it rests entirely upon his 	<i>ipse dixit</i>, I think the Committee is quite entitled to disregard that threat altogether and to take the view which I respectfully press upon it that legislation of this sort, proclaimed to the world, will put us really in line with our Allies in this War and with our own Dominions, and that if it has any effect whatever, which I doubt, upon our foreign relations, it will be in a direction entirely satisfactory to this country and not the reverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. INSKIP</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The discussion seems to me to have been fined down to a very small point, because the Home Secretary has stated his willingness to meet the hon. Members who are moving this Clause, but he prefers to put the provision into an Order in Council rather than an Act of Parliament. On principle, and experience has led me to believe that it is a right principle, I am always against Orders in Council, if they can be avoided. I have had some little experience of Orders in Council and I have known them to lead to great injustice during this War, merely because persons, and especially ignorant and unlettered persons, are not aware of the provisions contained in the Orders in Council, whereas they are aware of the provisions contained in Acts of Parliament. If the Home Secretary is prepared to put something of this sort into an Order in Council, I very much hope that he will see his way to accept the principle which I am contending for, and put it into an Act of Parliament. We do not wish to fetter the hands of the Home Secretary, but we would like to see a distinction made in the Act between aliens and enemy aliens. I hope the Home Secretary will see his way to accept such a compromise on this question, if the Clause is read a second time, as will leave
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
in the first four lines of the proposed Clause, to omit the restriction that is put upon his discretion contained in the latter part of the provision, and possibly to amend the term of seven years. I think he ought to be prepared to agree to that. The advantage of that Clause would be that we should get into the Bill the principle that a former enemy alien is different from a friendly alien, and it would have the advantage of enshrining in an Act of Parliament the principle that a former enemy alien is under a duty to bring that fact to the notice of the Home Office if he wishes to be within this country and within the letter of the law, and that the duty rests upon him to obtain a licence if he wishes to land or remain in this country. The Secretary of State would thus have the ample discretion which he desires, and it would meet those of us who desire to have some distinction of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be far more convenient that the Clause should be read a second time. If the principle is affirmed by a Second Reading we shall not fall out over details either as to the period or the cases in which the Home Secretary is to be allowed to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. INSKIP</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very much impressed by what the Home Secretary said just now. You are going to trade with Germany. We cannot contemplate the permanent wholesale exclusion of enemy aliens. It would be contrary to common sense. But I do feel, not only as a matter of pledge but as a matter of conviction, that this distinction should be drawn, and the electors determined at the last election that it should be drawn if possible. Philip was sober in 1918 and I believe that Philip is still sober, and if the Home Secretary would indicate that he is prepared to accept the proposal which I recommend, I

should vote against the Clause being read a second time. Otherwise I will vote for the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TYSON WILSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Home Secretary will accept the suggestion or something like it, it may provide a way out of the difficulty. At the same time I am sorry that the hon. and learned Member who spoke last on the other side cannot see that the Clause is one which may very easily hamper in negotiations which will take place with enemy countries. I am told that negotiations on matters of details are still proceeding with the German people, and we have got to recognise this. In the district from which I come we have an immense amount of trade with Germany. If we are going to put into an Act of Parliament something which will give the enemy country an opportunity of passing something even more drastic, so far as our workpeople are concerned, then we are going to injure our trade, and instead of leading to better relations between enemy countries and ourselves it is going to lead to worse relations than we have at present. We did send an immense amount of textile machinery from Lancashire into Germany, and a very large number of British workers went over there to erect this machinery, and we ought not to put in an Act of Parliament anything that is going to hamper those who represent us, and paralyse the confidence of those who are negotiating with enemy countries. I am not quite certain that I understand what hon Gentlemen opposite mean by pledges. Am I to understand that the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal have no knowledge of this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether they have or not. They have been doing even more important business, and we are very grateful to them. I should doubt if they have had time to pay attention to its terms, but I am certain that if their attention is called to the way in which promises are being carried out they will insist on the matter being properly done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. WILSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Home Secretary has had the opportunity of consulting either of them since yesterday, and if the Prime Minister is carrying out in this Bill the pledges which he gave then it is not the Home Secretary who is ignoring his pledges but the hon. Gentleman opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not very long ago the Government brought in a Bill to redeem their pledges with regard to the restoration of trade union privileges, and I understand that the hon. Gentleman and his colleague insisted on a second Bill which carries out those pledges in a better way, and it is very much on these lines that we point out to the Government that this Bill does not carry out their pledges fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. WILSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Pre-war Practices Bill was brought in as an agreed measure between employers and employés, but with regard to the exclusion of "Huns," as they have been called, if the right hon. Gentleman will provide for carrying out what has been suggested I am not going to vote against the Clause as amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will recollect that the powers taken under the Bill are only to exist for one year. That was agreed to on the Second Beading, in order that the whole matter might be reconsidered with the experience of a year. Therefore, what I shall be prepared to ask the Committee will be this—If this proposed Clause were withdrawn, to say that no former enemy alien shall for a period of one year after the passing of this Act be permitted to land in the United Kingdom, either from the sea or from the air, or to remain in the United Kingdom without the licence of the Secretary of State. That would enable the whole matter to be reconsidered at the end of twelve months. It would make clear to the world, which there is no objection to making clear, that the enemy alien is not to be treated in the same way as the friendly alien, and it would mean to the Government the freedom for which I pleaded when I addressed the Committee before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That proposal is nothing more than, to us an old phrase, "dishing the Whigs." What is the security proposed to be given by the insertion of those words? The whole thing is left to the discretion of the Secretary of State. and he has told us in sub-paragraph (	<i>g</i>) of paragraph 1 of the draft Order in Council that he will have power of proscribing Germans, Austrians, Turks and Bulgarians from entering this country. If this ever came to be construed judicially I do not know what interpretation would be placed upon it, but sub-paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>), and (	<i>e</i>) all refer to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
personal status of a man—that he can support himself, that he is not a lunatic, and is not the subject of a certificate and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY Of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Colonel Sir Hamar Greenwood)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That refers to all aliens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I agree, but it only refers to them in relation to their status, and (	<i>g</i>) which provides that they may be proscribed, implies requirements of a similar character, and cannot be said to allude to something which they cannot rid of or comply with, so that because he is a German or Austrian is not necessarily fatal. Obviously it may be construed in that sense. Therefore we get no security from the Order in Council, and we are asked to withdraw this Clause in order that something be substituted which would merely re-affirm the powers which the right hon. Gentleman has at present. One of the complaints among the general public is that the Home Office has not done its duty during the War in relation to aliens. There is no use in blinking that. Over and over again those of us who have had to communicate with the Home Office know perfectly well, although one must make a very large allowance in the case of such a large Department as the Home Office, that one can hardly acquit the authorities from suspicion in the administration of the powers which they have hitherto possessed. The Home Office is suspect in relation to the administration of the aliens question, and the differentiation between this and that alien. It would be very unsafe to ignore this Clause. We should have it read a second time, and amended in such a way that in the case of the enemy alien some provisions should be observed which are not observed in the case of the ordinary alien.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am desirous of meeting in every way any reasonable proposal of the Home Secretary, but I do not think that this is a reasonable proposal, because it gives the Home Office the discretion of allowing every single German who wants to do so to come into this country. I do not think that that is carrying out the pledges that have been given. I urge him to read the Clause a second time and then bring forward any proposals which he thinks will reserve adequate discretion for himself and then we shall be prepared to consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the right hon. Gentleman where the difference between us lies? It appears to me to be a question of form. As I understand the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the exception of the period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, his only objection to the Clause as it stands is the inclusion of the term "seven years" and the remainder of the Clause after the words "Secretary of State."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore it is matter of form. What is the objection to reading the Clause a second time, and then enabling the Committee by Amendments to take out the words "seven years" and the limitations, if the Committee agrees with the Government that those limitations ought to go. That is the best way of arriving at the true view of the Committee. We must assume that the Government want to get a true view of the Committee. We are all agreed that "we would rather have the Government offer than nothing. Why should the Government not wish to get at the true view of the Committee by reading the Clause a second time, and then ask the Committee to leave out the words "seven years" and the limitations at the end?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will you agree to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the Government want to strike a bargain. They say that if we consent first to withdraw the Clause altogether they will give us something. The Government ought to find out what the Committee really wants. Much the easier way of doing that is to read the Clause a second time and then, if the Committee agrees to leave out these parts of the Clause they can do so. The Committee ought to press the Government very strongly to deal with the matter in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. GREENWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that if we agree upon it there will be no further discussion. At any rate, that is the view of the Home Secretary. Let me say something in reference to what was said of the hon Member opposite (Mr. R. McNeill). These limitations have nothing to do with asserting the principle which we all want to assert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You can move to leave them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. GREENWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be rather footling. I may be wrong, but that is my view.

Are we to leave the administration of these Acts to the discretion of the Home Secretary, who is always responsible to the House, or shall we put it into a Statute, which I can assure the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to my hon. Friend that as a mere matter of procedure and getting through the business we are all agreed with what he says. We do want to assert the principle. Some of us may want something else as well, but we are all agreed on asserting the principle. The Government will join with us in asserting the principle just as well in reading this Clause a second time. It does assert the principle. I see my hon. Friend shakes his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. GREENWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it asserts the principle, because the hon. Gentleman is proposing a new Clause which would contain the first four lines of this Clause. What is the difference in practice? You want us to withdraw this Clause and then go through the form of moving the first four lines leaving out the words "seven years." As soon as the new Clause is put down those of us who prefer the Clause as it stands will immediately move to insert Amendments to that Clause. What is the difference? In the one case you read the Clause a second time, and by Amendments, if the Government have a majority here, they leave out a part of it. On the other hand, you move another new Clause and we move Amendments to put these things back. You have exactly the same amount of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Prohibition of Former Enemy Aliens Holding Land, etc.).</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>(1) No former enemy alien shall be entitled, either in his own name or through the intervention of a trustee, to acquire or to hold any land or interest in land in the United Kingdom, or to carry on, either alone or jointly with any other person or persons, any business in the United Kingdom which may from time to time be certified by the President of the Board of Trade to be a key industry, or to hold any share or shares in any company carrying on such business, or in any company owning a British ship or ships.</p>
	<p>(2) Any land or interest in land, and any such business or share in any such business as is mentioned in this Section, and any share or shares in such company as is mentioned in this Section which are at the time of the passing of this Act or may hereafter be held by or in trust for a former alien enemy shall, upon an application being made to the Court in the qre-scribed manner, be vested in the public Trustee and shall be dealt with by him in such manner as may be determined by Parliament.</p>
	<p>(3)The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any former alien enemy who may be certified by the Secretary of State to be a member of a nation or race hostile to the States recently at war with His Majesty and to be well disposed to His Majesty and his Government.—[	<i>Sir J.

	<p>Brought up, and read the first time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
The object of the Clause is to prevent Germans and other former enemy aliens first, from holding land in this country; secondly, from carrying on what may be certified by the Board of Trade to be key industries; and, thirdly, from holding shares in companies owning British ships. As to land, until comparatively recent years no alien, friendly or otherwise, was allowed to hold land in this country. It is a very serious problem, looking back upon things with the knowledge we have</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
	<p>arrangement with the Government, but let us do it in the usual way.</p>
	<p>Question put, "That the Clause be read a second time."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 11: Noes, 14.</p>
	<p>now, whether we were wise in ever allowing aliens to hold land to an unrestricted amount in this country. By the common law of the country formerly aliens could not hold land at all, but then came a period of legislation in which we forgot the possibility of being engaged in war and we legislated on the principle that aliens might become naturalised almost for the asking, that aliens might hold land without being naturalised, and that they might be treated as being very much in the same position as British-born subjects. Now we have to revise that view from our present knowledge. We know that when the War came on a good many Germans who held land in this country went away from this country in order to fight against as. We know that when the War broke out a good many Germans held most valuable coal mines which were vital.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Smokeless coal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it was the smokeless coal in South Wales. There was a gentleman named Hugo Stinnis, about whose activities I interested myself for a while—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say that I may help you to this extent: In this case there will be no question as to the principle and no question as to something which makes the principle clear to the world. The difficulty we are in at present is that it is a most complicated subject. The Board of Trade are considering it very carefully. I think I told my hon. and learned Friend privately that the matter has been before the Cabinet. We want, if possible, to limit the time again, if the Committee consent. We want to limit the time to twelve months, at the expiration
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
of which there will be reconsideration. It is a matter which goes to the root of a very great deal. There are many complicated things. We must recollect that, under the Peace Treaty, all German property in this country is taken for the purposes of indemnities, but a German may buy it back again with the money he is to get from the German Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless he is prevented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, unless he is prevented. The matter is before the Board of Trade, the Home Office and the Foreign Office. The whole thing is being considered. We are prepared to put into the Bill a definite principle, and certainly to go as far as this, that there shall be no new acquisition of any of these things, either key industries or shares in shipping or anything else, for a period of twelve months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has Germany done with regard to our subjects who have held land there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Treaty she is not entitled to anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has she done in the interval?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot charge my memory, but under the Treaty she is bound not to take any reprisals of that sort. I am prepared to pledge myself on Report to put into the Bill as a minimum, that no enemy alien shall acquire land or an interest in land or any interest in a key industry or in new shipping. How far it is possible to uproot what is at present existing is the difficulty. Take a German who is allowed to stay in the country, and has a house and an acre of ground. There are great difficulties of that sort—English wives and that sort of thing. I am prepared to pledge myself to that minimum, and more if we can get it, but this is a matter which the Government thinks might very well appear in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw attention to a thing that came under my knowledge when the War first broke out. There was a very wealthy alien in this country. He had estates and a lot of men as keepers and so on. He was a pacifist and he made it a condition that his men should retire from the Territorial Force before he employed them, and that happened in more
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
than one instance. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind in considering this point about aliens owning land in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be possible for us to put this down again on Report stage with a view to getting what we are proposing? By withdrawing it now we should be able to do it, should we not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The undertaking is only for one year, but I understand that is only that it may be revised at the end of the year. It is not going to be washed out at the end of the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The undertaking means that it will be considered just as the rest of the provisions will be. This is only a one year Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand the method the right hon. Gentleman proposes. I understand legislation will be necessary during the present Session for continuing for a certain length of time Defence of the Realm Act Regulations, Emergency Acts, and so forth. As far as I can gather, the proposal now is merely what might be done in that legislation, and all that the Government is proposing is to continue for twelve months Regulations which have been in force during the War. You could have forced all these things under the Defence of the Realm Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not cover all this. You could not very well by regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act repeal this provision of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act that aliens are entitled to hold land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reference was made just now to some collieries owned by Germans before the War and there was one case particularly in South Wales.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir ERNEST WILD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Government have shown themselves amenable to reason in this matter, and we really want to proceed as amicably as we can and the real thing we want is substantive and positive legislation, I am prepared to suggest that the Clause should be withdrawn on the under-

taking of the Home Secretary, it being clearly understood that we on our part are not accepting the limitation of one year, because I for one am very much against this merely one-year legislation and should like it for a longer period. But we have an open mind on that. It will not be said when the new Clause is proposed that we have accepted one year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. WILD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must know best what can be done with regard to legislation. If he will put down a Clause we will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the satisfaction of hon. Members that the Home Secretary has met us in a reasonable way and welcome his assurance that he will bring in what he has indicated as a minimum, with our right, of course, to amend if the House thinks fit. I shall be prepared to withdraw, but I would call his attention to this. As the law stands at present with regard to companies owning British ships you might have a company consisting of three members, including the ex-Kaiser, and let us say Hindenburg, who might own any number of British ships if they had power to pay for them. One object of my Clause is to ensure that no enemy alien can have any shares in a company owning British ships and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will take care that that provision at any rate is permanent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No former enemy alien shall be employed or shall act as master, officer, or member of the crew of a British ship unless he shall be certified by the Secretary of State to be a member of a nation or race hostile to the States recently at war with His Majesty and to be well disposed to His Majesty and his Government, in which case the Secretary of State may grant him a licence to be so employed and so to act.—[	<i>Sir Herbert Nield.</i>]</p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
The necessity for the Clause is not apparently to be challenged. I dare say the Home Secretary will show that under other Statutes there are certain powers, but we should like to see some positive enactment on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

strongly as possible. I should like to amend it to make it even stronger, and I propose to do so after it has been read a second time. This is a matter that is felt most strongly by all seafaring men, as I have very good reason for knowing. The hon. Member (Mr. Havelock Wilson) has given me his personal assurance that he supports this most strongly. I can give my reasons strategically, apart from the question of any enemy aliens at all, when we come to another Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are difficulties under this, but I think they are really Committee difficulties, so I will not say anything about them now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause read a second time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we shall have to add, after the word "ship," "registered in the United Kingdom," otherwise we are legislating for our Dominions overseas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the hon. and gallant Gentleman (Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy) was going to move an Amendment. As I am prepared to support him, I think he should be alive to the point that he is likely to be cut out if he does not move now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander KENWORTHY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask for your guidance, Mr. Chairman. I have a new Clause on the Paper, but I wish to move an Amendment to the present Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be best, after the words "British ship," to insert the words "registered in the United Kingdom."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member (Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy) has a new Clause which I should like to support. If it were moved it would provide that so far as a master and officer is concerned no alien, not merely a former enemy alien, would be eligible. If the new Clause now before the Committee is passed without Amendment it will cut out the hon. and gallant Member's proposal. I thought he was going to move his new Clause as an Amendment to the Clause which we are now discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. GREENWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is to leave out the words "former enemy."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could not be right in that form. I do not think it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
right and proper to say that no alien should be a member of a crew, but I do think it is right to say that no alien should be a master or officer. Therefore, I think the proposed new Clause standing in the name of the hon. and gallant Member should be adopted in order to provide that so far as the masters and officers are concerned they should be British subjects. So far as the crew is concerned they might include aliens but not former enemy aliens. For instance, it would not be right to provide that Scandinavians and Dutchmen should not be members of the crew of a British ship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Home Secretary considered the point, and is he in sympathy with the new Clause of the hon. and gallant Member?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not given thought to the question of all aliens. My suggestion is that we should insert the words "registered in the United Kingdom" in order to prevent our appearing to be legislating for the Dominions. Then we could leave out the rest of the words, which would make the Clause much stronger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much in doubt about the hon. and gallant Member's proposal affecting all aliens, and I think for the present it would be much better to accept the Home Secretary's Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And leave the other point to be dealt with under the restrictions Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. INSKIP</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Home Secretary will not accept the Amendment in the name of the hon. and gallant Member for Hull (Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy). There is considerable humour about the hon. and gallant Member putting down this stringent Amendment, and if he had not been Member for a seafaring constituency I do not think he would have thrown over his principles in this extraordinary manner. I think we shall be transgressing common sense if we give consideration to that Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the Home Secretary should be given time to consider a proper form of words, that we should adjourn now, because this affects the British Mercantile Marine all over the world, and to put in words now hurriedly may not be advisable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after the words "British ship," to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"registered in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
So far as the prohibition of other aliens is concerned I have not considered the question, but I ask the Committee to accept the Amendment I am now making. Then I shall propose to strike out the rest of the Clause, so that the Clause shall read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No former enemy alien shall be employed or shall act as master, officer, or member of the crew of a British ship registered in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: Leave out the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless he shall be certified by the Secretary of State to be a member of a nation or race hostile to the states recently at war with His. Majesty and to be well disposed to His Majesty and his Government, in which case the Secretary of State may grant him a licence to be so employed and so to act."—[	<i>Mr. Shortt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, added to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should he glad, Mr. Chairman, if you would take the feeling of the Committee about sitting tomorrow. If they would sit tomorrow we might adjourn now, and we could finish the Committee stage tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Possibly we could get through most of the Bill if we sat until two o'clock to-day. Friday is a very bad day, because many people have made arrangements to go to their constituencies or elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that every necessary purpose will be served if we meet next week? We have made great progress with the Bill, and it looks as if we shall get the rest of it very quickly. The right hon. Gentleman has now adopted a very conciliatory attitude. It is by no means convenient to come here every morning. We have had three mornings, and if we have a fourth our correspondence will get very much into arrear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the spirit of conciliation will spread from this side to that. The necessity of the War Loan, I am afraid, will take me to Newcastle on Monday and Tuesday, and on Wednesday I shall have charge of the Electricity Bill, but I think that there is nothing left in
