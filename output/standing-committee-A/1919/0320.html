	<p>Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir S. HOARE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had practically finished what I was saying to the Committee on the last occasion. Since the last meeting of the Committee I and probably other members of the Committee have received a communication from certain representatives of the friendly societies with reference to this Amendment. It appears that the President of the Local Government Board has entered into some kind of arrangement with the representatives of the friendly societies to put a paragraph of this kind into the Bill. I cannot change my view as the result of that action, that this paragraph is not in the least the kind of paragraph that ought to be put into a Bill. It merely expresses a pious intention. I cannot understand how responsible persons like the representatives of the friendly societies or the Minister himself, can attach any importance whatever to the paragraph. If, however, he and the representatives of the friendly societies desire that a pious intention of this kind should be inserted in the Bill, I do not mind very much one way or the other. I would suggest to my hon. Friend opposite (Captain Barnett) not that he should in any way change his view as to the unsuitability of a paragraph of this kind being inserted in the Bill at all, but that he should not trouble to press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel WEIGALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree up to a certain point with my hon. Friend who has just spoken. I should like to point out to the Committee that if this new unconstitutional practice is allowed to go on it will land one in endless difficulties. I say "unconstitutional" because I think it has been frequently laid down that in no circumstances can a future Parliament be committed to any course of action by a preceding Parliament as this proposes. If it is to be open to Ministers to make private arrangements with small Sections of the community, however gullible those sections of the community may be, it strikes at the whole root of Parliamentary procedure. I hold exactly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
the view expressed by my hon. Friend, who has just spoken, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman opposite (Captain Barnett) will not carry this to a Division, because it is far too futile even to divide about. This paragraph neither informs nor illuminates the Bill in any sort of way. It is purely an expression of a pious good intention, and we all know where the path paved with good intentions leads. Do not let it be thought by the Committee that anything I have said is intended to cast the slightest slur on these great societies. Nobody knows better than I do the tremendous work they have done and in my small, humble way I have always tried to help them. But I do not want them to run away with the idea that by inserting these words in this Bill they are getting more than the expression of a pious intention of an able Minister. Do not let it be thought that if we commit ourselves to this we are going to swallow an entirely unconstitutional practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir ALFRED WARREN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say on behalf of the friendly societies how pleased we are that this view is being taken this morning. We quite appreciate the point that has been raised, but I would like the Committee to appreciate also what I endeavoured to place before them the other morning when I sought to get an Amendment inserted, namely, the deep-rooted antipathy in the friendly society movement against any association with the Poor Law administration. There is a unanimous feeling on the part of a huge body of persons, numbering some millions throughout the country, that in the matter of the Ministry of Health, if it were possible, they should not be brought into association with that which they have stood to fight for so many years. Therefore, I hope that the Committee can meet their susceptibilities in that direction. It may be, as has been stated, that this is only a pious opinion, but I can assure the Committee it will go a very long way to make the measure stand well in the eyes of this large number of persons of whom I have spoken and it will cause the starting of the Ministry, perhaps, with a better feeling than would otherwise have been the case. I should like to say on their behalf how much they appreciate the views which have been presented to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain BARNETT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what has been said I hesitate to press this to a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
Division, but there are one or two considerations which ought to be put before the Committee before the Amendment is withdrawn. I raised this point about six o'clock on Tuesday evening on grounds which I think are absolutely justified by what has fallen since from the President of the Local Government Board. He said this was a pedantic objection. I object to that criticism. Any Minister who comes before us with a Bill in which there is a paragraph which enacts nothing and which on his own confession is merely the statement of a pious opinion is asking for such an Amendment as this. It has been pointed out to me by a friend who, besides being a Member of Parliament, is a good Parliamentary draughtsman, that with a very little extension a clause might be put into every Bill if you are going to establish a precedent. Here is the form suggested—
	<br><q><p>"And it is hereby declared that it is the intention of this Act and of all other Acts (although not expressed or enacted herein or therein), that in the event of provision being made by Act of Parliament, passed in some future age, abolishing some public Department and distributing its powers amongst other Departments, there shall be transferred from the abolished Department to such other Departments (including Departments not yet in existence), such of the powers and duties of the abolished Department as appear to His Majesty or his successors to be such as could be more conveniently exercised and performed by such surviving Departments."</p></q>
It does not need much exercise of ingenuity to reduce this Clause to absolute absurdity. It is an absurdity as it stands. How is the position altered this morning? Every member of the Committee has received this circular, which apparently emanates from 112, City Road, but was really typewritten in the House of Commons. I should like to know something about the genesis of the document. We have the greatest possible respect for the National Conference of Friendly Societies, for the General Federation of Trade Unions, and for the other important bodies whose names are mentioned, but they have never been consulted about the matter at all. Is it suggested that these people have been called together since last Tuesday to consider the Amendment? Mr. Rockliff, who signed this as honorary secretary on their behalf, not only quotes the word "pedantic," which is not in the official report of my right hon. Friend's speech, but he goes on to say that if your Committee accepts this Amendment it will be considered as gra-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>135</span>
tuitously offensive to the friendly societies. I knew nothing about the friendly societies' action in this matter when I proposed this Amendment. I did it in the cause of Parliamentary order, and why in the name of commonsense anyone who is endeavouring to make this a better Bill should be told he is doing something gratuitously offensive to the friendly societies I am at a loss to conceive. The whole principle of inserting a thing of this kind in the Bill is indefensible. My right hon. Friend's speech proves that, and if I have any support whatever, if there is one just man who declines to be intimidated by this sort of circular, I will go to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am staggered to hear that the Mover of the Amendment has the slightest intention of carrying it to a Division. This may be a bad thing in the way of Parliamentary draughtsmanship and order, but from the medical point of view it is of the greatest importance. It is a question of psychology and not of law. We wish to gain the confidence of the people. The Ministry of Health is taking the greatest risk in associating itself with the Poor Law at all, and it is greatly in the interests of the Ministry of Health that it should, even if only by a pious opinion, explain that it intends to get rid of all association with the Poor Law as early as it possibly can. The feeling of the people with regard to the Poor Law is well expressed in the lines
	<br><q><p>"It was Christmas Day in the workhouse ward,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The paupers sat and cursed the board.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>And the food on the plates that were bought from the rates."</p></q>
They absolutely detest the very name of the Poor Law, and the idea of associating the Ministry of Health with it, even though it is absolutely necessary just now, is repugnant. Although we have it said by masters of Parliamentary procedure that it does not as a matter of fact diminish the association of the Poor Law with the Ministry of Health to have this pious opinion in the Clause, yet as a psychological question it diminishes the association. It is a matter of goodwill, and it is an intangible thing, but a vitally necessary thing. These declaratory Clauses may be a great innovation and may be a great danger, but it is necessary to take these risks when you are dealing with an intangible factor like the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
goodwill of the people with whom you intend to associate. The relation of doctor and patient will be the relation of the Minister of Health to the people of this country, and the question of the psychical factor is an enormously important one. The mere fact that you have declared your intention of getting rid of this fear will tend to create an atmosphere of goodwill which will go a very long way towards easing all the problems of the Ministry. We have already refused one or two Amendments on the ground that they do not really strengthen the Bill at all. I admit that this is merely a pious opinion, but the pious opinion of the House of Commons is surely not a thing to be despised and rejected if you can gain the goodwill of the patient who is four-fifths of the way towards successful recovery, and in this case the Minister of Health will tend to gain the goodwill of his patients and, even though it adds nothing to the strength of the Bill, it is well worth doing to strengthen the psychical factor as altogether apart from the legal and the pedantic objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. BRAMSDON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. and gallant Gentleman will not press his Amendment because, after all that has taken place, this is a most desirable paragraph to retain. The friendly societies of the country are very much averse to this question being mixed up with Poor Law relief. They are unanimous upon this subject, and what they did, I understand, was to approach the Minister and see if anything could be done in the Bill to meet this difficulty. The Minister, whose courtesy we all know so well, entered very heartily into the suggestion, and in order to meet the difficulty, made the proposal that this declaration should be inserted in the Bill. A promise like that is nothing more than is made every day in connection with committees when alterations that are desired from time to time cannot be made. When the Amendment was proposed by my hon. Friend for Edmonton I supported him because I felt that we ought to consult the great friendly societies upon so important a matter as this. The Committee on that occasion took that view, and the Minister then in charge of the Bill called attention to the fact that there was this declaration later on, and upon the faith of that the Amendment was withdrawn. I hope the Committee will not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
alter the idea which was promulgated on that occasion and that they will ask my hon. Friend, the Member for St. Pancras, to allow his Amendment to be withdrawn. What I do suggest in reference to the letter—although we can all criticise it, and possibly some words in the letter were inadvisable—is that it arises from the fact that the Committee were considerably surprised on Tuesday at 6 o'clock when the hon. and gallant Gentleman's Amendment was put before them. It was not, if I remember rightly, on the printed Paper. It came up without any notice and the result was that it was a great surprise to me and to a great number of hon. Members present. I hope the hon. and gallant Member will not think that there is any feeling about the matter which is hostile to his proposal. He is perfectly right in making it, but in doing so I think that he will see that he has probably disturbed the equilibrium of those who represent the friendly societies. As a matter of fact, they thought the whole matter was settled, and hon. Members interested in friendly societies thought so, too, and when you have an amendment put before you just as you are about to adjourn for the day, it is a little excusable if you feel perturbed about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel RAW</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also sincerely hope that the hon. and gallant Member will not press this matter to a Division. I think there are two issues which centre here. One is the question of Parliamentary procedure in inserting this Clause in the Bill. On that I have nothing to say. The other one is the question of giving a definite promise or pledge that the Poor Law will dissociate as quickly as possible from the Ministry of Health. I think that is the really important matter that this Committee has to consider. The Minister in charge of the Bill has given a distinct promise which, I think, meets the wishes of the whole community throughout England, Wales and Scotland, that as soon as possible this Ministry of Health Bill shall be dissociated entirely from any connection with the Poor Law, so far as the treatment of the sick is concerned. On that ground alone I hope the Committee will allow the Clause to remain, because by remaining if distinctly gives not only promise but states that the intention of the Ministry is, as soon as practicable, to dissociate the Poor Law from the Ministry of Health Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee ought to be exceedingly grateful to my hon. and gallant Friend (Captain Barnett) for raising this exceedingly important question. It is an exceedingly important question from the point of view of procedure, and a very important question on its merits. I do not propose to go into the merits of the question except to say that the Clause as it stands would seem to commit this Committee, and would seem to commit future Parliaments, so far as it can, to what is known as the Minority Report on the Poor Law. That is to say, to the distribution of the functions of the existing Poor Law amongst the various bodies. On the point of procedure I desire to associate myself with my hon. and gallant Friend in the very serious protest he has made against a practice which I am afraid may become a great deal too fashionable, and that is, the embodying of pious or impious opinions in an Act of Parliament. I think on that ground alone he is entitled to the thanks of the Committee for raising this question. We have heard a great deal too much about the intentions of the Government and about the mind of the Minister. I do not for a moment deny that the Government has intentions, good intentions I hope, but we know where those generally lead to. I do not deny for an instant that the Minister has a mind, a very excellent mind, but it may not be the mind of this Committee, it may not be the mind of the House of Commons, and it may not be the mind of future Houses of Commons. I think that quite apart from the merits of this proposal it is a mischievous form of procedure, and on that ground I desire to associate myself with my hon. and gallant Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the president of an order of friendly societies, and I hope the hon. and gallant Member will not take it that the letter of Mr. Rockcliff was used as a threat in any way. Mr. Rockcliff is the honorary secretary of a very large association of friendly societies, numbering about seven million members. In connection with the trade unions some months ago they entered into negotiations with the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill to see if it was possible to come to some working agreement. There was a chance of the whole of the Bill being wrecked unless some undertaking was given that it would be divorced absolutely from the Poor Law. I have little doubt that unless you satisfy both the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
trades unionists and the friendly societies that this matter will be divorced from the Poor Law as soon as possible, this question will be brought up in the House of Commons as well as in this Committee, because the feeling amongst the trade unions and the friendly societies is extremely strong. I do not say that in any way as a threat, and I am sorry that the letter of Mr. Rockcliff was so construed because it was never meant to be so in the slightest degree. I did not see the letter myself until the rest of the hon. Members saw it, though I am in frequent communication with Mr. Rockcliff. If you will allow this declaration to remain in the Bill, it would carry out, so far as it could carry out, the undertaking given by the President of the Local Government Board, when, on Tuesday, in reply to a question from myself, he said it was the intention of the Government at the earliest possible moment to take any and every step to dissociate the Ministry of Health from the Poor Law. If you allow this declaration to remain in the Bill it will satisfy our people that so far as the Government can pledge themselves they have pledged themselves to carry out our wishes. That is why we wish it to stay in the Bill. As regards the question of drafting and procedure I, as a new Member, know nothing about it. It may be that it is absolutely wrong in principle that it should be there; and if the Minister in charge of the Bill can put in some other words that will please everybody, I shall be satisfied. But we do want an undertaking that this Ministry shall be divorced at the earliest possible moment from the Poor Law, and that it is the intention of this Committee, and of the Government that that should take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RICHARDS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. and gallant Member who moved the Amendment waxed very indignant about some circular letter—I do not know whether I have received that letter or not; if I have I have not noticed it—pressing Upon the Committee to accept this proposed arrangement. Whatever the hon. and gallant Member may say about the time they should have had to consult the trade unionists or the members of the friendly societies, I would point out that this consultation took place a very long time ago. Immediately it is known that an attempt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
was to be made to unify the various health services of the country under one Ministry, the trade union members and the friendly societies said that the Poor Law ought not to be associated with it in any shape or form. Many important functions are to be set up under this Bill, far more important than that. But, strange to say, the one thing that the trade unionists always insisted on in considering the Ministry of Health Bill, which has been foreshadowed for some time, has been this dissociation from the Poor Law, so I claim to speak with some authority as to the desire of the trade unionists of the country. This arrangement—I do not know whether it is good, bad or indifferent—is an attempt to meet that desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to make a suggestion which will probably have the merit of pleasing no one, and therefore is possibly one on which we might agree. We are all agreed that the declaration of policy of the Government with regard to the questions of friendly societies has had a great deal to do with the Bill having got so far as it has, and it would be idle for us, whatever views we may have on that point—my own happens to be sympathetic with the views of the friendly societies—at this stage either to deny the fact or to try to cover it up. On the other hand, it is surely the most usual way of expressing that pledge to put it in this form and in this place in the Bill. Though the word "preamble" is not one which carries with it universal respect, I would submit that the declared intentions of the Government might be put into the preamble, the kind of preamble which said that whereas it was essential to unify health administration throughout the country, and among other things to segregate it from the Poor Law, and therefore these provisions were made under this Bill, it being pointed out in the preamble that they were not complete, and that the matter would have to come on again. If it was not only in the mind of the Minister, but was on the face of the Bill in this preamble, I would respectfully suggest that it would be easier for many of us to support that, than to support a method, the very novelty of which is no special recommendation, and the presence of which in a specific enactment is embarrassing to this Committee and to future legislation. In making that suggestion I do it in complete sympathy with the general policy of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
detaching health administration from the Poor Law. We know, some of us, that Ministerial pledges in preambles are never allowed to be forgotten, either by those who agree with them or those who do not, and therefore in adopting this course we are not killing the proposal. We are keeping it alive, but we are doing so without mixing it up with other things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what the last speaker has said. It seems to get us out of the difficulty. Speaking generally, new Members wish these words in and old Members wish them out. I think that when new Members have been saturated for years with Acts of Parliament they will firmly believe that the shorter and more understandable they are the better. As one who has been reading Acts of Parliament for some years, I find Parliamentary phraseology extremely involved and very difficult. It is really very hard, on reading a Clause over for the first time, to understand it. I think that it would be very much better if the Committee accepted the proposal of the hon. Member for Middleton (Sir E. Adkins) and put this into the Preamble and pleased everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PRESIDENT of the LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Dr. Addison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the friendliness of the suggestion of my hon. and learned Friend. Both that expedient and others were carefully considered and explored before we finally came to the conclusion that we would put it as it is in the present Bill. The Committee may perhaps remember that in the first draft of the Bill words to this effect appeared in the first Schedule, as it was circulated last Session, but as some speakers have here explained the volume and earnestness of the opinion of the whole of the organisations of labour, which we consulted, without any exception whatever, and of the friendly societies, with absolute uniformity, was that they were not satisfied with the effect of these words in the Schedule. They were anxious to support the general conception of the Ministry of Health Bill, and to take part, as far as they could, both locally and otherwise, in making its administration a success, but the Government was urged with all the force of organised labour and of the societies to have some words in the Bill itself which should give emphatic expression to the intention as it is set out here. The hon. Member for Oxford makes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
a very friendly animadversion on the state of my mind. I am not in the least prepared to say that he may not be quite correct, but, of course, the intentions of the Government are expressed, I would also remind him, in the provisions of the Bill itself. The Bill is the embodiment of a set of intentions. This is only one of many. I agree, from the point of view of strictly Parliamentary form, that what my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras (Captain Barnett) has said is valid criticism. Personally, I deplore not seeing the communication to which he referred. He seems to have received something which he quite properly condemns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain BARNETT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was addressed to all the members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen it myself. The Government had all these considerations before it. Really what it comes to is this. Both the trade unions and the friendly societies dealt with this Bill and felt that it was really vital to them that there must be something in the Bill itself which, at all events as far as you could commit Parliament, would commit it to this general line of action.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Sir J. HOPE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a word with regard to the debate which has just taken place on the question of the preamble and of inserting a provision with respect to the Poor Law in the preamble or in the body of the Bill. I want to suggest to the President of the Local Government Board that there is a good deal of feeling throughout the country because there is in this Bill nothing providing for the co-ordination of the local authorities. The feeling is very strong, certainly amongst the friendly societies, that there should be as quickly as possible steps taken to co-ordinate local health authorities in the same way as this Bill coordinates the central authorities. I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that when he considers this question he should also consider the desirability of inserting on Report, in the Bill or in the preamble, an assurance that the Poor Law will be excised from the purview of the Ministry of Health, and that he should also consider whether it will not be possible, in agreement with the friendly societies, to insert a provision to the effect that the coordination of the local authorities shall be proceeded with without delay and at the first possible opportunity. I fully recognise it is a very large question, but I can-not believe that we shall have a really satisfactory health administration until we have the local authorities co-ordinated in the same manner as we are now coordinating the central authorities. I hope the President of the Local Government Board will bear that suggestion in mind when he is considering the other question as to the preamble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

local health authorities, their duties, constitution, and scope. We have deliberately kept all that out of this Bill, because we propose, as the next stage, to submit proposals to Parliament with respect to the local health services and their administration, which of course brings up the whole question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir COURTENAY WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause has in it words which unfortunately nobody seemed to attach importance to at the time we were passing them, for no one put down an amendment. The words I refer to are: "It shall be lawful for His Majesty from time to time by Order in Council to transfer to the Ministers." I am not, of course, a specialist in health matters and I do not take a specialist's interest in this Bill. I am only an ordinary member of the Grand Committee, but I thought that those who are specially anxious for the passage of the Bill into law would have noticed these words, especially after the little trouble that took place in the case of another Bill in the House of Commons recently in reference to the question of doing things by Order in Council. It is quite true that under this Bill powers are only taken to do things by Order in Council which are contemplated in the Bill, and practically sanctioned under the Bill beforehand. In the case of the other Bill, however, it was left open to the Minister to do almost 'anything he liked by Order in Council. There is a great difference between the two positions, but at the same time I think that in order to get this Bill safely through its different stages, it would be wise for the Minister to reconsider these words, and to devise some other form of carrying out the proposals, instead of using the procedure of Orders in Council. In this case I do not think there is any very great harm, although I must say as a rule we do feel it is rather an autocratic way for Ministers to proceed to get powers by Orders in Council and thus do things behind the back of the Houses of Parliament. But in this case, as I have said, most of the things are already in the Bill, and therefore the point is not of such great importance. At the same time I believe the point is almost certain to be raised on the Report stage, and it would be well to have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
some alternative system to suggest in that event. There are many ways of carrying out these things without having to introduce a fresh Bill into Parliament, and without resorting to the simpler method of an Order in Council. It might, for instance, be done by a resolution of the House or something of that sort. But I only wish to draw attention to this matter because I want the Bill to go through, and because I do not desire to see the work of the Minister and the labours of this Committee absolutely wasted. This is a dangerous rock ahead of us, and unless we take very careful cognisance of it and are prepared beforehand with an alternative it may lead to trouble. It is, therefore, not desirable to shirk this point, small though it may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the very important point raised by the hon. Baronet, of which he was good enough to give me notice, I may say that I recognise that Orders in Council nowadays are distinctly unpopular—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear!"]—and that, no doubt owing to the widespread and somewhat tyrannical operation of D. O. R. A. during the last two years, they have become even less popular than they were before. But, after all, I think the hon. Baronet pointed out to the Committee a very important difference between the Orders in Council which are referred to in this Bill and others which he perhaps had in mind. I would remind the Committee that there are five sets of proceedings in the Bill which may be effected by Orders in Council. The first is the transfer of powers and duties relating to health from other Departments to the Ministry of Health. Those have been specifically discussed in detail in the Clause which we are now proposing, I hope, to add to the Bill. Then there is the transfer from the Ministry to other Departments of functions not relating to the health of the people. Then there are purposes incidental to the transfers and making them operative. Then there is the establishment of consultative councils, which come under the next Clause. A draft of a proposed form of Order relating to these has been circulated for the information of the Committee. Finally, there are a set of Orders which appoint the days when the different transfers are to take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be remembered by the Committee that there is a second class of cases in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
which powers are to be transferred hereafter—for instance, from the Ministry of Pensions; and an Order in Council is provided which will finally appoint the day on which the transfer is to take place. In every case it is something which is specifically sanctioned by Parliament in the Bill itself. After all we must adopt some procedure for carrying into effect the provisions of the Bill. There are four possible methods of doing that. You can say, "Just leave it to the Minister," but I am sure the Committee would never agree to that, and I am sure my hon. Friend, the Member for Oxford, would not agree to it. The next method is to have a separate Bill for each particular instance. I suggest with great respect that that would be an absurdity. We agreed, for instance, the other day that the powers and duties of the President of the Board of Education with respect to the medical inspection and treatment of school children and young persons should be transferred to the Minister of Health. It would be ridiculous that, this having been enacted, the Minister should then be required to come down with another Bill and say, that this shall take place on the 15th of August, or on some other day. That is equally out of the question. The third method would be to proceed by what is known as a Provisional Order. Provisional Order procedure is well known to the older Members here. The Order is laid on the Table, and has to receive the sanction of Parliament. But I suggest that the Provisional Order procedure does not, as a matter of fact, give anything like such a 	<i>bonâ fide</i> opportunity of raising objections in the House as the procedure we have set out in the Bill. The fourth possible way of carrying into effect the decisions of Parliament as embodied in this Bill is by issuing from time to time Orders in Council which will give effect to those decisions of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the only possible methods, and I suggest that when they are looked at quite fairly—and let us try to put away as far as we can the prejudices which have been raised by D.O.R.A., and look at it purely as a businesslike way of proceeding—I suggest that, if you look at the four possible ways of doing it, the issue of Orders in Council, strictly limited to what has been already enacted in the Bill, is the only practical and businesslike way. When we come to discuss the Clause re-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
lating to Orders in Council, Members may perhaps wish to suggest additional safeguards. So far as I am concerned I do not want to be in the least obstructive, but only desire some businesslike procedure which will enable us to start the machinery Which Parliament will have decreed should be set up, and it seems to me that that is as practical and businesslike and simple a way as can be devised. I do not shut the door to a better suggestion, though personally I have not heard of one, and the matter will be discussed by the Committee when we come to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will forgive me for speaking now, as I am not likely to be speaking on other topics. This is by far the most important issue in the whole question before the Committee. My right hon. Friend has with great clearness, for which I am sure we are very grateful to him, indicated the different things to which an Order in Council could be applied under the Bill and the different methods of carrying into effect the wishes of the Minister if Parliament approves of them. May I point out that the five divisions which comprise the matters as to which an Order in Council may be issued are very different among themselves. First there is the transfer of powers from other Government Departments to the Ministry of Health, and then there is the transfer of powers from the Ministry of Health to other Government Departments. Those, of course are very important. They are not questions of date or form or procedure; they have a material value. The third are purposes which are incidental and subordinate. Then there is. the question of consultative councils, which I do not propose to deal with now, as we shall be coming to it later. Fourthly, there is the question of days. I think the Committee will agree with me that procedure by Order in Council for many years prior to the War was almost exclusively confined to giving Government Departments power to do something administrative which followed properly, and of necessity from accomplished legislation. For that purpose it was obviously, and it remains obviously, the best way. But a custom grew up before the War, and has been developed during the War, far beyond the bounds of D.O.R.A., for Government Departments to seek to do by Provisional Order things which really
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
should be the subject of legislation, in order quite humanly to avoid expenditure of Parliamentary time, to avoid criticism which might be damaging, and to give further symmetry to the bureaucratic side of our Government. [Laughter.] I am sorry if I have said anything ridiculous. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I think it is extremely grave. Incidentally we are sent to Parliament to keep the bureaucracy in its place, if we can. It is the most difficult of all our duties and it has never been included in any political platform or any direction from Committees or the caucus, but there it is. I submit that we ought jealously to maintain the method of Orders in Council for the purely administrative work to which it is adapted, but that we ought to scrutinise with the greatest care any extension of it into the realm of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I point out to the Committee with great respect that the first of these and the most important, the transfer of the powers to the Ministry of Health from other Ministries, is, of course, the kind of thing which, in one form or another, must be the subject of legislation. With regard to those powers transferred at once, that is all right, for they will be transferred by Parliament after discussion in which the Ministry have been so considerate and helpful as they are being now. But when you come to those powers which can be transferred by Orders in Council may I point out what they are. With regard to those of the Ministry of Pensions we are promised two days—not before "X" and not after "Y." That largely gets rid of that question. When you come to the question of the powers of the Secretary of State in regard to the Lunacy Acts, and mental deficiency it is perfectly right, and this Committee approves, speaking generally, that these powers, or some of them, should be transferred. But the question of what should be transferred and how, are just the matters which ought to be discussed by a Parliamentary Committee. Under the Order in Council of the ordinary type, as I think I can show in a moment, there is no conceivable opportunity for the kind of discussion which this Committee has already applied in a thoroughly friendly spirit to those things which are definitely transferred at once. Therefore I submit that as regards these, some machinery other than the ordinary Order in Council is necessary to preserve Parliamentary control and to secure that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
the scope of the transfer is such as Parliament approves after hearing it explained and discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precisely the same argument applies to the reverse method of transferring from the Ministry of Health powers to other Ministries. The Ministry of Health might say: "We will transfer powers to the Home Office." It might be the wish of the Committee, after serious consideration, that they should go to some other Department. At any rate, Parliament ought to have a voice and an effective voice in saying to which other Minister powers of importance should be transferred by Order in Council. Therefore, as regards these two, which are the principal things, I submit that an Order in Council as it stands now is not the proper method, while I cordially agree with regard to the fixing a date and with regard to doing things incidentally — provided you do not create under that apparently innocent word "incidental" too many effective substitutes for legislation—one understands that the existing method of the Order in Council might be appropriate for these things. The President of the Local Government Board, with equal candour and clearness, described the four Parliamentary methods. First, there is autocratic action by the Ministry. One is glad to find that he retains that apostolic mind which would never think of such a thing. Then there is the method by Bill. Those of us who believe in the Ministry of Health, and that it should generally look after the health affairs of the country do not want another Bill which would take weeks to get through. Then here is the method of proceeding by Provisional Order. I do not quite agree with what the right hon. Gentleman said with regard to that method. Perhaps some of us have have had more to do with that method than he himself. I do not propose that that method should be adopted, because it would take almost as long as a Bill. When we come to the Order in Council, the Committee will remember what it means. An Order in Council is laid on the Table of either House of Parliament. No Motion can be made upon it without permission of the Government, except that the 11 o'clock Rule does not apply. The only chance of making any Motion is for some two or three hon. Members to watch their opportunity after 11 o'clock at night, and move that the Order be not agreed with. The method of moving that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
be not agreed with, which in form is asking His Majesty to refuse his sanction is the gravest and the most—I was going to say portentous of Parliamentary procedure—not to be undertaken lightly, and certainly a very difficult matter to be brought into effect with regard to matters which are largely administrative. Besides that, no Government, even in the last moments of decrepitude which precede an election known to be unfortunate for it, would be so decrepit as not to be able to defeat it, and so arrange Parliamentary business as to prevent any such Motion being effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I would respectfully submit to the Committee that, in all friendliness to this legislation, there ought to be some method by which it can be enquired into in a reasonable time by a Standing Committee or a Select Committee, which would really elicit the wishes of the House and determine the degree, form and scope of the transfer of new powers. It is, perhaps, a foolhardy thing to make a constructive suggestion, but I do not like, when one is thoroughly friendly to a Bill, to criticise it without making some suggestion. Mere criticism is extremely unreasonable. What I suggest is that if we are to have the method of Order in Council at all and yet to have some effective opportunity for criticism of the kind that we are now showing in this Committee to the other parts of the Bill, something of this sort might be done; that an Order in Council shall be laid in draft before each House of Parliament, and not submitted to His Majesty until a Resolution of each House has been passed approving, with or without modification, the said draft. The effect of that would be either general assent by the House of Commons or the immediate reference of the Order in Council to a Select Committee or a Grand Committee, whose report on it might modify it substantially, but who, of course, would not be likely to throw it out. In that method there is at any rate the possibility of the kind of committee examination which we are having now applied to these things. I say quite frankly to the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee that it really is not right that such indefinite powers as those contained in paragraph (	<i>d</i>)—
	<br><q><p>"Any other powers and duties … which appear to His Majesty—"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
which means His Majesty's Government—
	<br><q><p>"to relate to matters affecting or incidental to the health of the people"</p></q>
should be given. It is in effect a ukase by an Order which cannot be gone into or analysed. It is really not right, not because we do not want to unify the Ministry of Health, but because the boundary between one Ministry and another is precisely the sort of thing the House of Commons ought to inquire into, which it always has inquired into, and which is a part of its duty which ought not to be neglected. Therefore, while it is a strong thing to vote against this Clause standing part of the Bill, I earnestly ask my right hon. Friend to meet the objections which I hope he and the Committee will think are real and substantial objections that I have tried to express, and I hope he will indicate his willingness, if the method of the Order in Council is adopted, to allow such modifications of it that part of its character which consists in giving no opportunity for important modifications shall be obviated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should be quite glad to welcome any suggestions and Amendments which are practical, and which really can be effectively discussed on Clause 8, which relates to Orders in Council. The Clause is not in the usual form. I am anxious to provide that on any 	<i>bonâ fide</i> matter on which Parliament ought to have an opportunity, it should have such an opportunity. I do not want in the least to have a form of words in Clause 8 such as would exclude from Parliamentary survey anything which it ought, legitimately to survey. Certain criticisms

occur to me of the suggestion which he made, but they would be more appropriate on Clause 8. I hope the Committee will add the Clause on the general understanding that we will explore, in a sympathetic way, what we can do to make it effective and to meet the wishes of the Committee. I will explore the question further myself, and shall be glad to have friendly discussions with members of the Committee between now and Clause 8. Otherwise we might, perhaps, be duplicating our discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that the President has quite covered the ground. My right hon. Friend (Sir R. Adkins) seems to think some of the powers are going to be transferred immediately. I do not read the Bill at all in that sense, because Clause 11 says the day on which this Act may come into operation should be settled by Order in Council, therefore, these powers which some hon. Members may think are going to be transferred immediately are not going to be transferred till the Order in Council is passed. I do not think it is merely a question of scrutinising an Order in Council. The grave part of the case is that an Order in Council should be produced at all. I am afraid these Orders in Council are going to be postponed and therefore I am very anxious indeed that Clause 11 should be amended which covers the case of coming into operation and also covers the transfer of powers, and in that Clause I want to see a proviso that the latest date for the transfer of powers and for the coming into operation shall not be later than a year after the passing of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir WATSON CHEYNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), to leave out the words
	<br><q><p>"lawful for His Majesty by Order in Council to establish consultative"</p></q>
and to insert instead thereof the words
	<br><q><p>"the duty of the Minister to set up advisory."</p></q>
My proposal is to leave out the institution of these consultative councils, or, as I prefer to call them, advisory councils, by Order in Council and to make them immediately integral parts of the Ministry by making it the duty of the Ministry to set them up. There are two things to my mind which are of the greatest importance for the success of the Ministry. The first is the question of the research Department, because that is the eyes of the Ministry, and without that it will not do what it ought to do. The second is to obtain the agreement of everyone who is involved in the work of the Ministry, and perhaps the most important body of men are the medical profession. This question of the Ministry of Health has been before the medical profession for a long time. It has been discussed all over the country in various societies and under various conditions, and for once in a way the medical profession seems to be pretty well agreed. They are all in favour of the Ministry of Health, and the point that has concerned them is how to get it on the proper lines from the medical point of view, and they have all centred themselves on this question of consultative councils, so that anything which would make them suspicious that consultative councils might be delayed for some time would go very much to undermine the confidence of the medical profession in this project. It seems to me that the way that is to be done—it shall be lawful for His Majesty by Order in Council to establish these Councils—leaves it a more or less permissive question. I presume it is the Minister who sets the Orders in Councils going, and while the present prospective Minister is one we all trust and feel sure he would do what he has undertaken to do, we do not know that in a few weeks we may not be wandering about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
country again without a coupon, trying to get back into this place, and that a fresh Minister may not take the place of the present prospective Minister. Then we cannot be sure that he will feel, with regard to consultative committees, as the present Minister feels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then one's suspicion is still further added to when you come to Clause 8, in which it is definitely stated that any Order in Council may be revoked or varied by a subsequent Order. You may have these consultative councils established and then a new Minister may come in and find them a very great nuisance, and he may publish another Order revoking the whole thing, so that as the thing stands now I do not feel that we can place absolute reliance on the consultative councils as a permanent part of the Ministry and as forming a safeguard for the medical profession and the carrying out of the medical requirements in accordance with the wishes of those of the profession. That is an extremely important point, because the medical profession are the people who have to carry out the Ministry of Health. They have to be assisted, of course, in various departments, but they are the essential body, and I think you must have their complete confidence. That can only be obtained by making these consultative councils integral parts of the Bill, which cannot be altered by any Minister, but remain there as permanent parts of the institution. That is the object of my Amendment. I may not have taken the best Parliamentary way of carrying out the idea, and I am not at all insistent on the actual words I am proposing. I am insistent upon the question that they shall not be subject to the whim or passing fancy of a Minister, but they shall be very definitely and permanently established. Later on I have an Amendment to define the powers of these councils rather than leaving it to Order in Council to do so. I have not seen this document from the Local Government Board, but I hope I have made my point clear. I want to get rid of the permissive part of the Clause because I feel sure you will not get the whole-hearted work of the profession unless they know that it is a permanent thing and that they will have, I will not say a hold, but at any rate have a permanent part in the working of the Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir PHILIP MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire heartily to support the Amendment. I was a little surprised to find that this important matter was inserted in such a way as to render it permissive and not obligatory. The right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill knows very much better than I do how unanimous the medical profession were with regard to the importance of establishing a council which would advise the Ministry on all matters referring to health. I think it is safe to say that the Clause as now worded would not satisfy the bulk of the medical profession. I speak on behalf of some hundreds of members of the medical profession, including even the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill (Dr. Addison). Some 1,500 or 2,000 medical men are members of the constituency which I have at present the honour to represent, and I have received from them repeated statements as to the importance of including in this Bill the establishment of a council to advise the Ministry, which council shall be a necessary and essential part of the Bill. It is quite certain that whatever objections may be raised to procedure by Orders in Council—and I agree with my hon. Friend that those objections are very great—the objection is stronger as regards this particular Clause which lies at the root of the Bill. Unless we can get the Ministry well advised by members of the medical profession the whole of our work may not be as satisfactory as otherwise it would be. I therefore earnestly suggest to my right hon. Friend that he should accept this Amendment in the very words in which it has been proposed. My hon. Friend in moving his Amendment did not pay sufficient attention to the words of his Amendment, which are not only that it should be the duty of the Minister to set up a council, but that it shall be an advisory council and not a consultative council. There is a very important difference, and it has been brought to my notice very urgently by many members of the medical profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>HON. MEMBERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that they may consult anyone, but they may not necessarily take their opinion. To "advise" is a stronger term than to "consult."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do you suggest that the Minister is to be compelled to accept their advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not absolutely necessary. The word "advise" implies that they have the power to give the Ministry information which they may not otherwise possess, while the word "consult" means that they may merely refer to them. The medical profession attach very great importance to the word "advisory" instead of "consultative." The members of the medical profession desire that their advice be taken, and that they shall have direct access to the Minister in giving their advice, and if necessary access to Parliament in order to enforce the advice that is given. That is not put down in the Clause itself, but it is certainly part of the strong desire of the medical profession. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Someone says "hear, hear "in a sort of manner that implies that the advice of members of the medical profession should be of very little avail in determining the actions of the Ministry of Health, but I attach very considerable value to advice given by experts in a matter of this kind, and I hope that any advice given by these experts to the Minister will be carefully considered and will not be, in their own words, "pigeonholed" on the understanding that it will be considered at some time or other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. WARREN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a layman I wondered what was the difference between the term "consultative" and "advisory," and I am very much obliged to the hon. Member for London University for the definition he has endeavoured to give us. He has urged that when the Advisory Council have given advice, the advice should be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is expected that it will be followed, but it may not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. WARREN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a lively recollection of the advisory committee set up under the National Health Insurance. In the beginning it was a huge and cumbrous body bringing men and women from all parts of the country to sit in conclave and discuss questions, and then go their way in blissful ignorance as to whether a word of their advice would ever be regarded. Speaking with great respect in the presence of those who have had to do with health insurance, and speaking from experience on the advisory committee since the beginning of the Act, all I can say is that if the Advisory Committee under the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
Ministry of Health is not to be of more importance than the Advisory Committee under the National Health Insurance, it is not going to be of much importance. This is a very vital part of the Bill, and I ask that in the explanation given by the Minister in charge of the Bill we shall be told that in the setting up of either a consultative or advisory council due regard will be given to representation. There will be other matters than that of strictly medical procedure to be discussed on this council. Whilst we shall not presume for a moment to trench upon the ground rightly occupied by the medical profession, we urge that in other matters that will have to be considered there shall be most careful consideration given to representation according to the interests that will be involved. I feel persuaded that the President of the Local Government Board will give us some assurance regarding that, because if, as the hon. Member for London University urges, the advice of doctors has got to be followed, then we shall also claim that effect shall be given to the advice of other experts in other directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be different advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. WARREN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only to strengthen the measure and to secure the utmost unanimity which should exist on the part of everyone giving advice that I urge this proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it might assist the discussion if I try to explain at this early stage some of the various alternative methods of dealing with what I agree ought to be an integral part of the proposal, namely, some form of advisory or consultative body, which would enable the Minister to keep in touch with various shades of opinion, to guide him and to give the public confidence that he was acting after having consulted the people most likely to assist him. There are three ways in which these bodies can be set up. There is the way which is proposed in the Bill now drafted. I may say that I do not think that the mover of the Amendment was quite aware of the fact that it is common form to say that it should be lawful for His Majesty, and that it would not be in accordance with tradition or legislative enactment to put it in a more compulsory manner. Also there is nothing in the words as set out in the Bill which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
indicates any weakness on the part of the Minister as regards the setting up of the Councils. If it is to be done by His Majesty this is the correct way in which it should be set out in the Bill. This leads me to the next alternative, which is the Amendment proposed by the hon. Gentleman, namely, that it shall be the duty of the Minister. That Amendment, if inserted, would not have the safeguard which I understand the hon. Member desires, namely, an opportunity of being consulted as a Member of Parliament as to the way in which the Ministry which is set up should consult these bodies. It is in order to safeguard Members and to give them an opportunity of expressing their views and of seeing the way in which the Minister proposes to set up these councils, that we adopt the method proposed in the Bill. If my hon. Friend's Amendment were carried that it should be the duty of the Minister to set up the councils the Minister could do it according to his own sweet will without consulting Parliament in any way whatever. If my hon. Friend's Amendment were carried it would defeat the object which he and all of us have in mind. We all want to work together as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third alternative would be to specify in the Bill the exact nature of these councils and where they should be set up and the number of times they should meet in the year. My hon. Friend has certain Amendments down on the Paper which indicate that possibly he has that alternative in mind. I would suggest to him that it is the desire of my right hon. Friend, as it is the desire of the mover of the Amendment, that the consultative councils should be an integral part of the Ministry, and should be able to assist them. It is quite possible that when we first set out we may find that we have not been able to set them up in the final shape or form. We want to be able to get the value of the experience as we go on. We may want to be able to alter certain matters connected with the procedure, shall we say. If my hon. Friend were to specify in the Bill, and to try to define exactly how often the councils were to meet, how many were to be upon them and everything else down to the last detail, it would not be possible to get the advantage of our experience. It is because we want to be able to have a more flexible form of dealing with these councils that we hope the Committee will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
accept the proposals as set out in the Bill. If my right hon. Friend's four proposals, as adumbrated in his subsequent Amendments, were carried out, we should have to come down to Parliament and ask for a Bill if we wanted to alter anything whatever connected with these councils. If we had to do that we would get exactly what he and we want to avoid; that is delay, delay in making them effective instruments, agencies, and methods of assisting the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put to one side what I thought he had in mind first, the possibility that my right hon. Friend might have a relapse and that there might be delay in that way. He contemplated another alternative, delay due to an election. You might have that delay, but whatever you had in the Bill you would have that delay. I can assure him that there is no intention on the part of the Minister to have delay. The best way of carrying out what we all have in mind, namely, the establishment of these councils, the consultation of Parliament as far as possible, and the possibility of amending procedure connected with these councils as we get experience without having to come down to Parliament and ask for an amending Bill, which must of necessity mean delay, is carried out if the Committee accept our proposals. My hon. Friend suggested that we should have the word "advisory" instead of "consultative." I do not know that the word "advisory" has behind it as much as he suggests. I suggest that it has not, and if it had we ought not to accept it, because, after all, it is the Minister who has got to be responsible to Parliament, and it is not one of these Consultative Councils. Parliament would not want it. This Committee would not want it and my right hon. Friend opposite does not want it himself. We must not do anything to weaken the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] We all agree on that. Therefore if the word "advisory" had behind it what I thought was suggested by my hon. Friend we ought not to accept it. I do not think that it has. I do not think that there Is very much in it as between the word "consultative" and "advisory." I understand that the two words have been discussed while the Bill was being drafted, and that the word "consultative" was accepted in preference to the word "advisory."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major FARQUHARSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only want to make one remark. I hope the hon. Members who have been speaking on this question will not think that I am antagonistic to their views. I want to say on behalf of the medical profession there is no desire whatever, either in the name of the council to be set up, or in the action of the council, to in any way attempt to invade ministerial authority or ministerial responsibility. The impression was conveyed to me by the distinction drawn in the meaning of the words "advisory" and "consultative" that in some mysteriously hidden way the use of the word "advisory" impelled or compelled, or placed some degree of compulsion on the Minister to accept the advice of the council. There is not the slightest intention on the part of the medical profession that that should be the case, and I do not believe, if this particular Amendment of my hon. Friend were adopted, and the word "advisory" substituted, it would be acceptable to the profession. I think they are quite satisfied that this procedure should be by Order in Council. There is one other point I want to make. I am sure the Committee has the impression that in some hidden way, by means of this mysterious word "advisory," the medical profession are going to get some catch, hold, or grip on the Ministry of Health. I wish hon. Members to put that out of their minds entirely. I can assure them from my own knowledge, and from documents I have before me from representative bodies of medical men, that there is no such intent and no such desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my right hon. Friend was preparing the Bill he had no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
preference for either "consultative" or "advisory." He has merely put in the word "consultative" because it met with more approval than the other. I suggest there is really no difference in meaning between the two words, and that "consultative" has only been inserted because there was a greater measure of support for it outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to know a little more amout these councils generally. I am not so concerned about the details. I should like to be told what the word "council" means. Does it mean a body of 400 men, each of whom is to be paid £400 a year? Of course it does not. But no idea is given to us in the Bill as to what it really does mean. We want to know what the council is to consist of, whether it is to be constituted of a great number of people, all of whom are to be experts or whether only a portion of the members are to be experts. Are they all or are any of them to be paid members? This makes a great deal of difference. It is quite right there should be somebody in an advisory capacity to advise the Department on special subjects, but I am not quite sure that we ought to go in for an advisory council. I have here in my hand a recommendation from the Association of Municipal Corporations that this Clause should be left out, and one member of the Committee I believe has suggested that he wants to move its omission. But before we come to that point I think we ought to be in possession of further information as to what is meant by "council" and what is to be the constitution of the body. So far as I can see it does not matter whether it be termed "consultative" or "advisory."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major LANE-FOX</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise the same point as the hon. Baronet who last spoke, and I hope that the Minister in charge will give us some explanation before we go any further with this proposal. Let him tell us what the functions of this council are to be. I see there is one Amendment which suggests it will come into conflict with the local authority and that is obviously a matter which will require discussion. We are told the council is to advise the Minister on special points that may arise. I do not see myself why it is necessary to put this into the Bill at all. If this council is to be a merely harmless advisory committee the Minister could surely set it up whenever he chooses. But there must be something else behind it,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
some question of payment, or some other question which makes it necessary to put the provision into the Bill. It may be the council will have some special function. I hope the Minister in charge will enlighten us on these points. As regards the rather hair-splitting remarks of my hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary, regarding the first words in the Clause, in which he suggests it is the only possible form, I would remind him that different forms are used at the beginning of different Clauses. In one place we are told "it shall be the duty of the Minister"; in another place that "it shall be lawful," and so on. Obviously these words are purely permissive, and if it is intended that the power shall be mandatory then those particular words ought not to be used. If the intention is that it shall be permissive I do not see the necessity for inserting them in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to give a general explanation now. I thought that perhaps it would have been more convenient on one of the later Amendments, and I was really reserving the explanation for that, but if it is the wish of the Committee I will take advantage of this opportunity to make it. In the first place the reason for using the particular form to which attention has been called is that if the Minister himself were to set up a council of his own motion and freewill his action would not be subject to any form of Parliamentary criticism or review, and as this was felt to be a very important part of the general conception of the Ministry of Health, we came to the conclusion that Members would wish that Parliament itself should, if it so desired, have some opportunity of reviewing this relatively but not altogether novel procedure. We therefore had to adopt the expedient of the Order in Council. Now an Order in Council is issued by His Majesty and not by the Minister, and therefore we had to adopt the form of words appropriate to an Order in Council, and it reads accordingly that, "It shall be lawful for His Majesty." That is the reason for the differentiation in phrasing to which the hon. Member has referred. The form used is quite a customary form. As to the duties and functions of these councils, some time ago we circulated to the members of the Committee—and perhaps they have overlooked it in the great mass of papers which they have received—a document setting out the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
proposed Order in Council relating to these Committees. It has at any rate been circulated to the members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel WEIGALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I want to be perfectly sure about is whether this form of words, "It shall be lawful for His Majesty," is the only possible form by which a mandatory Order in Council can be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the form if you are to do it by Order in Council. If you do not do it by Order in Council you can say that "the Minister shall," and in that event he will be able to do it of his own free will. I repeat this is the normal form of words relating to Orders in Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it necessitate the establishent of these Committees in the same way as if we said, "It shall be the duty of the Minister?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Parliament enacts this, it is quite unbelievable that the Minister would fail to set up the consultative council. I think we must take it that if it is done by Order in Council we must have faith that the Minister will feel it his duty to carry out the intentions of Parliament. He certainly will, and I am sure he would be promptly called over the coals if he did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we come to the general purposes of these councils. There are certain other statutory advisory councils. There are some at the Board of Trade and one at the Board of Education. There is also the one to which the hon. Gentleman referred connected with National Health Insurance, and I sympathise with a good deal of what he said with respect to that Advisory Committee. I think the usefulness of these committees depends to a great extent upon their size, and I think they ought to be as small as possible. As to why we want any of these bodies at all, I say quite frankly that the view I am now expressing is a view which is largely the result of our war experience, and it is also a view which I daresay is not in accordance with the traditional accepted notions of most Government Departments. I am a thorough believer in these bodies. I believe that many Departments have suffered in times past because there has been no machinery in existence whereby they could have readily available expert counsel and advice in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
stages when they were producing something and gradually getting it together and before they became committed to a form of operations which they might subsequently desire to change. For instance, I have just been framing a Housing Bill, which I hope will be printed tomorrow. I daresay Parliament may not like it much in some respects when it sees it, though I hope it will. I could not have framed that Bill unless I had been able to call in to help me some of the most experienced men who have been engaged in the administration of our affairs in connection with our local authorities. I do not like to mention names, but various representatives of local authorities—most experienced men in local government—have been good enough to give me their advice in the framing of various parts of these proposals, some in connection with town planning, some in connection with Part I. schemes, and so on. Therefore I think the advice of experienced people in this way is very necessary for a Minister to have. It is not necessary for me to reply to the suggestions of the hon. Member opposite. It is of course impossible that the Minister should necessarily act on their advice, because you might have councils giving conflicting advice, and I am sure neither this Committee nor the House would agree to anything which would detract from his responsibility solely and only to Parliament. In the draft Order in Council which we suggest we have set out as well as we can the various points, and every question which has been asked we have really there anticipated. We suggest there, for instance, that the number of members of the council should not exceed 20. Our general conception is—but I reserve my remarks on it for the Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Carmarthen, which comes later on—our general conception is that there will probably be at least 4. I do not say they will be distinct, separate bodies, but there will certainly be one connected with the main problems of local government, one to deal with medical questions, and clearly one relating to insurance questions, and the big financial questions connected therewith. And I think it very necessary, whatever may be its form, to have one representing the general public, composed of people of good sense and experience, who are always very valuable as a corrective to any Minister. Assuming that were so, I think we must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
leave it elastic, so that it could be framed in the best way possible. At all events it is clear that in framing our future health schemes we shall have to consult freely with representative's of the great local authorities, with medical men, and with those who are experienced in insurance questions. That will obviously be necessary, whether such councils are set up in this way or not. The question, therefore, is: is it desirable to bring into the body of the Ministry this form of organisation, so that it is a part of its being? Frankly I think it is. I think it secures that the Minister will have gradually available a body of experienced advisers who are accustomed to see things from the administrative point of view, the point of view of the Minister, and so forth. My view is that as matters develop, if properly handled—of course nothing will develop properly if it is not dealt with fairly—such advice will be very useful. I may say that throughout the War in a great many Departments we simply could not have done the work unless we had adopted expedients of this kind. One very important part of the draft proposed Order is in Section 11 of it, which states that these councils may advise the Minister upon matters referred to them by him; and they may also suggest that matters should be referred to them by him. Perhaps members of the Committee, if they have not already done so, may like to take the opportunity of studying the draft Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. GRIFFITHS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask whether these councils are to be kept separate from the local authorities? Some of these local authorities have been very antiquated in their methods and have kept a great deal to themselves. Pension committees, and so forth, have been selected from the very body who carry out the work of the local authority. I want this to be a live measure, and not to be sent back to these antiquated bodies, who, after thirty or forty years, have made no progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is intended, as sincerely as the hon. Member desires it, that these shall be live bodies. Of course it will be for the Minister, after having received what advice he can get, to set up the best Councils that he can, and to try and get the most practical and useful people. When I consulted the municipal corporations and other local authorities, although they were rather shy of this kind of proposal, they did ultimately concur,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
on the understanding that these were to be advisory councils. It is quite clear that they cannot possibly come between the local authority and the Minister of Health or his Department, and there is no intention or thought that they should. As a matter of fact, they will be the means of focussing in many important departmental and administrative matters the experience of the local authorities for the guidance and assistance of the Minister, and that is what it is intended generally that they should do</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not made quite clear yet exactly what these councils are. We have the idea now that they are to have not more than twenty members and so on, but what we want to know is, are they going to be highly-paid officials and part and parcel of the office? I think that in that way the Minister would lose exactly what he has benefited by during the War, namely, the outside man whose advice he has been able to have. If you put in a council that is part and parcel of the office, they are exactly the persons who fit into the office ways and cease to be outsiders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. But the hon.

HOPE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The President of the Local Government Board gave us a very full explanation of these councils, but I regret that he postponed the question of payment. It seems to me that we cannot really understand the exact objects and duties of these councils until we know something with regard to the payment, and before the Clause is debated further I hope he will inform us whether it is intended to pay these consultative councils salaries or merely expenses, and perhaps payment for lost time? I think we might have a definite answer whether they are to be salaried officials or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major McMICKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be possible for the Minister to say at this stage what the terms of reference to these councils will be? I notice in Section 11 of the Appendix it refers to the Minister "from time to time." Also, are we to take it that the councils will deal with local government, medical, insurance, and general public questions, so that we can fill in the blank space in Section 1? In the event of differences of opinion occurring on this council, the experts who may be nominated by the Minister taking one side and the other people taking the other, what will happen? Will it be decided by vote, and will the majority have their way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only too happy to respond to the invitation of the hon. and gallant Member for Midlothian. What is in our minds is this: The committees would not be salaried, but paid the usual travelling and out-of-pocket expenses which the Government allows to all committees, and I think it should also include payment for loss of remunerative time. Take the case of a nurse, a midwife, or a trade union official. If we wanted their advice it should not be prevented because of a matter of payment. At the same time we do not want to pay any salaries. Now for the terms of reference. The blank in Section 1 means, of course, the style or general purposes of the committee. It may mean medical, local government, and so on, but I would not like to say at this moment that I could give a complete list,

because they are bound to arise from time to time. We might have one at any moment; as a matter of fact, I am just setting up one unofficially on the question of houses. This is a question which overlaps, and part of it is very technical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major McMICKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean the general terms of reference in relation to these particular committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would be embodied in the various matters referred to from time to time. We should want to refer early on to a committee which I hope will include a considerable number of women, and which will deal with a proper service of midwives, etc. Specific references would, of course, come along from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the question of the other hon. Member, I should hope committees would find a way of adjusting their difficulties other than the mode suggested; at any rate, whatever might be their recommendations—and they will differ sometimes—the Minister could never be bound by whatever they voted: he eventually must accept the responsibility for following the advice or rejecting it or getting it qualified as the case may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman will take
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
care that proper arrangements are made in the way of having the districts fairly represented. I am quite aware that housing and other conditions are quite different from those existing here, but as regards them we would rather have committees set up in our own districts, or, if not, we want to be sure that each district will be fairly represented, otherwise I am afraid that there will be trouble. If you take a district like Manchester, with its huge population, that is a district which surely ought to have a separate committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BARNES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the history of this Bill as it has unfolded itself is a very interesting one. First of all we have the struggles between the departments;for instance, on Clause 3, with which we took some liberty this morning. Then we have the covenant with the friendly societies, who are able to bring some 7,000,000 men to back them up; and it seems now that there is to be under this Clause some pressure to be brought by the medical prefession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not so at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BARNES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether it be so or not, it seems to me that we have a proposal to set up a new kind of party, which is going to have very considerable influence and power, and I think we ought to hesitate before adopting the principle of it. In the past responsibility for affairs rested very largely on the representative bodies who have been elected, and if this Clause is passed we shall bring into existence a body to which very considerable power and authority is going to be given—a body to be appointed by His Majesty, but really, I suppose, by the Minister of Health for the time being. This Clause reveals a desire on the part of the Minister for advice and assistance, which is a disposition in a Minister which we should welcome. Something was said about psychology this morning, and I think we can have no better psychological contrast than that between the Bill brought in by the Minister of Health and the Bill brought in by the Minister for Ways and Communications. Here we have a Minister who is not grasping at all the power he can get hold of and who is willing to receive advice and counsel; in the other case we have a Minister who seemed to find the whole earth almost too small for what he wished, and who is going to act entirely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
as he wishes. As between those two gentlemen I certainly feel much more in sympathy with the spirit of this Bill. But I am not sure 'that we should not be really acting in the interests of the Minister himself if we refused to pass this Clause. After all, what does the Clause do? It does not do anything to assist the object desired. The object of this Clause is to give the Minister advice and assistance, but I submit that it does not do anything in the way of increasing the advice and assistance he will get to put it into the hands of those who will advise him, an authority which I think they should not have. That disposition has been very clearly evidenced, I think, by the speeches from the other side of the room this morning. What are the powers of the Minister at the present time? He has behind him the whole of the Civil staff to give him advice and assistance. I was rather surprised this morning to hear the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board putting forward as the main reason for the adoption of this Clause the fact that it would give him a body of men of experience in administration to help him. Speaking as one who was a Civil servant for some six years, during the whole of that time I had not the slightest doubt as to my capacity to render my chief all the assistance he wanted, and I should think the gentlemen who are on his staff, or who are likely to be on it, will have the same feeling. What will happen here? You are asked to set up a statutory body, with the result that there will be divisions of opinion arising between the Minister's staff on the one hand and that statutory body on the other. I do not know whether any hon. Members have before them the pamphlet which has been published by the British Medical Association. In that pamphlet they clearly foreshadow the possibility of serious difficulty between the council to be set up and the Minister, and in such cases they assume the right to go behind the Minister and come to Parliament itself, and I think in that respect any difficulties are bound to extend from the council to the staff. It seems to me, therefore, for the protection of the Minister himself we should not give these statutory powers to a body of the kind proposed. In addition to his own staff he has behind him the whole body of health administration in the country as carried out by the expert advisors of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
various local authorities, and if he wants advice and assistance it seems to me that there are no more natural bodies than those to whom to go. That is the opinion of the medical officers themselves, because they are asking that if these consultative councils are set up there should be put between them and the Minister a health council composed of representatives from these local authorities. In addition to those two things you have got that first and second line. In addition to that, the Minister has at his disposal all the outside bodies who can come to him and give him such advice and assistance as he requires. He told us himself that his own experience is that he has had this advice from the outside, and that he has been able to prepare the Housing Bill owing to the advice given to him by the local authorities. I do not for the life of me see what is going to be gained in the ostensible object of this Bill by conferring these statutory powers on these authorities. It seems to me they narrow the channels of assistance that will come to him. At the present time it is open to anybody interested in health to approach him from their councils, if they are properly organised professional bodies, and to give him all the advice and assistance he wants. If you set up these councils what Will happen? Instead of this broad way of access you will have these four narrow wicket-gates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only from the point of view of the protection of the Minister and his assistants in this matter, but from the point of view of Parliament itself we should hesitate in setting up such a body as this, because you will not always have a Minister of Health who is willing to receive advice and to listen as the right hon. Gentleman is. You will have a Minister perhaps of a different psychological temperament, a Minister who instead of coming to the House for advice will come to the House to impress his wishes upon it. He will have at his back these councils, because, after all, these councils are going to be his creatures. He is the source of their power and influence. I have not heard anything about their payment, but it may be of their affluence too, and it may be that he can come to the House and impose on the House such things as we have here. It appears to me that we shall not be doing the Minister any disservice at all if we do not agree to the establishment of these councils. Once
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
these councils are established they will endeavour to aggrandise themselves. The assurance has been given that they are only going to be set up in London, but there is no guarantee that they will not be set up all over the country. The British Medical Association are asking that they should be set up in every local area, and I know the opinion of the people in my own local area. I think we should hesitate before we interpose between the representative bodies of this country, either in the country or in Parliament, and their advisers these more or less self-appointed bodies such as is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand my hon. and gallant Friend in the remarks he has just made, his point is that this Clause is not necessary, because if the Minister feels that he wants such advisory and consultative bodies he can already set them up without there being any such Clause in the Bill. He is quite right. The Minister can now set up advisory councils. But this Clause here was inserted in the Bill—and the proposed Order dealing with the procedure has been circulated, in order that the Minister should be able to show exactly what he had in mind as to the future organisation connected with the Ministry of Health. It was because the Minister wanted to inform Members of Parliament, and people in the country and members of this Committee, of exactly what he had in mind, that he thought it was only fair and advisable to bring this particular Clause into the Bill. My hon. Friend is quite right that the President could now set up an advisory committee. It is only that he wanted to give as much information as possible that he has brought it into the Bill. My hon. Friend is wrong when he suggests that these councils will have statutory powers. They will not have statutory powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BARNES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Statutory authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The fact that a certain number of councils are set up will not prevent the President or his successor from setting up, if he wishes to do so at any time, special 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees or 	<i>ad hoc</i> sub-committees. All that is provided for. He is merely trying to give people an indication of the way in which he hopes the organisation and the administration of the Department will run. It was rather suggested that this Clause was brought in as the result of an understanding or bargain with certain outside bodies,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
and it was because of that my right hon. Friend was in favour of them. I should like to tell the Committee that I have already worked with two councils, the one an expert and the other a non-expert council. At the Ministry of Food we had an expert agricultural advisory council, at which experts gave us their views, and at the same time we had a council representing the ordinary man and woman in the street, which was a consumers' council and proved to be extraordinarily valuable. If I could spare the time I nearly always took an hour off to listen to what was said at the meetings of those two bodies, when I saw by their agenda that matters of importance were going to be discussed. It gave me most valuable information as to the manner in which proposals would strike the outside public. Many of the suggestions made were of the utmost value to the Department as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was another point which was made by the hon. and gallant Member. He said that these councils might go past the Minister. That point was made this morning also. It has, I know, been suggested, and in fact I think there is an Amendment on the Paper, that recommendations from the councils should be published and presented to Parliament. That was carefully discussed when the Bill was under consideration, and when my right hon. Friend was trying to form in his own mind the procedure which should guide him and these bodies. If these councils have the right of presenting their report—and I take it when it is advocated they should have that right, it is contemplated that their recommendations have been accepted—if they have the right of publishing their recommendations which have not been accepted by the Minister, it follows that that Minister will be far more chary about submitting subjects to them for their consultation and advice. It will limit their utility. There is another thing, and that is that it would be very unwise, for the sake of the Minister and for the sake of the councils, to have differences of opinion such as would be indicated being carried to the House of Commons. It would weaken his authority. It is because of that that my right hon. Friend does not propose that reports and recommendations should go past the Minister and be published officially. I suggest that really what is before the Committee is an indication of what my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
right hon. Friend has in mind, and it is intended on his part to continue what has been found to be a useful experiment during the War. We are trying to get rid of many of the War restrictions. We have found that during the War we have made various experiments, and they have added to the utility of the Departments. A Minister to deal adequately and properly with the work of his Department should not, I suggest, look upon this as a new experiment, but accept it as having been tried. I think if anyone inquired of one of the Food Controllers he would find that the Consumers' Council had been of the greatest help to the Ministry of Food. It is because of that that I hope this will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. STEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is going to accept this committee, may I say a word in support? Regarding decentralisation, if he is having decentralisation for Wales, where there are 2,500,000 people, he might consider the position in the North of England, more especially in Lancashire, and between the Humber and the Mersey, where there are 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 people. Speaking as one who has travelled a great deal from the North to London, I can say how inconvenient it is for men to be taken from their homes—especially considering the train services we have now. If he could have an advisory committee, to sit, say, in York, although there may be a little local jealousy, I think he would meet the convenience of a great many people in the North of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. THOMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been suggested that these advisory councils should be received, in spite of opposition by the local authorities. We cannot generalise, but, from my own experience, my feeling is the opposite. They would welcome the expert advice that would be given to the Minister. We rather welcome this new effort on their part to get outside official evidence by experts in various directions to vivify the new Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHAW</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Referring to the speech of the hon. Member on the opposite side of the room, I am not at all particular as to whether influences have been used or not. The question I ask myself is, "Is the suggestion in accordance with common sense?" and, if it be, I have not the slightest objection to any influence that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
may have been used in order to get the Clause into the Bill. Is it an advantage that the Minister should have these consultative councils apart from his Civil Service staff? I believe it is. I believe the present Civil Service staff of this country is a highly efficient body of men. I also believe that it is conscious of its ability and will not only run the Departments in which it works, but will run the Minister as well with perfect equanimity. There is a greater danger if we accept the fear that the highly efficient Civil Service staff is sufficient, than there is by bringing in the free air of public opinion in the shape of a consultative council. I have a greater fear of the bureaucrat than I have of the man or woman who is called as an expert to give advice to the Minister and not in any way to give instructions. The Minister made it perfectly plain to us this morning that he will, as a last resort, be the deciding factor. Is not that what we all desire? We desire to see that the Minister shall be responsible for the conduct of his Department, and that we shall have somebody to answer to us in the House of Commons if the Department is badly administered. Some of us have had experience, at any rate, of advisory or consultative committees during the War, and I venture to say that some of the best work that has been done in connection with the War has been done on the advice of exactly such committees as the Minister proposes to set up. I ask the Committee to blow away all prejudices as to whether friendly societies or the medical profession or any other interests whatever have been unduly pressing and to ask themselves simply and solely, "Is this a commonsense method?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only want to say that this point has been considered by the County Councils' Association, and, without being enthusiastic or feeling strongly on the matter, they feel that these consultative councils may be of very great value. Everything will depend on their constitution. Of course, the local authorities are anxious to be adequately represented on them, and I am sure that others will welcome, as I do, what my right hon. Friend said about having upon them an adequate number of persons of what I may call the general public. We value the advice of experts, but advice of every different kind of experience does not in its totality always equal the common sense of the community, and we are anxious that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
councils should be so arranged that the ordinary people familiar with public business should have an important share on them. I would like to support the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LYLE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to ask if the Minister in charge of the Bill can give us information as to how these consultative councils will be appointed. It seems to me to make all the difference in the world. I personally, and I think the Committee, entirely agree with the principle of consultative councils, but it depends on how the councils are formed. I do not think the Minister has told us whether these consultative councils are to be, as an hon. Member at the back said, "mere creatures" of the Minister, or elected. It entirely depends on the term "advisory" or "consultative." If "advisory" means what a certain learned Gentleman interpreted it as this morning, "that an advisory council is a council whose advice having been given must be taken," I can quite understand that a Minister should want to make these councils mere "creatures," but on the other hand, the ordinary interpretation of the word is the right one. I still think it would be a great advantage and strength in the hands of the Minister himself if he could tell us that these councils were going to have an element of representation other than his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope we shall be able to reach a decision on the matter soon now. I am sure the Committee will agree it would never do to set up these committees on the basis of the representation of any interests. That would never do, and I should set my face like a flint against any suggestion of that kind. I do not think we ought to contemplate that they should be constituted on the basis of the representation of districts. What we want to do is to get the best people, who can give the best practical advice, and it is quite immaterial to me whether the right person lives in Manchester or Salford or Birmingham or Bristol or London. What we want is the right men and women, regardless of where they come from. I have had a good amount of experience during the last year or two in getting councils together for special purposes such as those at the Ministry of Munitions, to deal with various engineering problems, and other bodies of that kind, and the general method we have followed answers the intentions expressed by the hon. Member who last spoke, and I have no doubt we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
shall follow that course now. In the first place, we shall ask for the assistance of a number of bodies interested in the matter. Take a committee to deal with a question affecting local authorities. In that case, I should ask the County Councils' Association, the Association of Municipal Corporations, and the Associations of Urban and Rural District Councils to make two or three suggestions. In regard to housing questions, bodies connected with housing and the town planning councils would be asked to make suggestions. We would only invite suggestions, that is all. What you want is to have the different branches of knowledge represented, not to have all these people of the same brand and the same type of ideas, but to get useful and practical suggestions from responsible bodies such as those I have mentioned. They would only suggest people whom they thought would be useful. Out of the various suggestions which were collected it would be the responsibility of the Minister to make the best selection, and I think the Committee will approve of the suggestion that there should be no departure from that responsibility. This is a problem of getting the right body of people, and it would depend upon the purpose for which they are needed as to the class of people you would ask to assist you with their suggestions. That, I think, is the practical way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may say, in answer to the hon. Member behind me, there are statutory committees under the Board of Education, the Board of Trade, Merchant Shippng Act, and Labour Exchanges Act and Insurance Act, so that it is not altogether a novel proposal. I am not in the least apprehensive that we shall call into existence anybody that will be embarrassing to the Minister or create a difficulty with the local authorities. We should get, I hope, practical people who want to do useful work. My experience is that they are reasonable and work well with you if you handle them reasonably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is scarcely any Clause in the Bill which I welcome more than this, Clause 4, and I hope we shall be unanimous in accepting it. I do not know whether every member of the Committee has received the memorandum which I had not received this morning before I spoke. It sets out the functions of these councils, and personally I read with great interest Section (3) of Clause

11 of this memorandum which answered many of the objections which I raised when I spoke. It says:
	<br><q><p>"The council may also present to the Minister from time to time, a report on any matter affecting or incidental to the health of the people if pertaining to the functions of the council, which has not been made the subject of reference to the council under the foregoing provisions of this Order and the Minister shall receive and consider such report."</p></q>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BARNES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a rather difficult position with regard to my Amendment to leave out the words "Consultative Councils" ["to establish Consultative Councils"] and to insert instead thereof the words.

This Amendment raises the question of propaganda. It was raised on Clause 2, and if it had been left in a satisfactory position it would have been unnecessary to move the Amendment now. But, as I understand it, no propaganda is authorised except with regard to the treatment of physical and mental defects. I do not know whether that is what was intended under Clause 2.

I want to make a distinction between advice and assistance. I think the President of the Local Government Board will agree that I have given him some advice but not much assistance. It may be felt that the addition of the word "assistance" might imply that these councils had some executive function.

The power I am seeking in this Amendment we have not got yet, so far as I can see. I might mention that in the Command Paper 45, issued the other day by the Local Government Board, the Board in the final paragraph talk about these consultative councils, and say that while division of functions is necessary, care will be taken to provide for joint working arrangements in matters of common interest. As far as I know, there are no words in the Bill giving such statutory effect to the wishes of the Local Government Board. You have already seen the proposal to pay members of the consultative council, but unless you put in the words suggested here the Minister will not be able to pay members of the joint committee of the consultative councils. I do not need to point out the great importance of joint committee work. It will be among the most important under the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised, and I think it is clear, that the Minister could set up a number of individual councils or a council composed of various members from the others, which would be a consultative council, although in effect a joint council. There is nothing to fetter his discretion to set up a joint body, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
I hope the hon. Member, who I am sure desires to help me in every way he can, will not persist in this particular case. I am advised it is not in the least necessary and, quite frankly, I should not like to be tied any more than one can avoid as to the precise machinery or method for the conduct of these councils. We have got to learn, and for that reason I hope the Amendment will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons for putting down the Amendment is that the Parliamentary Secretary has an Amendment on the Paper giving power to pay money to the members of the committees of these councils. Surely under the Bill you cannot take power to pay the committees without putting in a governing Clause that such committees are going to be set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is really an Amendment to Clause 6, and you will see there that we shall be enabled to spend money on councils or committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite so; but my point is how can you take money to pay committees unless you have something to show that committees are going to be set up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It means that the councils may sometimes have 	<i>ad hoc</i> sub-committees with limited terms of reference to whom payment could be extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sorry he is not here to move them. No Member has taken such interest in the part of the Bill which concerns directly women's questions. It seems to me that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
the Committee have three objects in view in this and other kindred Amendments. In the first place, we want to obtain the greatest possible support of the country for the Health Act. For this Amendment I am moving there is a great body of support amongst women of all classes and professions in the country. Only this afternoon, I believe members of the Committee have received a communication from an organisation that represents something like 500,000 women, presided over by a lady whose name is most honourably connected with questions of this kind—Lady Rhondda. I quote that as an instance, showing that for the setting up of a woman's consultative council, there is a desire throughout the country as a whole from organised women's opinion. Then there is our anxiety that all the principal interests in the country, in connection with health questions, should find full representation in the organisation under this Bill, and I think we should all agree that in the case of women we are anxious they should have the fullest and freest opportunity of expressing their views of the various problems covered by this Bill. It may be said that that is already safeguarded under the provisions of the Bill, certain consultative councils are going to be set up, and women may be included in these consultative councils, but that safeguard is not sufficient. I am convinced that without a special women's consultative council the Government will not be able to obtain the woman's point of view as distinct from the man's on these health questions, and, secondly, that without special women's consultative councils women, in the present state of affairs and conditions of public life, will not be on an equality with men in expressing their particular views. In many health questions there is always a woman's point of view, quite distinct from the man's or the general point of view. It may be that in course of time women's views and men's views will be absorbed in each other, but at the moment woman has her own point of view and she should be given the opportunity of expressing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told, for instance, by women well qualified to speak on the subject that in regard to a great many health questions women would rather discuss matters amongst themselves. It may be in the course of time there will a change in that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
respect—I hope there will—but as things are now, upon such questions as, for instance, venereal diseases, women would rather discuss the matter amongst themselves than in a mixed council. I hope, therefore, from the point of view of the Ministry, the President of the Local Government Board will agree to set up a council composed exclusively of women, for the reason that otherwise he will not be in such a good position to obtain the distinctly woman's point of view upon many important health questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I think in the present state of affairs it is necessary from the point of view of women. Here, again, the situation may change, but as things are now and public life as it is, I do not believe that upon these mixed consultative councils women will really obtain the full representation to which their numbers and their interests entitle them. Unfortunately at present there are not a great number of women engaged either in the professions or in public life. Take, for instance, the consultative councils to which the President of the Local Government Board has already alluded, and the case of the consultative council to be composed, principally if not entirely, of members of local authorities. Unfortunately at the present time there are not a great number of women on our local authorities, and I cannot see how on that committee women could be represented in any large degree. That applies equally to the consultative councils proposed to be set up from the medical profession. There again there are not a large number of women in the medical profession, and I cannot see how there can be any large representation of women on such a consultative council composed of doctors. It may be said that in addition to those two specialised consultative councils there is the consumers council, upon which women will be represented. But that, I submit, is insufficient for the reason that male representation will be predominant on the medical council, and on the local authority council, and a woman will have to rest content with a partial representation on the consumers' council. That I think is not sufficient, the more so when we consider that in the majority of these questions women have really a greater interest than men—questions, for instance, concerned with maternity, questions concerned with infantile mortality, and many others. Women
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
whether they have a greater interest or not in these things, anyhow have a very great knowledge of them, and I am most anxious that in launching this Bill, a Bill to which we look forward with the most lively anticipation, we should at the very outset make certain of women being fully represented and of being put upon not a theoretical but a practical equality with men. I hope, therefore, even though there may be theoretical arguments against setting up a council restricted to one sex, the members of this Committee will see that without such a council women will not really obtain that full representation to which I believe all of us are so thoroughly convinced they are entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. THORNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire very warmly to support the Amendment which has been just moved by my hon. and gallant Friend. In his admirable speech on the Second Reading the President described this Bill as an instrument, and we all recognised at the time that what this Bill is going to effect manifestly depends on the way in which the instrument is going to be used, and whether it is going to be used effectually will depend on the assistance the right hon. Gentleman is going to obtain from all those interested in health in the country. I am intensely anxious—as, I am sure, are all the other members of the Committee—that this Bill should be a success and should effect the objects with which it is introduced, but that cannot be done throughout the country unless there is a keen interest taken in it and a strong support for it. I am delighted to see the keen interest displayed in it by women; they are showing a far greater interest in the measure than men are doing, quite naturally, and this formation of a health council with its large and influential membership indicates to me that they are recognising the importance of the measure and their intense desire to promote its success. The one thing I regret in this Committee at the present moment is that in questions such as these we have no women present to express their point of view. A Committee wholly composed of men, surely, would not be so un-gallant as to refuse the request of women to have a committee wholly composed of women. What has been suggested to me as the supreme reason for this special consultative council is this: the wife and mother is, or ought to be, the officer of health for the home, and we want to get
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
the wife and mother in every home keenly interested in the health of that home and, as the object of this Bill is not only to cure disease but even more to prevent it, if we can excite the interest of the mothers and wives keenly in the promotion of health in that direction, we shall have done quite a good thing towards making this Bill a success. It is felt that a council consisting wholly of women, who will be in communication with women in all parts of the country, watching the women's interests, and especially the children's interests, will be able to consult upon these matters better exclusively, alone, than they can in a mixed committee, and, if it is their intense desire to help forward this Bill and they think they can do it best by a council exclusively composed of women, I sincerely hope this Committee will be able to comply with their very strong desire. It is an important matter that women should be able to confer together absolutely alone on so many matters affecting the health, that it seems to me everything is in favour of granting this request, and I hope sincerely that the Committee will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir KINGSLEY WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee will approach this Amendment with the desire to secure in the best possible way the co-operation of women in connection with this measure. It is an important matter, and it is a test which we must apply as to how best this end can be achieved. I would remind the Committee that it is the intention of my right hon. Friend, the President of the Local Government Board, on each of the Committees which he has so far indicated his intention to set up, to give adequate representation to women. An hon. Member rather questioned just now whether it would be possible, for instance, that the committee which would deal with local authorities could give adequate representation to women, on account of the few women who were engaged in public and local administration work to-day. In the first place, I would remind that Gentleman that the council would consist of twenty people, and, if he liked to take London alone, he could find ten women at least who are serving on public bodies. I think there are eight or nine women to-day on the London County Council, and there would be no difficulty at all in giving them the desired representation. Then on the General Administrative Council, which it is also indicated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
should be set up, there would be, of course, ample opportunity to give them adequate representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only fair, I think, that the Committee should be reminded that, while it is true there is this big volume of opinion, regard must be had to the fact that the women's organisations connected with the Labour movement are opposed to this proposal. I saw, on behalf of the President, only a few days ago a large deputation, who told me that they believed the true test for membership of these councils should be, Is he or she the best fitted person to serve on the council, irrespective of sex? It is only fair that that should be pointed out, and the Committee must have regard to it in their decision on this Amendment. It might be said that it is undesirable to have a body of men considering a difficult subject, like venereal disease, and a body of women considering the same subject separately. There have been many conferences quite recently on that very difficult subject, on which women have sat with men, and have expressed valuable opinions in that connection, and I have not myself experienced any difficulties in the many conferences I have attended in connection with the matter. There is a Clause whereby the President has power to appoint sub-committees of any committee, and therefore, if a special question arose, he could appoint the women members already upon any committee, and add to it other women whom he thought desirable, to consider any particular matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRIANT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly familiar with the logical reasons which may be urged against this Amendment, but in life we have to deal not only with logic but with sentiment, which, in nine cases out of ten, is a much more powerful element than logic. I quite agree, not on the grounds of their being women, but upon the grounds of their citizenship, that this claim for the representation of women is one which cannot be evaded. The fact that they have special knowledge, as has been said by my hon. Friend, is a matter to which I do not attach so much importance, because I think all we want is to get the best persons, and the best persons on many of these questions obviously are women. Whatever may be said, one knows one does not get the freedom of expression in any committee consisting of men as well as of women, as one does
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
in a committee consisting purely of men. I was once connected with a particular committee which had to deal with women's questions, but that committee was a failure until all the men were withdrawn from it and the women were left alone. We do not ask women to assist us because they have more knowledge, but because they have different knowledge, and that is the sole ground for asking that they shall have a committee of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good deal less restraint than there used to be in discussing questions. I think it is wise that there should be less restraint. But, nevertheless, there is a certain amount of restraint still, and very naturally, and I am not sure that it is not a very salutary restraint. When one comes to questions of maternity and venereal disease, it does seem to me to be imperative, in the interests of the work which we wish them to do for the nation, that they should be allowed to meet alone. It will not prevent them from presenting any form of report, and that report may very probably have to go to some other committee. But, for the time being, allow them to discuss such questions as they like by themselves. I have seen—and I am speaking from some little experience in these matters—how often there is the necessity for having witnesses. I am confident that, whatever the members of the Committee themselves may think, the average woman outside who is not used to committee work, will simply not give evidence before such a committee if there are men present. Therefore, I do strongly urge—and I do not urge it purely on sentimental grounds, though sentiment does enter into it, but on the grounds of efficiency—that we are more likely to get efficient judgment and advice if we allow this committee, at least for the first few years of its existence, to consist entirely of women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. HARRIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to support this Amendment. I am bound to confess that when I first considered it I was not in the mind to do so. But I should like to give reasons why I think it would be of practical value. The success of our health measures, especially many of those that are now being pressed forward, will depend very much on the amount of public support which they obtain. You may have the most perfect central and local machinery, but unless you are going to get the co-operation of all classes of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
community it will largely fail. Take the example of infant welfare. You may cover the country with infant welfare centres of the most efficient kind, but if the mothers do not bring their babies to the centres where are they? You cannot compel them. A lady complained to me a few days ago that a mother whom she was trying to persuade to bring her baby to the centre said "I do not believe in these schools for mothers, and that sort of thing"; and the worst of it is, so said the lady, she had the public opinion of the street on her side. Now I want that opinion to be on the other side, because this was a very poor street from where all the babies should have been coming to the centre. If you are going to do that you have to get the assistance of the mothers of the working class.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant - Colonel Lord HENRY CAVENDISH - BENTINCK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the husbands, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. HARRIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and the husbands, too, if we can, but with all respect, I think it depends a great deal more on the mothers. You want to get the mothers of the working class on your side. If you are going to do that you have to study their idiosyncrasies, very often their prejudices, and you have to get at the back of their minds. I believe you will only do that by getting the assistance of consultative committees mainly composed of working-class women. I do not believe in committees composed of distinguished men or ladies who are supposed to represent this or that political party. I want to get the women of the working classes. I believe you will not get the best out of a committee unless you have a committee entirely composed of women. I really believe you will get the most practical assistance from a women's committee composed mainly of the working classes, with the assistance of other ladies who are possessed of a special knowledge. I hope we shall have the courage to make a new departure, and not have such a consultative committee as will merely consist of a large number of persons in the higher walks of life and not having the knowledge which is possessed by the working classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major McMICKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a word on this question from the broad point of view. I have listened with great interest to the arguments in favour of the Amendment, and I was not quite sure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
whether the last speaker was agreeable to accept another Amendment which would read "consisting mainly of women." [An HON. MEMBER: "He said so."] Then I am sorry. The view I should like to put forward is this. It seems to me that after a long struggle we have arrived at a time when men and women see more clearly than ever before that the best results are to be obtained by working together. Whichever aspect of the social question has to be considered, it seems to be that to lay stress on the importance of one sex more than the other is reactionary, and it would tend to pull down that constructive spirit of co-operation which has proved of such great value during the critical years through which we have recently passed. In my opinion, these consultative councils should consist of men and women in equal numbers, not only because there ought to be perfect equality between the sexes, but also because I am firmly convinced that a sounder and a more comprehensive opinion would be obtained from bodies which are composed both of men and women than from bodies which are composed entirely of one sex. For these reasons, and this is a broad view, I believe that the whole tendency of to-day is to get men and women to work together. The idea embodied in this Amendment seems to be getting back to the old idea that only one sex can do anything. They ought to work together. I believe this Amendment is reactionary. Therefore, I hope the Government will remain firm. I do not say the sexes should be in equal numbers. I should like to move an Amendment, so that the Clause would read, "whose terms of reference are to deal with matters connected with maternity and infant welfare and infant life protection shall consist mainly of women."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member would wait till we come to that part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is one, I think, that every one of us would rather like to vote for if we could, because it comes with very great force as the considered and strong opinion of very many women who have done and are doing invaluable work, and whose most cordial concurrence is of great importance to the carrying out of this Act of Parliament. But, of course, you cannot put this in the Bill without thereby raising some-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
what similar though not identical matters with regard to the question of other specialised committees. The members of the medical profession, of whom I speak with reverential awe, might not unnaturally be expected to ask for a consultative council composed entirely of doctors. Local authorities, which have their frailties, might quite possibly be tempted to ask for a consultative council composed exclusively of persons with experience of local administration. If the Government and the Committee embark on the path of putting in the Bill definite provisions for councils entirely of one type, I do not think you can easily stop with merely having one which is to be composed exclusively of women. I understand that my right hon. Friend this afternoon, when I was unable to be here, said that there will be on one or more of these councils a predominance of medical men in the one case and a predominance of local administrators in the other. Certainly they would be the better by having a vigorous minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of women are there not two things that we have to keep clear in our minds? It is perfectly obvious there are some details which ought to be discussed by women alone before considered recommendations are made. Would not that more naturally be done on committees or sub-committees of a council? I want frankly to admit that there are things which we all know ought to be discussed by women alone, at any rate at first, before they meet with men of experience in health or local government, and consider what steps they would advise the Ministry to take. But when you come to the position of a council, it is becoming more clear every hour of this discussion that what the Government really mean is to have two or three consultative councils, each of which is doing its detailed work through sub-committees. If that be really what is meant, would it not on the whole be better for the country that one of those councils should consist predominantly of women, but not exclusively so, because when you pass from what I may call committee work—as to which I hope there will be some committees and some sub-committees exclusively composed of women—to the sphere of a consultative council—when you are further away from the detail and nearer to framing the advice you present to the Minister—then I think it would be of real advantage if
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
there were some men of real experience who might form a helpful minority in that council which would predominantly consist of women. I know that in saying this one is saying not only what is unpopular but what one does not want to say, because one's sympathies are in the direction of meeting women who have done such excellent work. But I am told there are artisans' associations who do not like it and oppose it. If that be so, is not the line at once of least resistance and hope to form the council which I am suggesting and see how it works?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that be a view that commends itself to the Committee and the Government, then arises this question: Ought it to be put into the Statute or ought it to be left to the undertaking given by my right hon. Friend? As regards one council composed predominantly of doctors and one council composed predominantly of local administrators, I hope the Committee will be satisfied with the promise of my right hon. Friend. Is it too much to ask those who are making this proposal similarly to be satisfied with an undertaking on the lines I am suggesting if my right hon. Friend would give it? What I feel is that once you go beyond that and put in the Statute express provisions on this head you must have in the Statute express provisions in regard to the other councils which are differently formed. At this stage, especially if we can succeed in getting Orders in Council so modified in procedure as to give opportunities of consideration when they are presented to the House, we could rest on the Minister's assurance. On the whole, I think they could take the view of a predominantly women's council, it being well understood that there would be committees on which women would exclusively serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major FARQUHARSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is evident that this Committee lacks for the moment the opportunity of women's force in this matter. We are here representing the men's point of view; but I would like to draw the attention of the Committee to the allocation of the subjects which will be dealt with, or rather the committees which will be established under this Memorandum—Command Paper 45. The right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board said something to-day as to the contemplated form of the consultative councils. I would ask you to look at page 3 of the document to which I have referred dealing with consultative councils. You will find in the second paragraph.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
four specific groups of subjects referred to. First, medical questions; secondly, questions specially affecting women; thirdly, questions relating to the administration of the National Health Insurance Act; and fourthly, questions of finance. I thoroughly support, after experience, what the hon. Gentleman has said, that woman is the health officer of the home. Not only is she mother and wife, but the home is the pivot of the whole of this State. It is an axiom, in my view, that the child-life of this country should be protected, and I think no one in the home can be more powerful than the woman. Woman is the all-powerful agent in this matter. If you grade into three groups the civilised countries of the world, based upon the increase of infantile mortality, you will find that those countries where women take part in the national administration and local administration have the lowest rate. If you take the second groups, where women have partially obtained local administrative rights, there you have the mean infantile mortality; and in those countries where women have no rights, either local or national, there you have the infantile mortality the highest in the whole civilised world. What better proof could we have than that women should have the first and last voice. I do appeal to this Committee to look at this position without minding about distinctions of sex. Let them have the council, and I am positive no better work could be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we have had a very interesting discussion, and I wanted to hear the general discussion of the Committee before saying anything myself on the matter. It is quite clear that whether we put it in the Bill or whether we do not, there must, of necessity, be certain committees which will be composed for certain purposes solely of women. There will be sub-committees, 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees, and so forth. Clearly this will be so whether you put this in the Bill or not. If any assurance is necessary for that, I have no hesitation whatever in giving it. It is also clear, I think, that with respect to' certain general purposes, at least some council or other will have to consist, at all events, mostly of women. But I must say I should be a little disappointed if the Committee passed this Amendment, because it is going to tie my hands. I am perfectly willing to say here and now that there will be certain committees which will certainly, for various purposes, be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
composed exclusively of women. That must be so. Then they will meet, no doubt, with others, but I do not want, if I can avoid it, to be compelled here and now to set up a certain particular type of council constituted in a particular way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appealed to the Committee earlier in the day to let us learn the best way by dealing with these things, and I am quite sure that this, on the whole, is the best course to take. It is no reflection on the services of men or women. We provide in the Bill that they shall be mixed committees, and I think it is the right and proper way of dealing with it, except in regard to special questions which will arise from time to time, and where you will appoint committees composed exclusively of women as may be required. On a number of questions such as nurses, infancy, women's aspects of venereal diseases, housing—I have already appointed one as a matter of fact—it is clear in many of these things you will have to have for certain purposes committees solely composed of women, and later on they will meet jointly with other bodies, but that is quite a different thing to prescribing that there should continually be in existence a specific council solely composed of women as a special and separate council, and I think it is undesirable. But the rejection of this Amendment, so far as I am concerned, will not diminish by a single individual the number of women whom I shall seek to put on the committees. I recognise that it is absolutely essential to have their complete co-operation, but while that is so, I think this Committee would undesirably tie the hands of the Minister to have a specific council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to think how I would compose it, and if you will think of the practical difficulties I think you will see that what in the end would happen would be this—you would add a number of women to your general and medical committees, and so on, and you would bring all of them together with a few others and make a general women's committee. There is no advantage in that, and I should like to assure the Committee, so far as I am concerned, that it will not make any difference to the fact that we shall constitute committees separately composed of women and seek to have them predominantly on some committees, according as they can bring to bear their special knowledge and advice. That must be the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
guiding principle, and not the question of sex. Given that assurance, I hope that the Committee will not put this provision in the Bill, because if you do I am perfectly certain what will happen—from the information already at my disposal, that either now or on the Report stage I shall be asked to set up about half a dozen other specially named brands of councils, which would be very difficult to resist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not on the basis of sex!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not, but there are other reasons, equally logical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CAIRNS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Man is a prejudiced being. Women are in every respect equal to men. I happen to have a connection with the Royal Infirmary at Newcastle, and I know that if it had not been for women doctors during this War thousands of people who are now alive would be dead. Women are fully qualified to be on this council. Women's brains are equal to men's. Women's courage in this War has been demonstrated to be equal to men's. We have wards set apart specially for women. We have cubicles specially set apart for women, and, as a magistrate, I know we have to put cases entirely into the hands of women. Speaking on behalf of working people, I say the time has come now when working people are going to claim their rights. I am influenced by nobody. I speak of what I know. In this War women have taken their part as splendidly as the men, and I hope they will be placed on a special consultative council. I support this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the remarks of my colleague from the North of England, and I know the work he has done in connection with the Royal Infirmary at Newcastle and other institutions. I must say this Committee is going to be set up in London, which would be very different to committees in the North of England. It is very difficult to bring women away from their families to London. If we decided to set up local committees I would agree with my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CAIRNS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not suggested local committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But my experience is that it is extremely difficult and dangerous to take mothers, especially, away from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
their families and their homes for long distances and time. We hope that a majority of the local committees will to a large extent be constituted of working-class women, but I do not know how it is possible to get such women up to London from the distant parts of the country. It is evident to me that the whole thing is going to be centralised in London, and the hon. Member for Morpeth (Mr. Cairns) should remember that only a certain number can come up from the country. I am in agreement with the hon. Member who said that there should be a mixed committee. The Secretary of the Advisory Committee on the Health Insurance Scheme, in a report which I have seen, has said that on that committee they found the mixed committees were the best, even when they came to consider such questions as maternity, pregnancy, and other subjects affecting women more particularly. I hope the hon. Member will not press his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir S. HOARE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The President of the Local Government Board has made in theory a very strong case. In theory, if you have a committee composed of only one interest, there is no reason why other interests should not ask for similar bodies. But there is all the difference in the world between women and the various interests that when we arrive at the Report stage are likely to come and ask for special representation. We have to look at it from a practical point of view, and while in theory it may be best for the men and women to sit on mixed committees, I am not certain that in practice we shall by that method best enlist the help and experience of women as we would if we were to give them a special Consultative Council ranking with the other Consultative Councils. We want to see that these women have direct access to the Minister, and that the status of the Consultative Council will be such that they will not have to go to ask anyone to put their case for them, but they will be able to go direct to the Minister, especially on questions which are distinctive and of which they have special knowledge. If hon. Members will refer to page 3 of the Memorandum it will be found that it shows that questions specially affecting women are among the three or four big questions with which these Consultative Councils will have to deal. I ask the Committee, therefore, to give these women direct access to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
