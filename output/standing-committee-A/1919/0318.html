I only rise to get some sort of a statement, if possible, out of my right hon. Friend the President of the Local Government Board. This Amendment is practically the same Amendment which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for the University of London (Sir P. Magnus) last time, which the Government did not accept. They said they would consider it, and the President of the Local Government Board said that meanwhile he would have a conversation with his right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Education and that he hoped to be able to accept it on the Report stage. I should very much like if possible that my right hon. Friend should now make a statement and make it quite clear that he has had a conversation with his right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Education, and is really prepared to meet us on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I was not able to be present myself at that time, but I think it might be convenient if, as a result of many conversations with me, the President of the Board of Education were now to make a statement on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PRESIDENT of the BOARD of EDUCATION (Mr. Fisher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I was unable to be present when this matter was brought forward on the last occasion when the Bill was before the Committee. I may, perhaps, say that there is no interdepartmental jealousy between the Department presided over by my right hon. Friend and the Board of Education—[Dr. ADDISON: Hear, hear!"]—and that
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
this is the case is, I think, sufficiently proved by the fact that I was willing to enter into the proposal of my right hon. Friend and to surrender the services of Sir George Newman, the distinguished Chief Medical Officer of Health of the Board of Education, to my right hon. Friend in order that he might have the best assistance possible in starting a better system of health administration. So far from having any jealousy of the new Ministry of Health, the Board of Education is extremely anxious to co-operate with the work of that Ministry in every way possible, but perhaps it would be to the advantage of the Committee if I were to state very briefly my view as to what the relations ought to be between the school medical service on the one hand and the Ministry of Health on the other. I think it would be very difficult and very inconvenient from the administrative point of view, and also injurious from an educational point of view, if the school medical service were cut out of the educational machinery of the country and transferred 	<i>en bloc</i> to a new Ministry of Health. That is the first position which I wish to explain to the Committee. On the other hand, I think it would be equally injurious if the school medical service were not under the suzerainty and general directions of the Ministry of Health, and if it were not reinforced by the weight of the authority properly belonging to that Ministry. I think it would be difficult to cut the school medical service out of the educational machinery of the country. Our system of education is, as the Committee knows, administered by 317 local education authorities. They are interested in education. They are interested in that side of education which deals with the physical welfare of the children. They administer the schools. They appoint the teachers. They appoint the doctors. They control and administer the physical training of the schools. They are responsible for the drainage of the schools, for the hygienic condition of the schools, and they receive grants from the Board of Education to cover their whole activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if the Committee has ascertained the views of the 317 local education authorities as to the proposed transfer of their functions, in respect of the health of the school children, to the Ministry of Health, but I conceive that the attitude of those authorities would be hostile to the proposal, which, I understand, was made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
by the hon. Baronet the Member for the University of London (Sir P. Magnus), and for this very obvious reason. The local education authorities deal now with one Government Department—the Board of Education. They receive grants from that Department. They frame schemes for the educational development of their respective areas, which are submitted to that Department, and their schools are inspected by the officers of that Department. If the health activities of these schools were to be transferred to the Ministry of Health at the present moment, every local education authority would be subject, in respect of its health administration, to two authorities. It would be exposed to two inspections, and I think the local education authorities would view that step with disfavour. Nor would it be very easy to disentangle those portions of the grant which are made in respect of the heating, lighting and drainage, we will say, of the school, those portions which are due in respect of physical training, and those portions which are due in respect of medical inspection. I think there you would meet with a very considerable administrative difficulty. Then there is this further consideration which I would like to put before the notice of the Committee. At the present moment, under present conditions, our local education authorities are not elected 	<i>ad hoc;</i> they are bodies of men who have been elected on general municipal issues. Many of them are interested in education in the strict sense of the term. They are interested in the diffusion of knowledge. Others are not particularly interested in the side of educational work, but are very greatly interested in the physical welfare of the children, and you will find in every local education committee a section which is mainly interested in the work of the schools from the physical point of view. I think it would be unfortunate if these two aspects of national education—the physical aspect on the one hand and the strictly educational on the other—were dissevered. I think both aspects of education would suffer in consequence. I think one of the great sources of strength in the present working of our educational system is that we get a conference of these two extremes of interest in every educational committee of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I think, therefore, it would be inadvisable to cut out the medical side of our educational work from the administrative supervision of the Board of Education—
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
and I think, perhaps, an additional argument is furnished by the tact that the school medical service, although only established in 1907, has been, by the confession of everybody, one of the most successful branches of medical education conducted in this country—while I think that would be a misfortune, at the same time I think it would be an equal misfortune if the administrative work were not carried on under the suzerainty of the Ministry of Health. The position of the Board in urging local education authorities to establish clinics, to improve their system of inspection, or to carry out any of the hundred and one different methods of improving the health of the children, would be enormously strengthened if the Board felt it had behind it the weight of authority of the Ministry of Health, and I feel that with Sir George Newman occupying the dual position of Chief Medical Officer of the Board of Education and also Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health, we have a complete guarantee of the harmonious working of the two systems, and that, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be very much the most practical course to adopt to leave the administration of the school medical service where it is, as an integral part of school life, as an integral part of the functions of the local education committee, and, at the same time, to secure for that system the additional support and sanction of the supervision of the Ministry of Health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better move my Amendment so that there shall be actually an Amendment in the form I want to move it before the Committee, and this is purely a drafting Amendment.

The words "all or any of" really do not convey any sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to say that the speech which has been made by the Presi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
dent of the Board of Education has disappointed me very much indeed. I do not see that it in the least carries out the hopes that were held out to us the last time we met. I do not think we have got any further. I do not in the least understand what my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Education means by the word "suzerainty." He says that under this principle there will be two masters, but we want to get rid of the two masters. We want to put these children under the one health authority, and I do not think he has got us out of this difficulty at all. So far as I can see, the suzerainty is a mere shadow, and the whole of the real power, if we do what my right hon. Friend suggests, would rest with the Education authority, and the Ministry of Health would simply be represented by some gentleman—very distinguished, no doubt — who will sit occasionally at the Board of Education. I must say I am very disappointed indeed. I think it is enormously important that we should get these children between the ages of five and fifteen or sixteen under the Ministry of Health. As I said last time, I would rather see them than any other section of our population under the Ministry of Health, because I believe that, if you can build up the health of these young persons between the ages of five and fifteen or sixteen it will enormously improve the health of the population in after years. I do not say in the least it is the fault of the Board of Education; but look at the state of the teeth of the younger population at the present day. The Board of Education has not done anything, I do not say it is their fault; I do not think they have been able to do it, but they have done absolutely nothing whatever. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Well, very little. I think if you take percentages you will find that an enormous percentage of the population of this country have got bad teeth. Anyway, I am not at all satisfied with what my right hon. Friend has said, and I beg to move my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TREVELYAN THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support this Amendment. It seems to me that not only is the position made worse than indicated at the last meeting of this Committee, but from the speech of the President of the Board of Education it is infinitely worse than outlined in the Bill itself. All the arguments the Presi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
dent of the Board of Education used against the change taking place now are equally applicable against the change taking place at any time. It was distinctly foreshadowed in the Bill that, it was hoped, eventually the matter would be so adjusted so that the full powers of medical inspection under the Education Acts should be transferred to the Ministry of Health. It seems to me that what has been said cuts at the whole 	<i>raison d'êre</i> of the Bill. If we are not to have unity of authority for the health of the children you might as well drop the Bill altogether. One hesitates to criticise the President of the Board of Education, but it seems to me the difficulties that he has foreshadowed, although they may be great at the central department, are very largely imaginary with regard to local authorities. It has been my privilege to be a member of a local health committee for fifteen years. I have been on the education committee dealing with the health and education of the school children ever since that committee was formed. I do not know what other authorities may do, but our medical officer under the health committee is also the head of the medical inspection of the school children. He is supported by the education authority and works under the medical officer of health for the borough. But you have a divided authority. You find under the education authority—I can speak freely because I am one of that education authority—that the director of education naturally has more regard for school attendances of the children than for the health side. Where in the interests of health the children should be kept away from school for fear of infection and so on, or for any other purpose, the education authority naturally is anxious to maintain their attendances in order to keep up their records. Therefore you have a conflict of interests which is not in the interests of health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to Sir George Newman. If hon. Members would read what he has said they will find that he has criticised very severely the laxity and slowness of the education authorities in getting on with the medical inspection work. I know they have done something. The hon. Member who spoke before me referred to the care of the teeth, which has been steadily neglected in certain districts, though in others a certain number of dental operators have been appointed to look after the teeth of the children.

	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
Taking, however, the country as a whole, the work has been lamentably deficient. Take another question, that of open-air schools. We have been urged to have these established throughout the country, yet you will find comparatively few out of the 300 education authorities who have established these open air schools. The interests of the education authority are primarily, on account of old association, with education pure and simple, and not with the health of the children. If you are to have real regard for the health of the children, you will strike a fatal blow if you do not allow that unity of control which will put the interest of health first and primarily. I would just like to say with regard to any possible opposition which local authorities might raise that the same argument would hold good in respect of boards of guardians. You are taking away the powers of the boards of guardians and transferring them to the Ministry of Health, not because they did not object. If you consult the education authorities you will find that they would object. But you should have regard to the larger issue, the health of the children, who, from one to five come under the Ministry of Health. You take out of the way all over five and up to fifteen, place them under the school medical officer, and a different set of authorities. Whatever suzerainty you may have you will not get that unity of purpose, which is the aim of this Bill, unless you have undivided control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir SAMUEL HOARE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my two hon. Friends in the arguments they have urged, and because of certain other arguments that appeal to me from the educational side. It seems to me, looking at the matter purely from the educational side, that it is much better to free the education services from all primarily non-educational duties—for this reason, if for no other—to free the education rate from the heavy charge upon it which is not really for education at all. Before we come to a decision upon this Amendment, I should very much like to hear the opinion of some of the representatives of some of the bigger local authorities. It seems to me that the President of the Board of Education went far too far with his argument. He seemed to me to go so far as practically to leave any department that is in any way connected with health outside the scope of this Bill. That,
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
if carried to any extent, would make this Bill perfectly futile. Even the President of the Board of Education himself, when he was giving evidence before the Committee of the Ministry of the Reconstruction on the machinery of government seemed to agree that this service should be transferred to the Ministry of Health. These are his words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Assuming that a Ministry of Health is established hereafter, I think that the Ministry will, in due course, take over, or supervise, the medical functions now entrusted to the school medical service."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FISHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or supervision!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir S. HOARE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that point in a moment. Surely the time to take over these services is when we are introducing a Bill dealing with health all over the country. As to supervision, the President of the Board of Education said it would be all right, because Sir George Newman will be representing both Departments. Sir George Newman is, as we all know, one of our distinguished public servants who has done more for health than practically anybody in this country. That is all very well, so long as Sir George Newman is there. But Sir George Newman will not be there for ever. It does seem to me to be a fine basis on which to put the argument that these services should be left to the Board of Education because a particular Civil servant is to be entrusted to see that there is not to be friction between the two services I myself should like to see this service immediately transferred to the Ministry of Health, both for the reasons given by the hon. Member opposite, and also for the further reason that I think it would be much better from the educational point of view that all services of health that are not primarily educational should be handed over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir PHILIP MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also felt some disappointment at the speech of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Education. May I refer to the words of the Minister in charge of this Bill when it was considered on Thursday last here. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think I am probably right in saying that there is a general feeling in the Committee that the Government ought to accept this proposal."</p></blockquote>
That was the proposal I then made. I feel certain that if a Division had been taken at that time the majority of Members of the Committee would have approved of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
the Amendment. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!] The hon. Gentleman further said the President has, of course, repeated the statement, as we all know:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no jealousy between the two Departments on the subject, and if the hon. Baronet will withdraw his Amendment, I will recommend my right hon. Friend to carry this out on the Report stage."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 13th March, 1919, col. 67, Vol. 1.]</p></blockquote>
With that definite statement on the part of the Minister then in charge of this Bill I must own that the speech of the President of the Board of Education has come as a disappointment to nearly all the members of this Committee. As my hon. Friend who moved this Amendment rightly said, the argument used by the President of the Board of Education goes to the very root of the existence of this Bill altogether, because the object of this measure, as defined by all those who are interested in it, is to take over the health services from the different Departments of State in which they are now carried on so as to consolidate them and prevent overlapping. Surely the argument of the President of the Board of Education would apply to every other service which it is proposed to take over. May I refer to the very last document issued by the British Medical Association and the Ministry of Health. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal is that a Ministry of Health should be created to take over from the existing Government Departments all such duties as are concerned with the health of the community."</p></blockquote>
Surely those duties which are at present carried out by the Board of Education are duties concerned with the health of the community, and if the Ministry of Health is not to take over those duties this Committee might just as well adjourn, because I see no reason whatever why the Committee should continue to discuss the question. With the great ability always shown by the President of the Board of Education in bringing forward any argument, I notice that he referred to the physical education of the children as an important matter for the Board of Education to consider. That is so, and to a certain extent I see no reason why the physical training of the children in gymnastics and other exercises should not remain with the Board of Education. It is only justifiable that they should. It does not require all the skill that will be at the service of the Ministry of Health to determine whether the exer-
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
cises to which the children in the schools are subjected are on the whole healthy or not. Look at what this Bill contains. It provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be lawful for His Majesty from time to time by Order in Council, to transfer from the Minister to any other Government Department any of the powers and duties of the Minister."</p></blockquote>
This applies with respect to the medical treatment of young persons, and surely all the arguments used by the President of the Board of Education would apply equally whenever the Ministry of Health proposed to take over these duties. The question of time does not come in. It is either right or it is not right to take over those duties. The President of the Board of Education has endeavoured to show that it would be wrong to take over those duties, that it would interfere with the general education of the children, and that it would be unwelcome to the education authorities throughout the country. Those arguments would equally apply six months hence as well as now.

Let us notice another point in this proposal. It does not speak exclusively of the physical exercises of the children, but with respect to the medical inspection and treatment of children and young persons. Can we for one moment suppose that it is any part of the duty of the Board of Education to undertake not only the medical inspection, but the treatment of children over the age of five and young persons between the ages of twelve and sixteen. Surely if we are to leave to the Board of Education an important duty such as that there is no object in having a Ministry of Health whatever. To my mind it does interfere and will interfere more seriously in the future, with the important functions which the Board of Education has to discharge, if under the new Clause in the Act of 1918 with regard to continuation schools it shall be the function of the Board of Education to inspect young persons between the ages of twelve and sixteen, and treat them when they are unwell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does this mean? Instead of unifying the control of health throughout the country you will have to set up a complete medical service under the Board of Education which will overlap that under the Ministry specially charged with looking after the health of the children. I sincerely hope that we may soon go to a Division, and that we shall not be long detained over this question, seeing that it has already been very fully discussed. If we

	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
are compelled to go to a Division by the acceptance of the Amendment now proposed, I hope we shall have a large majority in favour of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir RYLAND ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I was unable to hear the first part of the speech of the President of the Board of Education, but this controversy is one with which every member of this Committee is only too familiar, and I imagine that at any rate we should all be agreed upon this point that there are perfectly genuine arguments on both sides of this controversy, and that the work of education in the country and the work of public health cannot by any Bill, and still less by any Order in Council—the fashionable prophylactic of the moment — be entirely separated. What we are asked to do is to decide whether the duty of medical inspection and the treatment of boys and girls for ten years of their lives shall be in the hands of the Minister of Health, or whether they shall be in the hands of the Minister of Health for part of each day and the whole of each night, and in the hands of the Minister of Education during certain selected hours of the day. That is dividing the youthful life a little too sharply, and on the whole, although fully realising that no solution can be free from objection, I would respectfully ask the Government and the Committee to arrange for the transfer of those powers to the Ministry of Health at once under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say with great respect that I think the argument which centres round the great personality of Sir George Newman is constitutionally a bad argument. One can understand a responsible Minister of the Crown having within his Ministry two or more great Departments only slightly connected. Some of us imagine that may be the outcome of the Minister of Ways and Communications Bill. We know it to be the case in the Home Office and the Treasury; in fact, it is a well-known feature of constitutional Government, but to have two great Ministries united, not in the person of the Cabinet Minister responsible to Parliament, but in the person of one eminent Civil servant who owes intelligent obedience to both, is bad in principle and unworkable in practice. However free from jealousy and all human frailties the Presidents of these two Boards may be there will certainly be moments in which they will not see eye to eye, and which then is the tortured Sir George
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
Newman to obey and follow. That will not do, and if that is the only argument suggested as an alternative to the Motion of my hon. Friend, surely the Amendment holds the field. I think I may say with great confidence that my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Education, in that part of his speech which I have heard, I will not say confused, but rather blended the side of the problem at Whitehall with the side of the problem in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are men, useful though despised, who are constantly under the duty of serving not only two but many masters, and they are the members of local authorities. We have to bow with equal ardour at the shrine of the Local Government Board, the Board of Education, now the Ministry of Health, and ultimately the Ministry of Ways and Communications. We have to practise what I may call administrative Pantheism carefully, but it has this advantage, that we do in practice know that we have to balance and adjust the legitimate claims and directions of different Departments of the State. I am not going to trouble the Committee with recollections of many hours spent on county council, public health, and education committees. I would merely say, as far as my experience goes, it can really only affect my own opinion—that I believe it would be quite easy, if medical inspection and treatment were under the Ministry of Health, to adjust with the Education Committee, at any rate, in the counties the proper medical inspection of schools and school children with the complete medical service of public health in the country. As it is, we have to have constant communication between the Public Health Committee and the Education Committee over the question of midwives and their training, over the question of tuberculosis, and over other things, and nothing which can be done will prevent the need of constant intercommunication. I merely say that as far as I am competent to judge, I believe that intercommunication would be helped and not hindered if the Amendment were supported by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am only speaking individually, although one has discussed it with many people, but I should like to say that the following Amendment standing in the name of the hon. and gallant Member for Durham (Major Hills) and myself, in which we ask the Ministry of Health to take over the powers and duties of the Board of Education with regard to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
deficient and defective children is the unanimous request of the Parliamentary Committee of the County Councils Association. We find in practice that for children to be under the Board of Control until they are five, then in the hands of the Education Committees who are really very puzzled to know what they are to do with them, and then to be sent back at sixteen to the Board of Control does not give the unhappy people the chance that they ought to have of being trained to lead tolerable lives. I believe that this is the desire of the bulk of County administrators, and, although there is real difficulty in the matter, I think the majority of persons whose experiences are analogous to mine would support the view that I am laying before the Committee, and I do hope that the Government will accept my assurance that if they accept this Amendment there will not be administrative difficulties locally, whatever delicacy of adjustment there may be at Whitehall, a delicacy of adjustment which is bound to arise whenever a new Ministry is established, but which I am perfectly certain that the high qualities of the persons concerned will easily overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The discussion up to the moment has certainly gone rather all one way, and perhaps it may be desirable to point out to the Committee some of the considerations which were in our minds when we framed the Bill as it is. All of those considerations mentioned by the hon. Members who have spoken were certainly discussed most carefully, and I had the advantage of discussing many of them, though not all, I agree, with the important representative bodies of the great Local Government authorities. The Amendment before the Committee is that we should forthwith transfer all the duties—the hon. Member has missed out the words "or any"—of the President of the Board with respect to this matter to the Minister of Health. The first reason why this part of the subject was placed in the second category in the Bill is the first reason why I would urge the Committee not to adopt the Amendment in the form in which it is moved. If hon. Members will look at the Bill they will see that there are two categories of services: first, those that are to be transferred forthwith, and secondly, those all or any of which it shall be lawful to transfer hereafter. The reason for those two categories is this: In getting together
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
the framework and organisation of the Ministry of Health it would be a great mistake to thrust every duty upon the Minister straight away, because he would become overloaded, and the administrative machine might tend to break down. Therefore, in the first place, we concentrated upon the Minister those things in the first category which, as the Committee will see, relate to children in infancy, midwives, and the general services of the country as discharged by the local health authorities, the insurance committees, and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next step in our health development clearly is to frame a health policy and to put before Parliament proposals for local health agencies, either with respect to clinics, laboratories, nurses, midwives, or what not. All those are embraced within the category immediately transferred to the Minister. That is really a gigantic task to place upon the shoulders of the Minister forthwith. It is clearly the first task to be undertaken, and it is really because the task of framing a health policy and bringing before Parliament, as I hope that we shall be able to do in the very near future, proposals with regard to the services to be set up is so prodigious in itself that I would ask the Committee not to burden the Ministry at the outset with having to discharge all these other functions as well That is the first reason for having the two classes, and I think it is a thoroughly sound reason. It is the practical and businesslike way of doing it. In the second category we put in the words "all or any," and the hon. Member proposes to omit the words "or any." It will be observed by the Committee that the words "or any" do not appear in the first category. In the first group of services to be transferred those words do not appear. You transfer 	<i>en bloc</i> certain powers and duties. The reason the words "or any" are in this second class of services is because I am sure that when we come to examine them in detail we shall all recognise that with respect to each one of them there are some services or some powers or some duties which it would not be either practicable or expedient to transfer. I do not think that the wisdom of putting in the words "or any" with regard to the educational services could have been illustrated better than by the few short speeches that we have had this morning. For example, I agree with the hon. Member for London University (Sir P. Magnus) that physical training which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
is clearly directed to improving the health and vigour of the children, should not be divorced from education itself. It may be the prejudice of one's training, but I regard it as important a branch of education as teaching a child a certain number of educational subjects. He is much better able to be a good citizen afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But surely physical training is not included in the powers which we propose to transfer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my point. Physical training is a part of education, but how can you divorce physical training from inspection? You cannot. I say with great respect that it is an administrative impossibility. You lay down certain systems of physical training and your inspection is designed to show what is the condition of the children's health. Surely you learn from the inspection what is the result of the physical training and whether the methods that are being adopted are the right methods. I do not think it is really an administrative possibility nor that it would be a wise step to take to separate the considerations relating to the inspection of children from the considerations which relate to oversight, supervision and the setting up of standards in the courses of physical training. That would not be possible. All I am saying now is that that is the justification for the words "or any." We have to consider what is practical and possible, and therefore we must have some saving words. It is not going to help, I am sure, either the President of the Board of Education or myself simply o throw these duties holus bolus upon us without discrimination, and therefore I suggest that the words "or any" are clearly necessary. In the next place the hon. Member for Wood Green spoke, for example, of the gross deficiency of our services with respect to attending to the teeth of the children. I entirely agree with every word he said, but it will clearly be a duty of a Minister of Health in formulating the policy of his health services to have regard to that consideration, not with regard to children's teeth only, but with regard to the teeth of people generally. When we come to the stage of development of our health services which relates to that form of treatment, it is clear that we shall have to have one unit of administration, one system of service. It is obvious that you would not have separate treatment
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
arrangements for a child who happens to be five years and a month and a child who happens to be four years and eleven months. That clearly would be an administrative absurdity. But that is a justification for having the words "or any." Clearly functions of that kind, when you come to develop your system of medical service as applied in the local area of administration, would be under the Minister of Health, and therefore some of the services which relate, let us say, to the treatment side, would have to be consolidated into the general scheme of service. But that is another justification for the Bill as it stands. I would suggest with great respect that with regard to administrative possibilities we should be left to sort out the things which it is possible and practicable and right to attach to the general scheme of health service, dealing with them as a whole, and not to root out without consideration of what is practical and useful all and everything which is now dealt with under these headings by the local education authority. It is quite plain to me that as a matter of administration some of the functions relating to the education services, and the general supervision of their administration, must be left to the people who are concerned with the life of the school, while certain others as we develop our services, will become properly attached to the general health services of the country. That is why this is put in the first place in the second category, and why it is in the second place that the words "or any" are put in, and I believe they are thoroughly sound reasons. Let me place one other consideration before the Committee. Take the simple administrative question of the life of the school. The hon. Member for Middleton and Prestwich, whose vast experience in this matter we all recognise, says that it would be practicable to separate certain of these services from others. I agree. But it does not necessarily follow that it would be practicable and easy to separate them all, which the Amendment is asking us to do. Take questions of inspection, the times of physical training classes and so forth. Those questions have to come in with the general work of the school. The general machinery of the conduct and government of the school concerns many of these services. I suggest that it is not practicable, with respect to many of these sections, to take them out and put them under the charge
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
of somebody else, and I do urge the Committee to leave us to put forward our scheme in connection with the development of our local health services in the second stage of these proposals. Then it would appear what responsibilities should attach to the Minister of Health with regard to their supervision and where his limits would end. I agree with the hon. Member for Middleton and Prestwich that nothing you can do in an Act of Parliament, or in—to use that delicious phrase of his—that panacea for all our ills, an Order in Council, will ever succeed in disentangling these things in a clear and logical manner. You have got to have sensible and practical men administering them. But, for all that, I am quite sure that whether you look at it from the point of view of the development of our health services, or from the point of view of treatment, it is wise to put those services into the second category of the Bill, and that, secondly, it is wise to have the words "or any," because it is clear that with respect to some services it would be practically and administratively useless to transfer them 	<i>en bloc</i> to somebody else. I am not putting myself against the spirit of the Committee or of the hon. Member, I am sure. I want these things done properly as much as he does. That is why we have spent so much time during the last two years working out this Bill. And I may say that nobody has helped me more than my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Education, who was the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, and who helped to put this Bill into its present form. But we are trying to approach the matter from the point of view of what is practicable and expedient, and I suggest with great respect that the proper course is the course suggested in the Bill, leaving this matter in the second category and leaving us to select some of the powers and not all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir EDGAR JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only fair that a few words should be said on the other side. I think that if the Committee is patient this matter can be accommodated and worked out, and I hope the Committee will support the Minister in charge of the Bill in being allowed to have time to work this problem out. I agree that as soon as possible Sir George Newman should be under one authority. I have no doubt that as far as the doctors themselves are concerned, the control of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
doctors in the localities, and probably some of the clinics that have already been set up by education authorities, can eventually be put under the Ministry of Health and you can get the control from the purely medical side. But let us look at the other side, at the practical side of it, as to how it will work out. What happens now? The doctor calls round only once in a way; he goes round the school and makes a general inspection of the children. He is not there every day or every week and never will be. The hon. Gentleman has referred to this question as treatment, but that is all that is being done in the schools since the Board of Education took it up. This word "treatment" under the existing Act covers the whole of the operations, and I must say that in many districts in the country—I am proud to say it of the mining districts where I live—an enormous work has been done of a beneficial character by the education committees. I agree that if your treatment involves bottles of medicine and the treatment of the child at home, when the child is told that it must not attend school, that is a thing you can have under the Ministry of Health, but the great bulk of the treatment which has been so beneficial is treatment carried out day by day by the school teachers in the school under the direction of the education authority. Let us take the question of teeth. Already two areas that I know very well are tackling the question of the teeth by instructions to the teachers. They are starting in the infant school, where they can begin at a proper age, and they have given instructions that the teachers are to put the infants through a toothbrush drill every morning. Who is to give the instructions to the teachers? Is it an official of the Ministry of Health? Obviously the teacher must take his instructions from the education authority. He cannot take them from anybody else. [Sir P. MAGNUS: Why?] Because you will get dual instruction. Take the question of ventilation. I know this is a practical question that actually arises. I know of a terrible row that happened, one teacher being suspended for a certain period of time over a dispute between the doctor, who was in that district under the medical officer, and the schoolmaster, as to a particular question of the degree of ventilation of a class room on a cold winter's day. You have to leave these things under one authority. Then take the question of physical training. One would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
think we were back again in the old days when people believed that medical treatment consisted in bottles of medicine entirely, but everybody knows that the modern system of treatment relies more upon the care of the children and upon physical education, and who is to lay down the particular type of drill for the children of different ages in your gymnasium or in your school? Who is to give instruction to the teacher? Is it to be the teacher's usual authority, or some other man who comes in? I can see a new officer under the Ministry of Health walking in and saying to the teacher, "What is this system of physical drill you have here? It is all wrong, and you must drop it." The teacher says," The education authority has drawn up this scheme." And you will get practical difficulties of that kind all round. I do not say they cannot be overcome, but you cannot plunge today here in this Committee and neglect the advice of the Minister to give him time in which to work these details out, so that we shall have coordination. Surely we ought to allow time. After all, the local authorities are now the municipal authorities, and they will be responsible for the health committees as well as the education committees. Surely the least we can do on this question of administrative detail and difficulty is to give a chance to the municipal people amongst themselves to think this thing out. I strongly support the line the Minister has taken, and I hope the Committee will not plunge into a cut-and-dried thing like this, which will create immediate confusion in every school in the country and upset a good deal of the excellent work that has been done since the education authorities have been on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SIMM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As against the statement of the last speaker, we have the evidence of the hon. Member for Middlesbro', speaking for the towns, and I want to ask the Committee to try and realise what would happen in a colliery district. It is well known that doctors differ, and it is not always a good thing for the patient, and there is such a thing again as what we know as medical etiquette, another bad thing for the patient. I have known lives lost through that coming into play. As the thing stands at the moment, if the Amendment is not carried I presume we shall have one doctor attending the child in the home and another doctor attending
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
the child when it is at school. I believe that is a most undesirable thing, and therefore in our colliery districts where inspection is very necessary I think there ought to be one authority and not two men of two different minds dealing with the same subject, and for that reason I hope the Committee will support this Amendment. I believe there is a great need, especially in the colliery districts for the clothing of this Bill. We are dealing, as it were, only with the skeleton of the Bill now, and the full clothing will come afterwards, but this is the most important branch of the health of our people, this question of treatment between the ages of five and fifteen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir WATSON CHEYNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say how disappointed I was in the speech of the President of the Board of Education. I had a very high opinion of him before. I said to myself "If there is anyone who will take an open-minded view it is the President of the Board of Education." I know the President of the Local Government Board has a very difficult task here, because he is up against interests which are extremely difficult to root out, and that is why I thought our friend would take such a very long view and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say that really there has been no interest which has influenced my judgment on this matter. There is no Department in the whole of the negotiations over this Bill that has ever suggested opposing interests. The Board of Education has never suggested it, and I have had no difficulty with that Department at any time. It is not from the point of view of interest that I have tried to put my case fairly before the Committee. It is from the point of view of conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. CHEYNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that those interests had prevailed, but we had the President pointing out the local interests which would tell very much against the transference of these powers when it came to the point, and I know it is extremely difficult. However, leaving that question alone, there has been a great deal said about time, that the President of the Local Government Board wants time. There is no question of time in the phrasing of the Subjection which provides that certain powers shall be transferred. It does not say "forthwith," and there is not a word about time, and one naturally does not expect the Minister of Health to do every-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
thing at once. There is not a word in the Amendment or anywhere else about time. We will give him such time as he likes, but he will observe that I have put down an Amendment later on to bring all these things up under the first proviso. The reason I did that—I suppose, perhaps, it is the depression following "flu"—but I lost my usual trustful disposition, and I became very suspicious about this division into two clauses. I was not thinking of the question of time at all. I was wondering whether it was hoped they would ever come under the medical authority, and I was still more suspicious because I saw they were to come in in a different way, that is, by Order in Council, which, of course, might never be asked for, and never be brought in. That is the reason I wanted them all put under one thing, not that they should forthwith be brought in, but that we should know that they would be ultimately brought under the aegis of the Ministry of Health. So that I do not think there is anything whatever in this question of forthwith. I do not think the mover of the Amendment wants it to be brought in immediately or in any particular order. Now the question comes as to the difficulty of bringing it in. I confess I cannot see the difficulty—in fact, I think there is very little will happen. It will happen that the medical officers will report to the medical officer under the Ministry of Health instead of the medical officer under the Board of Education. I believe the time will come when alterations will be made with a view to economising medical services and unifying them, but I think for a time there will be no sudden upset of arrangements, no general disturbance brought about. I believe the whole thing will settle down easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good deal has been said about physical training. Physical training is a medical matter. It is not an educational matter, and I think that the Inspector will consider whether the best form of physical training is being used in the school or not, and we wish him to report to the Minister of Health and say that he. is satisfied or is not satisfied. I am not. very sure I would quite trust the schoolmaster to arrange the physical training of the boys without a certain amount of medical supervision. I have come up against schoolmasters a good deal in my time in this sort of way. I have done operations. Take the operation of the radical cure of hernia during a
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
boy's holiday. I have sent him back with a note to the school that he was not to play football or cricket, or do any severe exercise during the next term; but the schoolmaster receives the boy, who is perhaps one of his most promising cricketers, and he is afraid his house will not do so well during the term if this boy is laid up, and he begins to write me letters and protest against my decision that this boy is not to play. I have had the thing over and over again. If the schoolmaster cannot move me he moves the parents, and they come down on me, and do not understand the point. My point is not that the boy is not perfectly well in health, but he has to depend on a scar which must take some time to solidify, and if he goes in for strenuous exercise he will stretch that scar, and my operation will be spoilt. There are other cases such as curvature of the spine. It is right that the medical officer should have a say in the matter, and it should not be left entirely to the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the difficulties at the periphery, I, of course, personally am not very well acquainted with it, but I am informed that usually the chief medical officer of education authority is at the same time the chief medical officer of health, so that it is a unity of work. It exists, and I cannot see that there would be any great difficulty. Besides, I would take the strong view of saying that if there is any difficulty, we have got to get the best thing, and if it does hurt the feelings of the local authorities, I am afraid they must make up their minds to be hurt. I do not believe myself that it will really matter very much to them at all whether the authority is the Ministry of Health or the Board of Education. I shall certainly support this Amendment, because it does not specify time, it does not hurry on the Minister to do the thing at once, and it is only just taking the first paragraph of my own Amendment which comes later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FISHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat tremulous in imposing myself a second time on the Committee, seeing that my first speech created such general disappointment, but I hope that before I sit down I shall be in a position to make a proposal which will somewhat mitigate the bitter feelings which prevail around me; I, like the hon. Member who has last addressed us, and who has such very large experience of medical matters, am only anxious that the best thing, should be done, and I felt, as I have listened to this discussion, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
there seemed to be a very general impression that if you put the schools under the Ministry of Health, the health of the children was secured, whereas, if you retained them under the Board of Education, their health was necessarily imperilled. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I merely wish to remind the Committee that the school medical service has been a most successful branch of medical administration, and I submit that the Committee should think a little carefully before it interferes with an organisation which is doing magnificent work, which has secured the confidence of all the local authorities, and which is going on fast from strength to strength. I would further remind the Committee that, under the Education Act of 1918, very special stress was laid upon the physical side of education. For the first time, a scheme of physical education has been imposed upon boys and girls of the country right through the period of adolescence, and we hope very much that the local education authorities, who, under the provisions of the new Act will be required to submit comprehensive schemes for the intellectual and physical education of all of the children in their respective areas, will be stimulated by this prospect to make a far more ample provision than they have hitherto done for the physical well-being of the children in their schools. We are, therefore, particularly anxious not to interfere with work which is now successfully going on, and which is about to receive fresh encouragement through the Education Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on the subject of physical training, may I remind the Committee that the Board of Education now encourages the appointment of organisers of physical training, by giving the local education authority a Grant-in-Aid, and the type of man that we hope to see as the physical organiser—in fact, such men have already been appointed — is a man who is not merely a gymnast but who has some knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and remedio-gymnastics, and who will be able to correct, by an intelligent system of physical training, all those physical defects which the one-sided activities that are stimulated by our repetition processes in our industries necessarily provoke. Only the other day I visited a new continuation school which has been started in connection with a great factory in the north of England, and there physical training was carried on—much of it remedial—for the purpose of correcting the physical dis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
tortions which are the inevitable result of our present industrial processes. Is that an activity that should come under the Board of Education, or is it an activity that should come under the Ministry of Health?.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>HON. MEMBERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no!

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BARNES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with a very great deal of interest and appreciation to the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, but we do not seem to get very much further after hearing it. Those of us who are not really experts or doctors must feel, after hearing what we have on this point, that we are up, not against questions of detail, but of principle affecting the whole Bill. I am bound to say that the Minister in charge of the Bill has been a little unfortunate in his ally this morning. If we had not had the President of the Board of Education here and heard his speeches, we might have been inclined to let the Clause stand. But we hear two entirely distinct arguments from these two gentlemen. The one in charge of the Bill says "not now"; the President of the Board of Education "or ever." That, it appears to me, cuts at the very root of that for what we are fighting. If this Bill has any appeal or any attraction at all for the general community it is in the idea that we are going to get
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
under this Ministry of Health an authority which is going to unify and co-ordinate everything in this country which stands for health. If we are to begin by a process of emasculation we shall leave, instead of the fine figure of health which may, like that fine statue of Liberty which dominates the entrance to New York, something more in the nature of those scarecrows which we see in the fields on our journeys from the north to this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is of real importance here is that on this point we are up against the very first question of the extension of the powers of the Ministry of Health. Following on this Sub-section (2) 	<i>a</i> we get 	<i>b</i> dealing with the Ministry of Pensions, and 	<i>c</i> the Secretary of State under the Lunacy Acts, and so on. I myself feel that if we give way here, if we allow the President of the Board of Education to rescue his Department from the clutches of the Ministry of Health we shall have established a precedent for everybody else that we have to deal with. There is no question at all about it. If you look at this first category what do you see? You see in the Ministry of Health that we have the powers and duties of the Local Government Board transferred which were under the control of the Minister who drew up this Bill. We have the powers and duties of the Insurance Commissioners. When you come to education all you get from education is the power dealing with children who are not attending the schools. Then you get a fragment torn from the hands of the Privy Council, and some portion torn from the Secretary of State. When you get anything really substantial, when you get any real powers vested in a real solid department, you find they are all put into the second category. Having got into that second category, they are further weakened by the insertion of these words "or any." If we had not had the debate this morning we might possibly have passed these Clauses, but it is perfectly clear from what is coming out that the real thing we have to do this morning is to strengthen the Ministry of Health, whatever it may be, and to let the Departments of State, who, after all, are only servants of Parliament, realise that we cannot allow any Departmental friction, jealousy, or little susceptibilities to stand in the way of a great conception. I have heard nothing this morning that will lead me to do anything else than to support the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir COURTENAY WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should wish to make one or two very short remarks. It seems to me that the Minister in charge of the Bill made out a very good case for the Bill, if the President of the Board of Education had not distinctly stated that he was not prepared to give these powers over in the future. It was quite clear in all these Bills that the Minister comes here to take powers over from the local authorities, and that is all right; but the moment there is another Department concerned that other Department gets up and fights. He cannot get the powers which are necessary for his action. If this Bill is to be any use at all, the whole of the health of the country must be in the hands of the Minister of Health. Can there be anybody more important to the health of the country than the children at school? The physical training tale is a red herring. Physical training has got to be inspected by the doctor, and that inspection will have to be under the health authorities. You might as well argue, as some have in regard to the regulations against children being overworked—for the doctor has to report upon that subject. The true view is that the Board of Education Officer will make his report, and if there is a flagrant case of transgression in what ought to be done by the teachers of the Board of Education the Board of Education will be brought to book. They are not omnipotent. They will have to take the report, and will have to act according to the medical reports, whether they come from their own Department or from the Department of someone else. Other people have to do it. I am sure when we are to have a Bill to deal with the health of the country, and such things as the health of the children who are at school, or out of school, that it must be under the Ministry of Health. I hope the Amendment will be accepted. If there is any difficulty about the times instead of "forever" or "forthwith" I shall beg to insert "six months."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no time in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there will be no difficulty in the time: "forthwith" has been taken out. It is rather important I think that there should be a time limit where the two Departments are working together. I should like to see some time limit, say of six months, so that these two Departments should not work to block the working of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir JOHN HOPE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help contrasting the Government official attitude on this Bill with that of the attitude taken up upon the Ways and Communications Bill. In the latter measure the new Minister is anxious to take over large and comprehensive powers and pressure is being put upon him to withdraw some of his demands, whilst here the new Minister of Health is not anxious to take over full powers or large and comprehensive powers. I cannot help thinking that this difference can be accounted for, because in the Ways and Communications Bill you are taking over powers from private individuals and companies, whilst here you are transferring powers and duties from one Department to another. Consequently I cannot but be a little suspicious of the jealousy of these various Departments and the dead hand making difficulties over this matter. The country demands that the Ministry of Health Bill should be a large and comprehensive one, dealing with health in all its features. A special feature of the last election was how keen the women votors were that a Ministry of Health should be established, and they wished it particularly to be established on behalf of the children. If you are going to leave out the health of the children between five and fifteen, practically you leave out the question of their health altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard no arguments put forward against handing over at once which will not equally apply to ever handing them over. As a matter of fact one speaker has already said that there would be two medical officers attending the children, one in the home and one in the school. I will go further than that and say that unless these powers are handed over to the Ministry of Health for medical inspection there will be two medical officers in the home and in the school, acting under different authorities, one under the Ministry of Health and the other under the Board of Education. In many cases, I believe, in England, but I am certain in Scotland, the children under five are under the Board of Education, but under this Bill they are to be treated medically under the Ministry of Health. In case of infectious disease they will be treated under this Bill. The medical officer deals with children under five in case of infectious disease, but another medical officer under the Ministry of Education comes in and deals with children between five and fourteen. It seems to me that you can make
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
as many difficulties as you wish, but I appeal to the President of the Local Government Board and also to the President of the Board of Education not to make difficulties, but to fall in with the views expressed by so many hon. Members of the Committee, which I firmly believe represents the views of the country on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain BARNETT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going to support this Amendment. At first sight it seems rather remarkable that we should be taking powers from the Minister of Education, who does not wish to give them up, and handing them over to the Minister of Health, who does not want them, but I feel, after hearing the arguments, that the proper course is to support the Amendment. The hon. Member for London University (Sir P. Magnus) asked if you are going to have a Ministry of Health at all, why should not these powers be transferred, and the hon. and gallant Member for East Newcastle (Major Barnes) said that there was a great question of principle behind it. I agree that there is. It is a question whether we in the House of Commons are going to decide these matters or appoint Ministers to decide them afterwards for us. When the Minister for Education made his second speech, the only help he gave us was a suggestion that something should be done by an Order in Council, but we do not want any more Orders in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are bound to say on this Amendment that it would be far better for us to be told now by the Minister responsible whether these powers and duties ought to be transferred or not. Let us decide that question. We do not want to set up a super-man. I do not doubt that the President of the Local Government Board is a super-man, but we do not want him to decide for us. Let the Minister in charge of the Bill first consider these questions, and then submit them to the House of Commons. Do not let us be asked here to set up a Ministry with very wide powers and then leave the Minister to decide things afterwards. This is what might be called half-baked legislation, for it is bringing Bills forward in which important things have not been decided, and practically it amounts to an abdication of the rights of this House. For these reasons I shall support the Amendment if we go to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and gallant Member who has just spoken has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
not given those of us who have worked on this subject so long credit for our good intentions. We do not want to put before Parliament a sham, and I assure the Committee that the reason for this proposal in its present form is because we want to make a businesslike and practical proposal. I rather regret that some of the speakers have not really addressed themselves to helping us to solve the difficulty which lies behind the words "or any," because that discussion has shown quite clearly, as was pointed out by the hon. Member for Merthyr (Sir Edgar Jones) that it is very difficult to disentangle these administrative matters, and it really is a mistake to take an are and chop the whole thing right up without considering administrative convenience and what is practical with one authority and put it on to another. That is the reason for putting these things in the second category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious, however, that the general feeling of the Committee is strongly in favour of the principles of the hon. Member's Amendment, and neither my right hon. Friend nor myself under these circumstances want to resist it. There is nothing in it which is out of accord with the general conception of the Bill, in fact, it is quite in accord with it. I would like to say at once that if this Amendment were carried I think the Committee will clearly understand that so far as I am competent to say what is practical in this matter, and I have given most minute attention to it for a long time, that it would not be practical, if the Amendment were carried in its present form, for the Minister of Health to set up a scheme for the general extension of our health services in the country so sorely needed in many directions to-day, and at the same time to take over rapidly all those other powers, duties and responsibilities. The Minister would have to do all this in stages. That is why the words are in the Bill. Therefore, I suggest that the proposal which my right hon. Friend has made, although it did not seem to be very well received, does meet the Committee in principle, and at the same time leaves it in an administrative practical shape. I am advised by the draughtsman that the words "or any" could not appear in this Section if it became paragraph (	<i>f</i>) of Clause 2. It would not be possible to have them in there, because you must state specifically what it is you are transferring. I think the general sense of the Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
is that whilst this service must be transferred to the Minister of Health, at the same time the door ought to be left open to the Departments or to the Minister to arrange that certain of these functions which clearly belong to the educational side and not to the health side can be discharged by the educational Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should like to know what are the functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Debate has clearly indicated what they are. I therefore think that the suggestion of my right hon. Friend really does meet the Committee. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] Subject to any exceptions which may be made by Order in Council. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] It is quite clear that unless you are going to have in the Bill a long category of a very great variety of powers you must have some method of specifying them hereafter. We shall see them much more clearly when we come to one of the later Amendments. I therefore think that the proposal of my hon. Friend is the practical way of meeting the difficulty. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] Of course, if his suggestion is not acceptable to the Committee, it does not stand in the way of my right hon. Friend's Amendment, which is the one really before it. All I can say is that if the Amendment is carried it must be open to us to review the situation, and, if we really find it vitally necessary for administrative purposes in the working of the services in the educational department, to bring up words on Report which will meet the administrative difficulties which I am sure the carrying of the Amendment in its present form will certainly make for us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman looks at Sub-section (3) of Clause 3 he will see—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be lawful for His Majesty, from time to time, to transfer from the Minister to any other Government Department, any of the powers and duties that he is now taking over."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, if it should happen that under this Amendment he takes over any powers that he does not think properly belongs to him, but more properly to the Board of Education, he can re-transfer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CAIRNS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a stranger in the Committee, and as the representative of a mining constituency and a district where the schools are closed every now and again and where we have sometimes seven and eight people living in one home, I would like to say that we are prepared

	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
to accept the Amendment of the hon. Member with unanimity. I look upon this Bill as the Magna Charta in medicine and surgery of the class to which I belong. We want one head. "A house divided against itself cannot stand." "Too many cooks spoil the broth." "What is everybody's business is nobody's business." I have great respect for the Minister of Education and give him every credit for what he has done elsewhere. No doubt he has come here with the best intentions, but in the language of the Minister yesterday on introducing the Bill of Ways and Communications, we want unification. My impression of Acts of Parliament is that they have been too much confused. You never know what belongs to this Department and what to that Department. The Minister himself has been complaining that the ship may be overladen, but we can take some of the work from the Ministry and make it a pure Department of Health. I do not want to speak of the complaints that we have had in our colliery districts, but our population has been decimated many a time through lack of medical and surgical advice. Sometimes people have had to go miles and miles. There is plenty of money in the country; it is the richest country in the world. Why cannot we therefore set up a Department to go into medicine and surgery? The best thing in the country is the health of the child. If the children are not healthy you can build what house you like and it will not mend matters. I would like to see research into the causes of diseases. There are any number of unseen causes yet. Our people are now dying three and four in a house for want of medical advice and attention. I therefore support the hon. Member opposite with all the power that I have and I speak for labour. We ought to have the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This paragraph of the Sub-section is one which deals with the transfer to the Ministry of Health of the powers vested in the Privy Council over midwives. The present position is that the Privy Council have power over the education, regulation and discipline of midwives. The actual administration of the midwives service is in the hands of the local authorities and the borough and county councils. I move this Amendment mainly for the purpose of ascertaining the opinion of the Government in some matters. The mid-wives are a branch of the medical service, and as the Bill stands it is proposed to take them over, but the Ministry of Health does not propose to take charge of other branches of the medical service. The British Medical Association, the Pharmaceutical Society and other branches of the service are left intact. I do not appreciate the reason why one branch is taken over and other branches are not. The British Medical Association and other bodies are called into counsel when questions of discipline arise and rules and regulations have to be enforced against midwives, and there may be divided authority if the powers of the Privy Council are transferred to the Ministry of Health, while it has not the same relations with the British Medical Association. The midwives were placed by the deliberate intention of Parliament under the Privy Council and not under the Local Government Board for the express purpose that their training, regulation and discipline should not be a matter of local influence, and they should be removed as far as possible from that. The intention was that the training should be quite distinct from the administration of the midwifery service by the local authorities. I should like to ask the representative of
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
the Government to give the reason why they are proposing the transfer of this service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of my right hon. Friend the President of the Local Government Board I think I should at once explain why we have drawn up the Bill in this manner. The local authorities, as the hon. and gallant Gentleman has just said, were given certain powers, and other powers were given to the Privy Council. The Act of 1902 imposed a certain amount of duties upon the local authorities in connection with midwives, and that was extended and emphasised by the Act which was passed last year. I am sure my hon. and gallant Friend, who has taken an interest in all these questions of administration, will realise that the Ministry of Health, in succeeding the Local Government Board in these matters, will be a more fit and qualified body to deal with them than the Privy Council. The local authorities have certain duties laid upon them, and they have to refer to the Local Government Board in many matters regarding the midwives, and it would facilitate the working of the present system if the transfer were made. With regard to the judicial functions there is now an appeal to the High Court of Justice, and we do not propose to interfere with that. There will still be the same right of appeal to that Court and not to the Minister of Health. We do not propose to interfere with the Midwives Board, but we shall allow it to go on as before. I think that the Committee this morning showed that it wanted, as far as possible, to take all these matters dealing with infants and children under the Ministry of Health, and I think, also, it would be unwise to remove from this Department a matter so closely associated with infant welfare.

	<br><blockquote><p>"all the duties of the Registrar-General."</p></blockquote>
In moving my Amendment I do not in any way do so because I think either the Registrar-General or his Department have not most efficiently carried on their work in the past, but I do say that I wish to see concentrated under the Ministry of Health all the services that are primarily health services. The duties of the Registrar-General, as far as I understand them, are threefold. In the first place, there is the duty of the registration of births, deaths and marriages; secondly, there is the duty of the collation of the statistics in the Statistical Department; and thirdly, there is the preparation of the Census. I think if those duties are analysed, whilst no doubt certain of them are not primarily health services, the greater part of them are, and that so much is that realised by the Registrar-General and his Department that I think I am right in saying the statistical officer of the Board of Trade is always a medical officer. The present statistical officer is, I believe, a gentleman who served as medical officer under the London County Council, and also under one of the other local authorities, and the fact that it is necessary the statistical officer should be a medical officer makes me think that the duties of the Registrar-General are pre-eminently duties connected with the health service. The Local Government Board itself has, I believe, its Statistical Department, dealing with statistics of infectious diseases, and it seems to me that a duplication of duties will leave the Registrar-General possibly with his Statistical Department, and another Department dealing with births and deaths statistics, which are vital to the administration of the Health Department. There is the further question of departmental administration. At the present time the office of the Registrar-General is one of those small independent offices which in my view are difficult to administer. There are difficulties of promotion, difficulties of staff: in a small office these things are much more difficult to control than in a big office, and it is better that these small organisations should be brought. within
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
the bigger organisation of the Ministry of Health, not only from the point of view of the statistics of the Ministry of Health, but also from the point of view of administration. I fully realise that some of the duties of the Registrar-General are primarily concerned with the Ministry of Health, but at the same time the greater part of those duties are directly connected with the Ministry of Health, and consequently the decision of the Committee arrived at this morning, in accordance with the principles of Lord Haldane's Reconstruction Committee, should be followed with regard to the relations between the various offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"all the powers and duties of the Local Government Board."</p></blockquote>
The Registrar-General is now subject to the Local Government Board, and therefore that Clause would include the transfer of his powers and duties. If there are any which do not relate to health, and which we find we ought not to have, they can by a subsequent Clause be transferred to some other Department. I think that all my hon. and gallant Friend requires is covered by the Bill as drafted, and it is not necessary to deal with the matter as suggested by the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Education, but it differs in two particulars. The Amendment refers only to certain classes of persons, a large class and a very important class, whereas in dealing with the medical duties of the Board of Education we were practically referring to nearly the whole community, to all the children who would grow up into men and women. Again, this Amendment differs from the other in that I cannot find any reference to the Home Office in the Bill. There is no suggestion in the Bill that certain duties of the Medical Department of the Home Office shall be at once transferred to the Ministry of Health, and that certain other duties shall be later on transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; in Clause 3 (1, 	<i>e</i>), and 3 (2, 	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS.</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> That is so. I see there are certain powers which relate to infant protection; it is the duties which will be discharged under the Children Act, which appear to have been exercised by the Home Office. I am proposing that further duties under the Home Office shall be taken over by the Ministry of Health. My Amendment refers particularly to the sanitary condition of factories and the investigation and prevention of industrial diseases. I need scarcely point out that there are many diseases which are incidental to factory work, and the investigation of some of these diseases might, of course, be undertaken by the Medical Research Committee, which Committee, I hope, will be under the direction of the Ministry of Health; but it would seem desirable that such diseases, which are at present considered and investigated by the Medical Department of the Home Office, should in future be considered and investigated under the Ministry of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, again, there are connected with the Home Office many duties of a sanitary character, such as looking after ventilation, seeing that no injury is likely to be effected by the disposition and equipment of the plant and machinery, and many other matters of that kind which are at present looked into by the inspectors and by the factory certifying surgeons. It may be necessary that some of these duties should be retained by the Home Office. I put a question in the House not very long ago in which I asked for in formation in regard to the medical services undertaken by the Home Office, and the answer was that the present established staff, which numbers about
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
200, includes three medical inspectors, who supervise the work of the factory, some who are certifying surgeons, and there are also three women temporary inspectors with special hospital training. I shall be very glad if the Minister in charge can indicate to me what are the present duties of the 200 members of the staff who, I understand, are attached to the medical side of the Factory Department. The answer given in the House itself was not clear upon that point, and the question of the importance of this Amendment depends very much upon the answer that may be given by the Minister in charge as to the special duties and functions of these 200 members of the established staff. That is a point which I have not been able so far to discover, and I would be very glad indeed if the Minister could give some answer to that question. Meanwhile, in order to obtain that information and in view of indicating the desirability of transferring those duties to which I have referred to the Ministry of Health as coming more immediately under their direction than under that of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Lord H. CAVENDISH-BENTINCK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say a word or two in support of the Amendment that has been moved by my right hon. Friend? Personally, I would go further than he has done, and transfer the whole of the Home Office factory inspection to the Health Ministry. It seems to me that everything said this morning applies with much greater force now. The greater part or a very large proportion of the lives of the workers in this country is spent in daytime in the factory. The object of this Bill is to set up a central controlling authority, and the Health Minister cannot very well evade the responsibility of taking over these duties. If it is of importance that he should have the supervision of the health of the children, it is equally important that he should have the supervision of the health, for instance, of the adolescent worker. The health of the adolescent workers in our factories and workshops is very largely neglected at the present moment, and all we have given them is to submit them to a very perfunctory examination by the certifying surgeon. After that nobody takes any notice at all. The only care that is taken of them is by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
factory inspector, and the pre-war average of visits by a factory inspector was twice in three years. It is not too much to say that the State almost entirely neglects the health of the adolescent workers, who are at a period of life when they are most impressionable by adverse influence. As a matter of fact, we know nothing about the health of the adolescent worker. All we know is that in future life we have an enormous number of people asking for admission to our hospitals. I do not want to say anything derogatory of the Home Office; but one cannot read the Health of the Munition Workers Report without seeing that they have grievously failed in their duties. Nobody has greater admiration than I have for the devoted character of the work which the staff of the Home Office puts in. They have been most ridiculously understaffed, particularly with regard to the subject of health research. May I, with the permission of the Committee read a few sentences from the Health of the Munition Workers Report? First of all, it draws attention to the enormous revolution that has taken place in industry by the fact that a large number of female adolescent workers have come into industry. Then say that this is
	<br><blockquote><p>"an unexplored region of science and labour."</p></blockquote>
Then they go on to say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Then, as to the injurious effect of industry upon women and young persons, reliable data may be said to have been almost wholly lacking, as they are equally lacking in respect of the relation of fatigue to disease."</p></blockquote>
Again, the proper length and distribution of hours of labour—spells, pauses, overtime—in relation to output is another problem which has never yet been scientifically explored. The Committee here also found themselves without data. Once more, though attention is now being given to so-called scientific management, evidence is still wanting to show how far the speed of working can be increased or the method modified without involving an undue physical or mental strain on the worker, which counterbalances or even destroys the advantages claimed. In the absence of reliable data on these and other problems of industrial organisation the difficulties in the way of a wise handling of the special problems arising out of the War have been greatly increased. The Committee mentioned these points with a view to laying emphasis upon the imperative need of a more accurate understanding and a firmer and more comprehensive grasp of the whole problem of health and
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
physique in relation to industry. In the Committee's view it is necessary to "make arrangements, without delay, for a national scheme for medical research, and to accord fuller recognition to the importance of industrial hygiene."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am hoping that as the country gets covered with Whitley councils and workshop committees and committees of workmen and employers, the police of the Home Office may really become superfluous, and that the observance of the Regulations under the Factory Acts will be a matter of self-regulation. That being so, it becomes important that our factory inspectors in future should not serve the duties of policemen or spies, but should be expert advisers on matters of sanitation, health, and hygiene. That being so, I submit it is obviously the duty of the Health Ministry to have the appointment and control of the factory inspector, inasmuch, as I said before, he will become a health expert and adviser on these kinds of matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. BRAMSDON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point which occurs to me in connection with this matter that I think it is advisable to mention to the Committee, and that is that it seems to me that the inspection of factories and workshops is altogether wrong in being connected with the Home Office. It seems to me that it should be transferred to the Minister of Labour, and that it is a very material question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee will have a great deal of sympathy with this Amendment. At first sight it seems to be on the same plane as the one we have just passed, but my own view is that we should not be doing the wisest thing if at this moment we took the Factory Acts out of the hands of the Home Office and transferred them 	<i>en bloc</i> to the Ministry of Health. I will give my reasons for this. First of all, at starting. I quite agree with my hon. Friend who just spoke. The factory service is becoming more and more a medical service; the chief inspector of factories is now a medical man, and as science advances and as knowledge grows, the work of factory inspectors is more and more becoming health and medical work. But still there are interests in the Factory Acts which are not medical, and interests that I ask the Committee to consider. It is a great service, and it is centralised here in London. If it were transferred to the Minister of Health he would at once have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
to start work with which, with all his skill and ability, he is not acquainted. I think my hon. Friend was a little unfair to the Home Office. He said the Health of Munition Workers' Committee had shown to be inefficient on some of the work of the Home Office. But he has overlooked two facts—the first fact, that in war time hundreds of thousands of women were flocking to industry owing to the great pressure in the production of munitions of war, and the effort of the Home Office was totally unable to cope with the number. The second point is far more important—to increase production the Government wisely or unwisely, and, I think, very unwisely, relaxed the provisions of the Factory Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Home Office did that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government did that. It is not right to blame the Home Office for the evils which sprang from the relaxations during the crisis of war of the very measures intended to prevent those evils. I quite agree the whole question of industrial fatigue is largely an untrodden field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whose fault is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree that Sir George Newman has collected an enormous amount of valuable material, but I would ask my hon. Friend to bear in mind that medical science must be always advancing, and I do respectfully ask him to consider that every advance is not an aspersion and a blame on those who went before. We must advance, and I quite agree that report of Sir George Newman's Committee is an advance. But the matter does not rest there. All the good work of the Health of Munition Workers' Committee is, I believe, now being carried on by the Industrial Fatigue Research Board, set up last year to take its place, and there is no reason why there should be a cessation of this excellent work. Would it be wise at the beginning of the new Ministry to cast this great burden on its shoulders? I feel it right to say from my experience that the work has been admirably done by the Home Office, and if reforms are to be made let those reforms be made, but do not now go and take this great service from the Home Office and cast it on to a Minister who, I think, will have quite sufficient to look after without it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. GRIFFITHS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say that so far as my experience is concerned in reference to the Home Office, Dr. Ethel Collis has done very excellent work in so far as the industrial workers of the country are concerned. My experience has been that when the Home Office want to make an investigation about anything that may arise in some industry the biggest opposition comes from the employers and not from the Home Office. This morning you have been dealing with the question of the work to be performed by local authorities in so far as the Health Bill is concerned. This is a question concerning the industrial workers of the country, and I want to know from the President of the Local Government Board whether the work of looking after the health of industrial workers could not be better done by the Labour Ministry than the Ministry of Health. We have been informed by the Insurance Committees in the country that the question of looking after the soldiers has been handed over to the Ministry of Labour, and the question is whether we are not going to overload the ship by taking work from the Home Office and placing it on the Ministry of Health. Perhaps the President of the Local Government Board will give us an explanation on these points. It is one of the most important points we are discussing to-day. We must look after the industrial health of the workers. If you get broken down men and women you are going to get deteriorated children. We ought to begin here as well as beginning with the children. I do not wish to see the ship overloaded just at the beginning, and I should like some assurance from the right hon. Gentleman as to what is going to be done so far as the Labour Ministry is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will have been brought to mind that a very important group of considerations stand closely allied to this question—functions in this respect of the Ministry of Labour, as the Ministry of Labour will properly develop. I am sure the Noble Lord who supported the Amendment will at all events acquit me of any lack of zeal in using what opportunities I have had to improve industrial conditions. I was the person who set up the Munition Workers' Committee. We were working under novel conditions, introducing women into all kinds of foreign occupations, making, shall I say, all kinds of abominations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
of a very novel kind, and this Committee, I am sure, recognises most definitely the valuable work which has been done. It really is the duty of the Minister of Health to see that the research work of his own Department, and the research work he encourages elsewhere, continues, and that the most minute and detailed cognisance is taken of these conditions, because I agree that they are among the most vital matters in the prevention of sickness and disability generally. But that is entirely different from saying that you should transfer to the Ministry of Health all this additional work at the very beginning. All that it involves has not been as yet fully recognised. We discussed this matter with very great care before we omitted it from the Bill. It was not omitted because of Departmental obstruction. It was omitted because in my view, and in the view of others, the proper home for the consideration of industrial conditions is the Ministry of Employment as it will ultimately develop. At the present time all these duties are in the Home Office and other Departments of a similar kind. You will see how inappropriate it would be therefore to transfer these duties and the administration of the Factory Acts to the Ministry of Health. Those 200 inspectors to whom the hon. Member for London University referred are engaged in the various branches dealing with the administration of the Factory Acts—hours and conditions of working, in loading and unloading ships, docks duties, locomotives, generation of electricity, and various other things connected with trade processes. Then we have, again, a group of inspectors for accidents, sanitation, drainage, lavatories, etc., in the manufactories, and still a further group for the administration of the Factory Acts in other detail. I think myself that the proper sphere for the Ministry of Health is to encourage research and provide standards, but not to hand on to them the administration of something which in the main is essentially labour and industrial; otherwise you will have the Minister of that Department involved in a bog of controversy about hours and conditions which, after all, are inseparable from administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the right hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the hon. Member for the University of London that my complaint is that you would have to deal, among many other things, with the quarries, with the mines, with the Truck Acts, with the Workmen's Compensation Acts, with the Police Acts, and divide them all into little bits before you could get them out? As a matter of fact, it would mean the dissection of a dozen Acts of Parliament at least. What is the proper sphere of the Ministry of Health? I think the general responsibility for the observation of industrial standards and conditions of employment, and all they involve, should be the responsibility of the people who have to deal with industrial questions, and we do not want to confuse the issue by saddling it on to the Ministry of Health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has been said by the President of the Local Government Board will, I feel sure, be received with great satisfaction by all the local authorities. The Public Health Department will largely be the Department supervising and overlooking the things which have to be done locally. Up to now—if I may say so without profanity—thank Heaven that the inspection of factories, which has been done by the Home Office, may in future be done by the Ministry of Labour ! If you put that class of work on to the Ministry of Health it will naturally mean only more and difficult work on the local authorities, who are not in most cases qualified to deal with it, or upon the Ministry of Health, an entirely new kind of institution, which is inconsistent with the action contemplated by this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P.

I quite realise that the ordinary duties of the factory inspector should not be transferred to the Ministry of Health, but I gather from what the President of the Local Government Board said that the questions relating to the investigation or prevention of industrial diseases, which are very complicated and involve questions of a highly scientific nature, can only really be satisfactorily considered by men with an intimate knowledge of research, and that those matters will still be under the direction of the Minister of Health. If that is so, I will,

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. CHEYNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (1, 	<i>e</i>), to add the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>f</i>) all or any of the powers and duties of the Minister of Pensions with respect to the health of disabled officers and men after they have left the service;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>g</i>) any other powers and duties in England and Wales of any Government Department which appear to His Majesty to relate to matters affecting or incidental to the health of the people."</p></blockquote>
The object of my Amendment is to make certain that these things will be taken up at some time or other, and not left to a stage when it might be necessary to ask for an Order in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of these subjects have been dealt with. The question of factory legislation has just been discussed, and as regards (	<i>f</i>) there is the provision that it shall not be taken until a year after the end of the War. That is practically a promise to take it over. But I formally move the words referring to the powers and duties of the Minister of Pensions. There is also paragraph (	<i>g</i>), relating to any other powers and duties in England and Wales of any Government Department which appear to His Majesty to relate to matters affecting or incidental to the health of the people, and I am willing to move that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be better if the words relating to the powers and duties of the Minister of Pensions should be moved first separately. And if necessary the other words could be taken afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will deal first with the words relating to "all or any of the powers or duties of the Minister of Pensions with respect to the health of disabled officers and men after they have left the Service."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel WEIGALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to thank the Chairman for allowing this Amendment to be moved in order that the Minister present may give us the benefit of his views on the question of the pensions service and its administration. I was in favour of the decision with regard to the education services, as a distinct body, which was arrived at by the Committee because I look upon it as affecting the whole of the life of a section of the nation. But in this case of the Ministry of Pensions it is an 	<i>ad hoc</i> body. You have the medical service which has to deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
treatment, and you have the question of the terms of the pension. The whole system of the Pensions Department depends on the assessment of the Medical Board, and it will be difficult to take over now the administration of the treatment of disabled officers and men. You must continue to have an 	<i>ad hoc</i> Government Department for this purpose. There are, however, many duties that can be undertaken by arrangement between the Pensions Department and the Ministry of Health as things develop, such as the treatment of tuberculosis and the arrangements for disabled men. I feel sure that the soldiers would prefer to remain for some time at least under the Ministry of Pensions, but it may be possible to make these joint arrangements with regard to tuberculosis and other diseases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. HARRIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Amendment as it stands is quite explicit enough. It does not make it clear what are the powers that we are to transfer, whether any or only some of them. This proposal is too sweeping. The question of pensions is very much mixed up with the question of the health of the disabled men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disabled man has to know the terms of his pension, and how far he is entitled to draw it, as well as to get medical treatment. There are other questions with regard to health which fall into the province of the Pensions Minister. I do not think it is desirable to transfer the pensions work to the Ministry of Health, unless we know what is to be the position of the local war pensions committees, who are doing so much active work among the men. They are visiting the disabled men to see that they go under treatment, and indeed to urge them to go under treatment. And that is very important work. They are not willing to flock to a Minister, or to his office, to get treatment. Is that good local work going to be interfered with? The transfer of the pensions work to the Ministry of Health would affect both training and treatment as well as the pensions. I understand that they are going to set up a machinery for the training and treatment of the men, and I think it should be in the hands at present of the Pensions Minister. If the Amendment were to be pressed it should be set out in a definite Clause, so that we would know exactly what was intended to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what has just fallen from the hon. Member.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
The taking over of all these services at once is not really within the scope and scheme of the Bill. This pensions service is to a large extent temporary and special, and now that the War is over the pensions work on the medical side is decreasing, and the number of men will get fewer every month. Until we get to a later stage it will be inadvisable to interfere with the pensions work, or with the central or local administration in order to separate the health work. But when you have got to the point when the number of men to be dealt with is ascertained and the treatment to be given has been to a large extent standardised, then it will be desirable that the work of the Pensions Minister should be transferred to the Minister of Health. If we were to give effect to this Amendment we should obviously be putting the disabled man under a new and temporary machinery, whereas the Ministry of Health is intended to unify these various Departments. It would leave the subsequent changes to be made from time to time by Order in Council, and that is scarcely a constitutional method. We want to do these things in a definite form and at a definite time with the consent of Parliament. If the Government said that in two or three or four years these duties would be taken over by the Ministry of Health, then we should have something more definite, and we might make an approach to that unification of the medical services which we all desire. I suggest that if this is to be done at all, a definite time limit should be fixed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the definite suggestion put forward by the hon. Gentleman who has just sat down, I think he will find that its proper place is in Clause 11. I am prepared to say now that we are prepared to put down some time limit. That was our intention, and we have already done so in putting in the words not less than a year after the War, so as to give a definite date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we want fixed is a time limit not later than a definite date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the point; that the transfer shall not take effect within twelve months after the termination of the War, and there is abundant justification in this discussion for that provision. My right hon. Friend's intention was to look at the problem as it appeared twelve months' hence. At the
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
present time you cannot disentangle the medical staff from the pensions staff. There remain many questions of medical treatment in connection with pensions, and they have first-hand experience of it. We cannot now say exactly how big the power is going to be. I hope it will get less daily and be more easily disentangled, but we are now at a temporary and provisional stage which depends upon the treatment as well as the conditions of the pensions. It would be almost a disaster if we were at present to enter into a new problem. It is for that reason that the time limit has been placed in the Bill, but I appreciate this suggestion that the Minister of Health and the Minister of Pensions should undertake to do what they can in the meantime. We have not waited to be urged by this Committee. We have already started to set up joint arrangements to secure more adequate treatment, which is very much needed, and we are doing everything we can to help the work of the local authorities. We have given evidence that we realise we have to work towards this end, but it will require time, and I hope therefore that the Amendment which has been moved will not be persisted in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is very indefinite and I hope it will not be persisted in by the hon. Gentleman. This morning the Committee gave us marching orders with regard to the treatment of school children, and we will do our best to act in accordance with their instructions; but this, I submit, is an instruction which is almost as wide as the world and impossible to carry out. I think, subject to what my hon. and learned Friend may say with regard to Orders in Council, all that is really necessary are the words "Any other powers and duties in England and Wales," and so on, which will really cover all the hon.

Ministry of Health will in any way induce him not to place any obstacle in the way of considering this omnibus Clause in the House; because, as the right hon. Gentleman himself has said, it is as wide as the world, and I hope he will not take a decision come to with regard to factories and workshops as applying to the whole. I think that bound up in this enormous question of human relationships, labour, and capital, and so forth, one of the greatest agencies we can have in solving this problem is the application of science in order to decide the various matters which have to be decided—what the hours should be, what the quality of meals, and so forth should be, and the whole variety of things which make up public life. Science is the servant of both master and man, and unless there is some Department to take up the question of what is to be done nothing will be done. For instance, there are lots of children under sixteen years of age employed, and though they are out of the control of the Board of Education as a medical authority, and will be out of the control of the Ministry of Health as an authority, they are practically under no care as regards medical attendance, and I want to be assured that the discussion we have had will not prejudice the possibility of this question being fully considered under this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend stated, "I think I can meet my hon. Friend by saying
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
I adopt the suggestion," for all we desired was that there should be included in the Ministry of Health a Research Department, and that Research Department can be instituted under the words it is proposed to insert. We could not possibly have any objection to a separate Research Department under the direction of the Privy Council. Consequently, having regard to what has already been proposed, I am perfectly prepared to withdraw this Amendment, and to leave in the Bill the provision that the Medical Research Committee which was under the direction of the Insurance Commissioners should be transferred to the Privy Council and be a separate Department under their direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (1), to insert the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(iii) Unless Parliament in any Act for the vevision of the law relating to the relief of the poor shall otherwise determine, on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, or such earlier date as may be fixed by His Majesty in Council, the powers and duties under the enactments relating to the relief of the poor by this Act transferred to the Minister, except such as His Majesty may by Order in Council declare to relate to or to be incidental to the health of the people, shall cease to be exercised by the Minister and shall be vested in such other Government Department as His Majesty may by Order in Council prescribe."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subsection (2), after the word "Minister" ["transfer to the Minister"], to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) all or any of the powers and duties of the Board of Education with respect to mentally defective and physically defective children."</p></blockquote>
Here the Committee will observe that we have passed beyond the services which are definitely transferred to the Ministry, and we now come to the powers which His Majesty can transfer by Order in Council. The first of those I suggest should be the one which relates to the duties of the Board of Education with respect to mentally defective and physically defective children. I admit at once that these two classes of children are on the border-line where health and education meet, and it is perfectly possible to take quite conflicting views as to who should be the deciding authority. Some Members may think the Board of Education ought to have charge of these children, while to others it may seem that they are mainly health cases and ought to be under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
Health Ministry. I submit on the whole, with regard to both classes, that they are pathological and not educational cases. In the case of mentally defective children I think the Committee will agree that the pathological element dominates, for though a child is educated and a certain number of these children are returned to the normal population, a vast number are not, and at sixteen years old those children are handed back to the care of the Board for mentally defectives. Until that time I submit to the Committee that such a child is really a medical case. It is educated for two reasons—first, on the chance of education improving its mental condition, and, secondly, for the reason of occupying its mind, so that it shall not get worse by neglect. Still I feel strongly that all through that child's career it is not a case of education, and that education really plays a very small part, because the large majority of these children are in fact not capable of being educated. When you come to the physically defective child a different state of things prevails. I agree the balance cannot be struck in quite the same place, but in the case of the physically defective child also the balance inclines to the medical side. I would remind the Committee that in the Act passed last Session a Section was very wisely inserted which made it incumbent on the education authorities to build schools for physically defective children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question the Committee have to decide in regard to these schools is whether these children are mainly medical cases or cases of children who can be returned to the normal population. As I said before there is very ample room for difference of opinion on this. But I think as time goes on and as medical science increases, the area of medical effort will become larger and the educational area will diminish. I therefore submit to the Committee that these are services which we might take power to transfer to the Ministry of Health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to support this Amendment. When this matter was discussed last week by the Parliamentary Committee of the County Council Association, this particular point was raised and pressed by some of the most experienced educationists in the country. The feeling was that if a child so afflicted is looked after, and then when it is 16 is sent back, in practice the educational authorities in nearly every case are un-
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
able, speaking vulgarly, to make a good job of it. It is primarily a pathological and not an educational case. We would really ask, in the interests of these children, that the Department to be responsible for them should be the Department of Public Health. Members of the Committee are well aware that there are in some parts of the country special schools for these children. All kinds of arrangements are possible between the Ministry of Health and local educational authorities, and there may be many cases where children may be without injury brought into ordinary schools. If so, ordinary educational authorities would welcome the opportunity. There is one class of human beings who commands the sympathy of all, and it is these unfortunate children. What we feel is that the primary responsibility for them should be with the Ministry of Health, because primarily their health is concerned, and it is only in so far as that is concerned that they come within the ambit of educational training and experiment. I respectfully submit this to the Committee, and I hope that the opinion that has been come to from experience by those who have tried to help these children may not be lightly regarded. I hope my right hon. Friends the President of the Local Government Board and the President of the Board of Education will, in substance, be able to support the Amendment, being well assured that both the Board and the local authorities will be just as willing as ever to help where they can; only we want to put the primary responsibility where it ought to lie, namely, on the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Amendment, and to ask, supposing there is a failure to deal with these children, on whom does the burden fall? Surely the burden of failure to deal satisfactorily with these children will fall on the local authority, which is the local health body. The question of estimates always comes in, and they may possibly have to sacrifice the defective schools before they see the proposition that they cannot get much return from the purely educational side in regard to these unfortunate children. I think the result would be that afterwards the rates would be less. Therefore I suggest that it is more in the interests of the local committee to spend money on this side rather than to spend money on the educational side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRIANT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the greatest problems we have to face is the treatment of not only those who are actually notifiable as insane, but this very large class of mentally defectives. I am anxious that under the same Ministry should be placed all the various classes of these downwards to the absolutely insane and to those mentally deficient. Those who have to face the many problems with regard to the defectives will know the very serious social consequences resultant on having these defective children at large. The whole problem has to be re-thought out, and I am extremely anxious that the Ministry of Health should have those who are in any way affected by this problem entirely under their purview. Otherwise, I think we shall be dealing only partially and therefore unwisely with the whole problem. The important feature in the case of these children is how to occupy their time and to preserve them from the danger of the world outside, which is very often the cause of very serious social problems at a later age. I am therefore anxious that the Ministry of Health should have all the classes under its charge and purview.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FISHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee this morning accepted an Amendment which placed under the new Minister of Health all or any of the powers and duties of the Board of Education with respect to the medical treatment of children and young persons. Consequently under this Amendment the Ministry of Health will have the power of medical inspection and treatment of all children and young persons who are mentally or physically defective. The question, therefore, which I wish to put to the Committee at this moment is whether this power does not go sufficiently far. Does the Committee desire that any further powers and duties at present exercised by the Board of Education in respect to this particular class should be transferred to the Ministry of Health? That is the only question before the Committee. My right hon. Friend and I are not in any way desirous of adopting a 	<i>non-possumus</i> attitude on this question. It obviously is a slightly difficult and delicate question to decide as to where the frontiers of education end and where the frontiers of health begin. The other day I was in one of these schools. I went into a class-room filled with little crippled girls, and they were all receiving exactly the type of education which is given to girls not so disabled in the public elementary schools.
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
I then went into the woodwork department of this school for defectives. I saw there a number of crippled boys doing the same type of woodwork as is done in the ordinary elementary school and trained by a master who had received the same type of education as a man who gave woodwork instruction in an ordinary elementary school. Then, again, if one goes into a school for the teaching of the deaf and dumb, one sees that the art of teaching the deaf and dumb has improved enormously of late. It is now really a most beautiful process and it requires teachers of very high quality and very high acquisitions to carry it out properly. There you find a most beautiful educational process going on in the class room. Then again, take the mentally defective. You go into a class room filled with mentally defectives and you will find they are given the same sort of physical exercise as that which is given in the elementary school. You will find that the teacher in a mentally defective school has to be specially trained in that he has to have, super-added to the qualifications of the teacher in the elementary school, qualifications that he receives by reason of attending special courses. There is therefore a great deal of real education carried on in the school. I submit that the Committee ought not, without a little further consideration, to transfer all these strictly educational functions to the Ministry of Health. I would suggest, if the Committee think well, that my right hon. Friend and I should have further opportunities of conferring upon the question, and then we might perhaps produce words which would be suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that this Amendment goes a little too far. It proposes to transfer from the Board of Education all the powers and duties they at present possess with respect to mentally defective and physically defective children. I particularly want to refer to deaf children. Deaf children are not necessarily dumb. It is perhaps a little mistake to speak of children as deaf and dumb. They are unable to speak because from childhood they were unable to hear, otherwise they probably would have been able to speak. The education given to these children at the present moment is under the Board of Education, as the President has said, and it is extremely well done. I know several schools of that kind. I was president of one of the schools which, I think, first introduced your

	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
system into this country. But at any rate the instruction under the Board of Education is extremely well done. I do not exactly see how it would be possible to transfer that system of education or the control of that education to the Ministry of Health. I almost think, therefore, that the Amendment which we have already passed does include as much as is necessary with regard to the duties of the Board of Education as to mentally defective and physically defective children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the beginning of Sub-section (3), to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"All matters connected with public libraries and museums, other than those relating to the British Museum, and gymnasiums should be transferred to the Board of Education, and."</p></blockquote>
There is already power in the Bill to do what this Amendment proposes. That power is indicated in Sub-section (3) of the Clause to which I refer, and my only reason for proposing the insertion of this Amendment is so that the House of Commons may have the opportunity of indicating if they accept it, that it is desirable that these powers should be transferred to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
Board of Education. As the matter now stands it will be possible for the Ministry of Health to hand over these powers to any other Department, and I see no reason why the Committee should not express its own opinion as to the particular Department to which these powers should be transferred. I think it is very desirable that the public libraries generally throughout the country should be under the control of the Board of Education, and that the same should be arranged with regard to the museums. There is no doubt whatever that both libraries and museums are essentially instruments of education. I need scarcely speak about libraries, but museums may be made very important instruments of education if the parties who visit those museums are properly educated and things are properly explained. I really do not know that any better lesson can be given to children in our schools than by taking them under proper supervision into one of our museums. There is full opportunity for the Board of Education to indicate how that instruction should be given. As regards gymnasiums, that brings up the whole question of physical exercise—a very important question—to which the President referred this morning. Personally, I regard physical education as quite as important as intellectual education for children, and I think it extremely desirable that the physical education of our children should be placed under the direction of the Board of Education. What I take would happen with regard to these gymnasium exercises is that the Board of Education would appoint men competent to indicate the most healthy form of physical exercise that could be given. They would draw up regulations for gymnasiums. There is no reason why the Ministry of Health should not have these before them for approval, and it is in connection with the physical exercises that there would be inter-communication between the Board of Education and the Ministry of Health. I venture to move this Amendment, because I think it is proper that the Committee should indicate if they think it desirable, that it should not be left absolutely to the discretion of any Minister of Health that should succeed the present President of the Local Government Board to decide to what Department these should be trans-ferred. I believe they are now under the Local Government Board, but I think it

The President of the Local Government Board has intimated that he will accept a second Amendment of mine which is really consequent upon this one. In the original Bill last year there are exactly the same words down to the word "Act," but in this new Bill they have entered upon it by taking in general words.

This paragraph is unnecessary, out of place, and unprecedented. I venture to think that a more amateurish paragraph than this it is impossible to conceive. Parliament, when it comes to deal with the Poor Law, will do so as it thinks fit, and the insertion of a declaration like this cannot limit or fetter its discretion. We know that the powers and duties relating to the relief of the poor are being transferred from the Local Government Board to the Ministry of Health, because it is impossible at short notice to disentangle the medical services.

I believe there are a very large number of people who will attach the highest importance to a declaration of this kind, and I hope it will be accepted. You must remember it says substantially that in reforming the Poor Law you are to take care that the health services now under the Poor Law are dealt with as a part of the general health services of the country. That is a vitally important decision. It is more than that.
