	<div class='title'>—(Deportation of Former Enemy Aliens.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>(1) Every former enemy alien who is now in the United-Kingdom shall be deported forthwith unless he shall within one month after the passing of this Act make an application to the Secretary of State in the prescribed form to be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom, stating the special grounds on which such application is based, and unless the Secretary of State after due inquiry shall grant him a licence to remain.</p>
	<p>(2) The applicant shall advertise notice of his application in some paper circulating in the district in which he resides or in which, if he is interned, he was residing previously to his internment.</p>
	<p>(3) The Secretary of State may, not less than one calendar month after the date of such advertisement, if he is satisfied that there is no adverse report on the applicant by the military or by the police authorities, grant such licence, subject to such terms and conditions (if any) as he shall think fit, on any one or more of the following grounds, namely:—
	<ol>
	<li>That the applicant, although a former enemy alien, is in fact a member of a nation or a race hostile to the States recently at war with His Majesty and is well disposed to His Majesty and his Government;</li>
	<li>That the applicant is seventy years of age or upwards and has been at least fifteen years resident in the United Kingdom;</li>
	<li>That the applicant is suffering from serious illness or infirmity of a permanent nature;</li>
	<li>That the applicant has one or more sons who voluntarily enlisted and served in the British Navy or Army or the Navy or Army of one of the Allied Powers;</li>
	<li>That the applicant has lived for at least thirty-five years in this country and married a British-born wife;</li>
	<li>That the applicant, although her husband is a former enemy alien living abroad or deported, was at the time of her mariage a British subject or citizen of an Allied State.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(4) If the application for a licence is made on any ground other than one or more of those above specified, the Secretary of State either shall refuse the application or may, if he is satisfied that owing to the exceptional circumstances of the case deportation would involve serious hardship of a personal nature on the applicant, grant him a licence under this Section.</p>
	<p>(5) In granting a licence under this Section, the Secretary of State may include in the licence the wife of the applicant and any child or children of his under the age of eighteen.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>(6) A list of the persons to whom such licence is granted together with a statement of the special grounds on which it is granted and of the exceptional circumstances (if any) under which it is granted shall, as soon as may be after the granting of the licence, be published in the "Gazette."</p>
	<p>(7) Any licence so granted may be at any time revoked by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p>(8) If such licence is not granted or if, having been granted, it shall be revoked the Secretary of State shall make an Order (in this Act referred to as a Deportation Order) requiring the alien to leave the United Kingdom and thereafter to remain out of the United Kingdom for a period of seven years after the passing of this Act. The Secretary of State may, by a Deportation Order, require the alien to return to the country of which he is a subject or citizen.—[	<i>Sir J. Butcher</i>.]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOHN BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
Putting it in a few words, the object of the Clause is to make provision that all former enemy aliens should be deported from this country, subject to certain exemptions. I make provision for those exemptions in the Clause, and in doing so I was largely helped by the experience I had when I was a member for some months last year of the Advisory Committee which advised the Home Secretary of that day as to what enemy aliens should be exempted from internment. As I and other members on that Committee found, it was most desirable that we should have specific instructions from Parliament as to the classes of people we should exempt. For that reason it is desirable to embody these general directions for exemption in the Clause. As to the general policy of deporting these former enemy aliens, upon that I imagine that most Members of the House of Commons made statements in the course of the Election, statements which were of a fairly strong character. I should be glad to hear if anyone did not. I desire to insist most strongly upon the fact that in making those statements they were not following a line of policy inaugurated by themselves. They were giving effect in their Election pledges to the definite statements and pledges which had been given already by the Prime Minister and by other prominent members of the Government before the General Election. Probably those pledges are within the recollection of the Committee. Let me recall one or two of them. Speaking at the Queen's Hall before the Election, the Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Germans have abused our hospitality. They spied and they plotted. They have assisted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Germany in the forging of plans for the destruction of the country which has offered them hospitality and, if opportunity had offered them, they would have assisted in the execution of those plans, to the ruin of the land which had given them shelter. They have, therefore, forfeited any claim to remain."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will notice that that applies not merely to the Germans who were interned at the moment of the Armistice, but to all the Germans in this country. In order to emphasise the matter, there was an interruption by someone who wanted to know what the Prime Minister was going to do to get rid of these enemy aliens. His answer was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have repeatedly said that in my judgment these people, having abused our hospitality, must not get another opportunity of doing so."</p></blockquote>
That is not all. There was a pledge given by the present Lord Chancellor, then Attorney-General, and one of the prominent members of the then Government and of the present Government. He said in a speech before the Election:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I tell you here as a Minister and a member of the Coalition Government that it is the declared policy of that Government to send back to Germany every Boche in this country."</p></blockquote>
Could anything be more clear? Could anything be more decisive in its language? If the Home Secretary is, as I trust he is not, going to tell us that he is not going to give effect to this positive declaration of the Prime Minister and of the then Attorney-General, now Lord Chancellor, I venture humbly to suggest that he will have to ask the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor to resign or possibly to adopt some other course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that be the general policy laid down by the Government, I put it to the Committee, is there any conceivable reason which an ingenious Home Secretary could suggest why these definite pledges should not be embodied in the Bill? This Bill is brought forward for the express purpose of restricting aliens. Is it not the most proper, natural, and, indeed, essential thing that these definite pledges should be embodied in this Bill, which the ordinary man in the street—indeed, the ordinary commonsense Member of Parliament—will see is the only possible way in which these pledges can be redeemed? My right hon. Friend may say, "I prefer to legislate by Order in Council." We are sick of Orders in Council, absolutely dead sick. The country is dead sick of them too. In every possible shape and form Orders in Council
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
have been passed in scores and masses during the War, sometimes without Parliament knowing much about them. I grant that it was necessary during a great war. We had to take no risk. We had to legislate quickly and suddenly in order to provide against the terrible dangers with which we were confronted. It would have been impossible to pass these restrictions in the ordinary way by means of an Act of Parliament. Therefore we were all agreed and the country submitted with great patience to the innumerable restrictions imposed upon it during the War by Orders in Council, for this reason only, that it was necessary for our salvation. The War is over. Peace has been happily declared. If there is one result of that peace which is present to the mind of every man and woman in this country, the first thought, of course, is one of deep thankfulness to the men who fought for us and who won the War, the next thought, perhaps, is that we want to return to normal conditions of freedom and Parliamentary government, under which we shall have no more of these Orders in Council and no more of this; legislation without the express consideration of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why, in this particular matter, when we are carrying out a pledge of the Prime Minister, we should leave it to the discretion of the Home Secretary, however competent and however much we trust and admire him, and there is no reason why we should not embody it in an Act of Parliament. I grant that the Home Secretary said on the Second Reading of this Bill that there are some things which are of a temporary character which will have to be dealt with during the next year or two, and which will have to be dealt with by Orders in Council. Be it so. I make that admission frankly, but is there any conceivable reason why it should be left to the discretion of the Home Secretary? My right hon. Friend is here to-day. No doubt he is doing his best. I do not quite know what he is doing, but I have no doubt that he is doing his best. If he ceases to hold his office is it to be assumed that the next Home Secretary would not issue new Orders in Council? If this Government fell—of which there does not seem to be much appearance—a new Home Secretary might come into Office who would say, "I am not bound by these pledges. I shall issue Orders in Council allowing all Boches to remain." I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
say that is an imminent danger, but as a matter of principle that is the reason why those pledges should be embodied in legislation. The Home Secretary, in a passage in his speech on the Second Reading, admitted that his Bill would be required to be amended, and had he not given those pledges I believe the Bill would have been thrown out. Everyone who spoke pointed out the absurdity and the unconstitutional character in a time of peace of legislation by Order in Council. On the 15th April the Home Secretary said this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any hon. Member can suggest to us any particular direction in which our experience is sufficient to justify a provision being made permanent, as we propose to make permanent the provisions dealing with enemy aliens, who come to stir up unrest, it will be considered with the greatest care, and. if found feasible, will he adopted."</p></blockquote>
You have this extraordinary position that there is to be a permanent provision preventing enemy aliens from stirring up unrest. So far the right hon. Gentleman has not made provision for sending back to their own country and keeping out in future any enemy aliens. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have not absolutely excluded from this Bill all measures of a permanent character. We have only retained an existing power to proceed by Order in Council. If Amendments can be brought forward to show a direction in which the permanent provisions of the Act can be increased and extended, they will be carefully and sympathetically considered."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th April, 1919, col. 2748, Vol. 114.]</p></blockquote>
He gave that pledge and he got the Second Reading on the strength of that pledge, amongst others, and I am quite sure he will not go back upon it now. Let me say one word about the numbers we have to deal with. The Home Secretary can see the numbers in his speech on that occasion. At the date of the Armistice there were 24,000 Germans interned in this country. Between November, 1918, and April, 1919, some 19,000 of these Germans were sent home. That left about 5,000 Germans remaining interned here in April last. I should be interested to know how many of those 5,000 have been sent back since. That is not all, because in November, 1918, there were 21,000 enemy aliens in this country not interned. I should like to ask the Home Secretary how many of those have been sent home? Have any been sent home? The Home Secretary is silent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, a number of un-interned aliens have been sent home. Now and again we have consulted Mr. Justice Younger's Committee before sending them home, but we have sent a considerable number without consultation at all with anybody. I cannot give the figures at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to hear it. Probably the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give the figures of the enemy aliens uninterned at the date of the Armistice who have been sent back. The number uninterned at the date of the Armistice was 21,000. I shall be glad to know how many have been sent back since. That is the magnitude of the numbers with which we have to deal. I feel this is an intensely unimportant subject. Many people will say "Why were there so many as 21,000 enemy aliens uninterned at the date of the Armistice?" I am fortunately able to tell the Committee why that was. In 1915, under pressure from Parliament, the Home Secretary of that day began interning enemy aliens in this country. I will not go into the history of that matter, but anyone who was in the last Parliament will remember what a struggle there was to get the Home Secretary of the day stimulated into any kind of action. However, he was stimulated into action and began interning. Then he set up a Committee for the purpose of giving exemption to those whom he thought ought not to be interned. I was not on that Committee, but no one will deny that that Committee was exceedingly lenient. They created exemptions wholesale and left an enormous number of Germans uninterned, in some cases on the most trivial excuses. Why do I say that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1918, again under the pressure of Parliament, the Home Secretary said that he would have a further revision of these uninterned Germans and he set up again this Committee which formerly advised him in 1915 in order to revise the exemptions which they had granted in 1915. I sat on that Committee, which was presided over by Mr. Justice Sankey with extraordinary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
tact and great judgment. In the course of our revision of these exemptions granted in 1915, we came across an immense number of cases of Germans who ought to have been interned. We advised their internment and they were interned. Unfortunately, we had not anything like time to complete that revision. The Armistice came and our labours ceased. An immense number of Germans who had been granted exemptions in 1915 remained uninterned. Why? Because we had not been able to reach their cases and revise the whole list. Consequently, in 1918 an enormous number were exempted who, if they had come before our Committee, would, I think, have been locked up. Let me say one word about these uninterned Germans. Many of those who were uninterned and deliberately given exemption were young Germans. The Committee thought it was better to allow a certain number of these men loose in order that they might do work on munitions and other national work rather than keep them in idleness doing nothing. For that reason they were exempted from internment. I want to know from the Home Secretary whether these young Germans have been sent home. I trust that they have, at any rate, I submit that they ought to be. If the Clause I propose is passed, most unquestionably they will go to their homes and we shall be glad to get rid of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that state of things what this Clause proposes is to send back all enemy aliens in this country to their own countries, but we propose to do something more kind to the Germans than was mentioned either by the Prime Minister or by the Lord Chancellor. We propose to grant exemptions in certain proper cases, exemptions which I have formulated as well as I could with those who have helped me in regard to this Clause. I am revealing no secrets of what happened in the Advisory Committee when I say that from time to time cases came before us upon which we should have been only too grateful for the assistance of Parliament in laying down principles upon which we should intern or exempt them. Time after time there were certain differences of opinion in the Committee, as I suppose there are in every Committee, and had it not been for the tact of Mr. Justice Sankey I doubt if we should have held together. The moral of it to my mind was that whenever a Committee of that sort is set up for the purpose of exempting Ger-
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
mans from internment or repatriation, it is vital that Parliament should lay down in general terms the principles upon which exemptions should be granted, and then, as we have done in this Clause, leave a certain discretion in certain cases to the Home Secretary in respect of cases which could not be provided for or seen in advance. I will go through the Clause very shortly. The first Sub-section provides that every former enemy alien now in the United Kingdom shall be deported forthwith unless he makes an application to the Home Secretary stating the grounds upon which he claims exemption. Again, that is the result of my experience upon the Committee. People claimed exemption upon the most frivolous and ludicrous grounds. If Parliament lays down the grounds upon which they may be exempted they will know where they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Sub-section provides for advertising notice of the application in a local paper. That is exceedingly important, because it enables the persons in the locality, who know the man, to have knowledge that he is applying for an exemption, and if there is anything special to be communicated either to the police or Home Secretary about him, in all probability that will be done. Sub-section (3) lays down the principles upon which exemption may be granted. The first is that of an exemption in favour of friendly aliens, men like the Poles, Czecho-Slovaks, and so on, who are certified by the proper authority to be well-disposed to this country. The second case of exemption is that of a man of seventy years of age and who has been at least fifteen years resident in the United Kingdom. That seems to be reasonable. The third is where an applicant is suffering from serious illness or infirmity of a permanent character. The fourth is one with which we should all feel sympathy, that is where the applicant has one or more sons who voluntarily enlisted and served in His Majesty's Forces or with one of the Allied Powers. The fifth is where an applicant has lived for at least thirty-five years in this country and married a British-born wife. That is inserted partly for the benefit of the Brtishborn wife and partly for the applicant's own benefit. The last exemption is for a woman who has married a former enemy alien who is now abroad, but who was at the time of her marriage a British subject and who wants to remain in this country. She, although technically
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
an enemy alien, ought to be exempted. This Sub-section provides for the discretion of the Home Secretary in special cases which are not covered by the previous exemption. I grant cases might arise which have not been specially provided for by these provisions, and in these cases he had to consider and be satisfied
	<br><blockquote><p>"that owing to the exceptional circumstances of the case deportation would involve serious hardship of a personal nature on the applicant."</p></blockquote>
There is also provision for a list of persons to whom the licence is granted. I recommend this Clause to the Committee as carrying out the pledges of the head of the Government and some of the most responsible members of the Government. I recommend it to the Committee because I think it is a good opportunity of taking the first step in avoiding pernicious legislation by Order in Council and returning to normal peace times. I recommend it because I think in this way, and this way only, will you enable the Committee which the Home Secretary appoints to advise him to do their duty and to carry out the wishes of the country, and instead of being influenced in their decisions, as it is possible they might be, by personal or passing reasons, to be guided in their decisions by principles which have received the sanction of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REID</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I am going to take what the Mover of this Clause will consider a most unpatriotic course in submitting that this Clause is quite unnecessary. So far as the hon. and learned Member dealt with this Clause I think he ruined his own case, if I may say so quite bluntly. Let us look at the position of affairs. As he said, at the beginning of the War, or in the early days of the War, internments began. I think they began before 1915. At any rate, in 1915 there was a considerable clearance into internment camps of Germans, and those who were exempted were exempted on the advice of the Advisory Committee. The hon. and learned Member says that a great many of these people were exempted on what he considered flimsy grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1915.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REID</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be. Still that Committee was a Committee headed by one of His Majesty's judges and was composed of men of very considerable experience and with very considerable knowledge of the world. Notwithstanding my friendship and admiration for the hon. and learned Gentleman who has moved
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
the Clause, I am not prepared to take his word entirely as being sufficient to deprive the views of that Committee of all authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I was not on the Committee in 1915, but that I was on the Committee in 1918. That the 1918 Committee did their work very leniently was shown by the fact that we in many eases upset their decisions and interned the Germans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REID</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I must still stick to what I have said. Having gone into this matter, the hon. and learned Member is certain that the work was too leniently done in 1915. But practically all Germans of military age and the bulk of the others were, in fact, interned. There were others who were exempted on the advice of the Advisory Committee. Those who were exempted on the advice of the Advisory Committee had their cases reconsidered by the Committee of which the hon. and learned Member was a member. Those were the cases of people who were exempted. The people who were not exempted were either safely under lock and key or had been returned to Germany. He says, and says truly, that that Committee for its own guidance formulated a certain series of qualifications which would permit them to allow a man to remain in this country. Those are the qualifications which he has put down in this Clause. On those lines the list of people who have been exempted were revised and a considerable number of those who had been exempted were interned. I do not think it necessarily follows that in all cases the Advisory Committee in 1915 was wrong, because in the course of two or three years there may have been changes of circumstances and additional information may have come to light. At any rate, here we have in black and white rules which that Committee formulated for its own guidance, and on those lines the list of people who had not been interned was revised. Therefore, in 1918 we get into a position where the Germans whose internment was considered advisable had been interned, and the only people who were exempted were people who had passed through the comb of two separate Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the present position. There are a number of people who are not interned and who have passed through the comb of two separate Committees. There are also Germans who are at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
internment camps. The hon. and learned Member says that on the day of the Armistice there were 23,000 or 24,000 of these people. Since that date a very large number of Germans have voluntarily returned to Germany. Take, for instance, the Isle of Man, where the biggest internment camps were situated. At Knockaloe camp at one time there were 23,000 interned Germans. At the date of the Armistice, of the men over military age and the men who were unfit for military service for medical reasons, a large number had already been sent back to Germany. At Douglas there were over 2,000. Since the Armistice the Douglas camp has been closed. At the present time at Knockaloe there are only 1,300 or 1,400 Germans. So that you have many Germans who have voluntarily returned home. There are 3,000 or 4,000 interned Germans left in this country. At the present time a Committee is sitting with Mr. Justice Younger as chairman, and I think it is composed entirely of Members of this House. That Committee is deciding what is to be the ultimate fate of Germans at present interned. If the Committee advises that they should be repatriated they will be repatriated; if they advise that they may be released I suppose they will be released. My real objection to this Clause is not because of any tenderness towards the Germans. My objection is that the work has been done and what the hon. and learned Member is asking the Committee to do is to suggest that the work which has been done should be done over again. That will be a waste of time and labour. I submit that the present machinery and the machinery that has been in operation is quite sufficient for the task. All the uninterned Germans have passed through the comb of two Committees and the last Committee revised the list on the grounds stated in this new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the hon. Member not to misrepresent my statement. The last Committee did not revise the list of 1915. It had partially done its work but the Armistice came before it completed its work and the result was that a large number of men whom we would have liked to intern remained uninterned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REID</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's statement, but the problem is very much smaller than the one he seeks to attack in this Clause. The object of this
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Clause is to do over again work the bulk of which has been done and it would cause a vast amount of time to be wasted, and also a waste of energy and money which would do no good to anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir HERBERT NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened very carefully to what the hon. Member has just said and it seems to me that his only reason for objecting to this Clause is the waste of judicial and Parliamentary time on the part of the persons engaged. I think a very sufficient answer has been given by my hon. and learned Friend when he says that the standards of 1915, which were considerably tightened up in 1918 were not able to be applied to a very large number of persons before the Armistice came and arrested their operations. What I feel, and what I think the people of this country feel and are determined to have, is that there should not be a standard which is set up by any body of gentlemen which may be varied in accordance with their own impressions of the particular needs of the moment, but that there should be a rigid statutory standard which these people must comply with if they are to be exempt from the operations of this Act. We rely upon the pledges of Ministers. You cannot get rid of them if the Government really intends to carry out the pledges of its prominent members. I would draw attention to a speech made by the present Lord Chancellor at West Derby on 2nd December last, reported in the "Times" of the 3rd December. There is nothing in the speech to qualify this statement—
	<br><blockquote><p>"He recently paid that all interned Germany ought to be sent back to Germany. He did not as a Minister make that statement without satisfying himself that he was entitled to make it. He did not make that statement without consulting the Prime Minister."</p></blockquote>
He proceeded to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You may take it from me that it is the view of the Prime Minister himself that every German interned in this country at present shall at the earliest possible moment after the conclusion of peace be returned to his own country."</p></blockquote>
That is a statement said to have been made after consultation with the Prime Minister, and it gives specifically the Prime Minister's view. It is not qualified in any way whatever, and it gives a pledge that at the earliest possible moment after the conclusion of Peace every German interned in this country at that moment, the 2nd December, should be sent back to his own country. I am not sure that I followed the date of the speech of the Prime
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
Minister at the Queen's Hall from which my hon. and learned Friend quoted. I have here a speech made by the Prime Minister at Newcastle. The Home Secretary will have heard that speech, because I think he accompanied the Prime Minister on that occasion. This is what the Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What about those people whom we received without question for years to our shores—[A Voice: 'Send them back']—who, after we did so and gave them equal rights with the sons and daughters of our own households abused our hospitality, to betray the land that received them; to plot against its security, to spy upon it, and to supply information and weapons to enable the Prussian War Lords to inflict not punishment, but damage and injury on the land which had received and entertained them. Never again; the interests of security demand it; the interests of fairplay demand it; and, what is more, it has to be made perfectly clear to nations which behave like that that they must face the military result and punishment for their conduct."</p></blockquote>
That is pretty conclusive from the Prime Minister, Before the Lord Chancellor made the speech from which I have quoted, he spoke on behalf of his friend Captain Guest, in East Dorset, at Branksome. I am quoting from the "Times," 2nd December:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are going to send every one of them back. I tell you here as a Minister of the Coalition Government that it is the declared policy of that Government to send back to Germany every Boche in this country. We have no friends amongst them, though Mr. Ramsay Macdonald has."</p></blockquote>
Speaking in the House of Lords on the 3rd April, the Lord Chancellor made another important declaration. He was attacked on the 24th March by a certain Noble Lord as to his statement that there were 20,000 Germans ready to come over here any day. On the 3rd April he made his brilliant defence. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I ask another question, because if we are to speak plainly of these things, it is very desirable that we should understand them clearly. Are we not, in deciding this matter, to consider actual acts which have been done by the German nation in the course of this war? Are we, in other words, to treat them exactly as if we were ending a war with South Africa or a war with the French? There are great numbers of people in this country, of whom I am one, who take the view that we have never contended with an enemy so completely vile and unmoral in his acts.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Several Noble Lords: 'Hear, hear.' "</p></blockquote>
All these new Clauses refer to the subjects of countries who were formerly at war with us, including Bulgaria, Turkey and Austria. Although there is much to be said in regard to the particular barbarities, there can be no doubt that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
main cause of the offences, the instigator of the whole of the atrocities of the war was Germany. Therefore, the Lord Chancellor singles Germany out. He goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is not the country entitled to take that view? Are the men whose children have died as the result of air raids; are the men and the women, many of whom have given three and four children—all they had—who have died as a result of poison gas, which before this war was looked upon as a vile abomination, not to be entitled to say, 'This nation has done these wicked things; no other nation in the history of the world has or ever would do them; we do not want the representatives of that people to live amongst us except under circumstances that are wholly exceptional?' [Several Noble Lords: 'Hear, hear.' "]</p></blockquote>
Again it was cheered by the House. I do not want to go on quoting, for the next is scarcely relevant, but the Noble Lord gives a test, and he says the test should be this:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If on the other hand where such a man goes before the Committee he says to himself, 'In my conscience I am clear that I can satisfy any body of fair men that I have throughout shown complete integrity to the substituted allegiance which I have adopted'—if he can show that, of course, the Committee must give proper weight. Of course, the Committee must distinguish between individual cases. Of course, the Committee must make a difference between a man whose son has served and a man who, when he is asked, 'Is there anything special about your case, is there anything you can say to the Committee except that you are a German,' says, 'No, I have no other recommendation, I am a German.' I said at the Election that that man ought to go, and if I were fighting another election tomorrow I should say the same thing. It is my honest and firm conviction, and as far as I have reason to believe, it is the policy of the Government to-day, as it was certainly the policy of the Government at the time of the last Election."</p></blockquote>
So that we have the Noble Lord on 3rd April repeating in effect those very definite statements that he made on the authority of the Prime Minister on 29th November and 2nd December. It will be answered that this matter is dealt with, and can be dealt with adequately under the draft Order in Council which the Home Secretary has promulgated. The bedrock objection to this dealing with this Bill is that we dislike Orders in Council because they are made behind the back of Parliament, and are alterations of the law, very often of a vital kind, over which Parliament can have no control. I want to ask the Committee to realise what was the condition of this country. Those of us who know—and I see around me some of them, and possibly yourself, Sir—something about the Eastern part of London in the early sixties and seventies, and even in the later seventies,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
ask ourselves if we can identify to-day that part of London as we remember it. I agree a great deal of this has been done by the Russian and Polish Jews, and all these populations of South Eastern Europe, but it has very largely been contributed by the Germans. There is no doubt that in the east of London to-day where the comb has been, that we have discovered the men who have come over here for the express purpose not only of damaging us from an economic point of view, but from the point of view of trade and commerce. They have been able gradually to oust our population: they have ousted them throughout the East End of London. Some who would have preferred to remain as burgesses of Stepney, Poplar, and Hackney, have been driven away because the conditions of things which the foreigner have produced and which has made it so intolerable that neither they nor their children can any longer live in the homes where their parents lived for years. Districts which were wholly respectable, as respectable as any area within five miles of Charing Cross could possibly be, have been debased and altered. I have not the least doubt that those of us who, in our earlier legal career, as members of the Junior Bar, have taken briefs to go down to the County Court, which has always had a very substantial business by reason of the docks in its jurisdiction—I refer to the Bow County Court—will remember the magnificent houses in the Bow Road, which are still there but divided up into tenements, and which are debased so far as their inhabitants are concerned, and generally depreciated.

So bad had the scandal become that in the Parliament of 1900–5 the hon. and gallant Member for Stepney (Captain Evans Gordon) brought the matter up constantly in the House. A Royal Commission was appointed. It took abundant evidence. This volume of evidence is several inches thick and I wish I had been able to bring the copy I possess in order to show the Committee how carefully the matter was gone into. The Commission reported that certain measures ought to be taken by the Government to rid themselves and the country of this burden. As a result of the Report, I think it was in 1904, a Bill was introduced into the House. The old party system was in full blast—more's the misfortune for the country—and the result was that the Bill was attacked violently, and had, I think, to be withdrawn for want of
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
time. In 1905 it was reintroduced. It was opposed and attacked by Front and Back bench men by a virulence which was hardly understandable in view of events which had happened since. The Act as it came out of the House was a very different thing from the Bill that went in. It purported to contain powers allowing the Home Office to regulate the immigration of these people. It consisted of ten sections and purported to deal with the mischief. What was the effect of it? No sooner had the change of Government taken place in the first week of December, 1905, than by an administrative Order of Lord Gladstone, the then Home Secretary, the beneficial operation of that Act was wholly destroyed. People were allowed to come in practically without any restriction at all. One can perhaps scarcely realise the enormous traffic that set in at that time. No doubt the Order of Mr. Gladstone was issued from humane considerations and with the best motives, and it was perhaps strengthened by the fact that in 1905 there occurred those shocking massacres throughout Southern Russia. About then, too, the Jewish pogroms started. It was said, and I believe truly, that these were deliberately organised. The result was that these poor creatures flying from that country caused a stream of immigrants from Libau to Hull and other places on the East Coast of England, and this considerably added to the population with which we have to deal in Stepney and Poplar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a question in which administrative action has hitherto been completely paralysed in anything like definite treatment. I venture to say that the consequence of the experience we have had as a result of those matters, and of the terrible experience we have had of the German national character throughout this War, we see matters differently. I do beg this Committee to accept this Clause as being a statutory enactment compelling the authorities to deal with this subject in a specific way, and not to allow a measure of control as we have always done, for as a certain Lord Chancellor said, the administration of the law of equity is the measure of the Lord Chancellor's foot. I do want, and I say the country demands, that this subject should be dealt with on a statutory basis, and that is why my hon. and learned Friend has taken the trouble, after consideration, and out of the great knowledge that he possesses of the work before the Committees, to frame in detail a Clause which is sufficiently far-reaching to be able-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
to set at rest the minds of the most captious and those possessed of humane and ultra-humane feelings and principles, who would desire to have these people dealt with as reasonably as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir WILLIAM PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want absolutely to contradict the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I am sure the Committee do not want to have anything that is likely to mislead them. I have had a very long and extensive acquaintance with the East End of London and I was very much surprised to hear the hon. Member ascribe to the German element the feature of being so much in possession. My experience—and it is confirmed by what I have been told by one of the officials present who has a most intimate knowledge of the East End—is that it is almost entirely Russian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And always has been. This has not been a German, but a Russian invasion. In regard to the big houses in the Bow Road—which are still there—I do not think the foreign element is spread very far. It is quite true there are industrial dwellings now, but these are largely in the occupation of Britishers. Still, the influx of foreigners into the East End has been a most serious thing, and a large portion of the Borough of Stepney has been burdened with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite right. But my point is not that there has not been an enormous influx of foreigners, but that there are very few Germans: that they are almost entirely Yiddish. The influx, I think, has swamped White chapel and the Boroughs of Stepney and St. George's-in-the-East. So far as Bow Road is concerned the houses and the new flats are very largely in the occupation of British workmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir FRANCIS LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not sat on any of these Committees relating to aliens, and I have no particular knowledge of the aliens living either in the East End, or in any other particular part of the country. Therefore I come to the consideration of the Clause with a perfectly free and independent mind. I want, if I can, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
take a commonsense view of the matter, and I ask the Committee to do the same. If we look at the Clause—and we must remember we are now dealing with the Second Reading—what is the underlying principle that it lays down—that all enemy aliens in this country should be deported I There may be exemptions and exceptions, but that is the underlying principle. Will any member of the Committee deny or hesitate to affirm for a single moment that that principle was laid down at the time of the General Election: that the Government pledged themselves to it, and that the electors of this country by overwhelming majorities confirmed and adopted that principle? Very well then; it seems to me that there ought not to be any question whatever about our affirming the principle that is to give a Second Beading to this Clause of which this is the underlying principle. You may not approve of the rest of the Clause. The representatives of the Government may not approve of the rest of the Clause. They may on grounds set forth in Committee, add to the exemptions, but if the Amendment is not complete, and if there should be other grounds to be inserted let them propose it in any way they think best. But as representing the Coalition Government they are pledged to this principle and they cannot afford to, and must not resist, the Second Reading of this Clause. It is all very well to talk about the matter being in the hands of Mr. Justice Sankey's Committee, or about it being decided to do all this by Order in Council. That is not what we want. We want it put into an Act of Parliament. We want something on the Statute Book which shall guide the administrative action of the Home Secretary in these matters, and we want him to be bound by that Act. Then the House of Commons will be able to see that what we want is effectively done. Personally, and very strongly, I appeal to the Home Secretary as representing the Government not to oppose the Second Reading of this Clause. If there are any details of it to which the Government object by all means let them say so and let us discuss these details, but with reference to the principle there should be no question or doubt whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut. - Commander KENWORTHY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I be allowed to say a very few words in appreciation of the hon. and learned Member's efforts exercised in the cause of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
the treatment of aliens in this country. I am going to oppose the Clause. Before I do so, I want to say that I think we all appreciate the hon. and learned Member's very fine stand in seeing there were no spies or persons harmful to the country left at large during the War.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the hon. and gallant Member that we can only discuss the Clause, and not the conduct of hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut. - Commander KENWORTHY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming straight to the Clause, but I wanted to make my position perfectly clear. I shall oppose the Clause, and in as few words as possible I will give my reasons. During the General Election at which I was a candidate this matter came up in my Constituency. My pledge was that while aliens could be shown to be dangerous to the country during the War—and as was remarked by the hon. Member below the comb went very closely through them—that they should be got out of the country as soon as possible. We should return them to their own country. That is amply covered in the Bill already, and with the Orders in Council, which, although they are much attacked, nevertheless give the Home Secretary sufficient power to do that. It is not for me to suggest that the Home Secretary is too lenient in these cases. I think he is quite to be trusted to deal effectively with them. I only want, however, to attack the whole spirit of this idea of getting every German, willy-nilly, out of the country. Let us go to the root of the fact that the most hated of our late enemies is the German. This will be the first Bill, or one of the first, put on the Statute Book after the signature of Peace. But, I think, things have changed in the last seven months. There was a great feeling of indignation at the time of the election. The majority of the people, if asked, would have said that all Germans were to be kept out of the country, and never come back again. In the last seven months there has been a change. That change will become even more evident in the future. I think the first was the feeling, the very natural feeling, of people suffering with the stress and strain of the War. It is, however, statesmanship now that is the need. Every responsible person should attempt his best to try to remove the causes of inter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
national hatred as much as possible. The principle laid down in this Clause that every German—it does not matter what service he has performed during the War, or the country he was living in, or his feelings towards this country—shall, because he is a German, be deported out of England and not allowed back is wrong. The hon. and learned Member for York (Sir J. Butcher) is probably thinking in his mind that I am unpatriotic and tender to the Germans. I am nothing of the sort. Let me give you one instance. A constituent of mine came to me a few weeks ago. He was a demobilised soldier who had won his corporal's strides in the field, had been wounded and had a decoration for valour. I would particularly request the hon. and learned Member to listen to this case, because he may have had similar cases in York. This man came to me and said he wanted a passport to go to Cologne, the reason being that he wanted to marry a German girl whom he had met during the occupation. I said to him, "This is extraordinary. I do not feel quite justified in helping you. What is the particular reason?" He said, "I ought to marry that girl as a man of honour."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not seem to be very germane.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander KENWORTHY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can show it is very germane. I asked this man whether there were any other reasons apart from that he had given, and he replied that he had met this girl when he was in the Army of Occupation in Cologne and he was fond of her. That sort of thing is going on in the Army in Cologne. Human nature will not keep up hatred against a nation, in spite of all we have gone through. I am sorry that hon. Members below me who are supporting this Clause do not take this matter seriously. It is meant seriously. There is a changed feeling amongst the rank and file of the country. I fought at the General Election on this question. I took the attitude I take now, that people who were pronounced dangerous during the War should be sent out and not allowed back. I was unsuccessful at the General Election. I fought a by-election and this question hardly came up at all. Are we, directly Peace is signed, to keep up this vindictive-ness—I admit it is human nature and natural in a way, but we hope for a new era in the world—and perpetuate this hatred in the first Act of Parliament to be passed after the Peace? The Home Sec-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
retary has sufficiently wide powers by Orders in Council. We may trust him in most cases to carry out what is necessary. It would be a mistake and not true statesmanship to pass this Clause. I may be making an appeal to deaf ears, but I make my protest. The instance I gave of the soldier who was not ashamed to go back to Cologne to marry a German girl shows that in a few years there will be a change in public opinion. As the hon. Member for Salford said at a public meeting the other day,
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have beaten the enemy; let us be sportsmen now, and shake hands."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In spite of the very stern command of my hon. Friends opposite that the Government must not oppose this Clause, I propose to oppose it and to ask the Committee to reject it. Up to the present the Debate appears to have proceeded upon the lines that anyone who ventures to question, not the pledge of the Prime Minister in the least, but the method suggested by the hon. and learned Member for York (Sir J. Butcher) for carrying out that pledge, must be taken to be false to that pledge. I protest against any such conclusion. I am as true to the pledge as my hon. and learned Friend is, but I think his method of carrying it out is hopelessly the wrong one. When we are dealing with pledges I, of course, accept the position of the Lord Chancellor, the then Attorney-General in the Government, but it is the Prime Minister's pledge that is the binding pledge. To the Prime Minister's pledge I propose to adhere. I presume that the framers of this suggested Clause also had it in mind that they would carry out the pledge of the Prime Minister. If that is so it is perfectly clear that they do not read the Prime Minister as having pledged himself that every single German is to be turned out of this country. That cannot be the pledge, otherwise this Clause does not carry out the pledge. This Clause itself admits that there must be exceptions and all it seeks to do is to tie the hands of the Secretary of State as to what exceptions may be reasonably expected. That is the sole thing this Clause does. It does not in the least suggest that every German, no matter who or what he is, should be turned out of this country because he happens to be a German. The Clause provides for a great number of exceptions—very wide exceptions. I am perfectly content—I know it is the correct inter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
pretation — to interpret the Prime Minister's pledge upon the basis of the interpretation of that pledge which is to be found in this proposed Clause. What is it that this Clause proposes to do? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every former enemy alien who is now in the United Kingdom shall be deported forthwith"—</p></blockquote>
unless certain things happen. In so far as that indicates an intention to turn out of this country every dangerous German everyone will agree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the test, danger?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only want to know. I understand the Prime Minister's pledge was to turn them all out. Rightly or wrongly we introduced certain exceptions. Does the right hon. Gentleman say that the Prime Minister's pledge was only to turn out dangerous Germans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said nothing of the sort. If my hon. and learned Friend will interrupt me before I have half finished a sentence he is bound to misunderstand what I am going to say. I did not say anything of the sort. If it is true, as he says, that the Prime Minister's pledge was to turn out every German then no one is falser to the Prime Minister's pledge than my hon. and learned Friend, because this Clause does nothing of the sort. Danger must of necessity be not only one of the grounds for turning them out but must be the main ground. The Prime Minister never for a moment pledged himself to turn Germans out as a means of revenge or as a means of punishment. The Prime Minister had in his mind the protection for all time of our own country. It is our protection in which we are concerned. If it were purely a question of punishment or of revenge there is not one of these exemptions that would stand the test. Let us look at these exemptions and see where we stand. The first is if the applicant happens to be of a nationality or race
	<br><blockquote><p>"hostile to the States recently at war with His Majesty and is well disposed to His Majesty and his Government."</p></blockquote>
What we may have when the Bill is passed I do not know, but at the present moment there is no definition of
	<br><blockquote><p>"a member of a nation or a race hostile to the States recently at war with His Majesty."</p></blockquote>
One has a notion of what is intended to be covered by those words, but still they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
leave a fairly wide discretion to the Secretary of State. Again what is the meaning of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Well disposed to His Majesty and his Government."</p></blockquote>
Who is to be the judge of that? The Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had no difficulty about that on the Advisory Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is to be responsible for deciding the matter, therefore hon. Members are leaving a discretion to him just as much as he would have under the Order in Council. The Clause further says that a man is to be exempted if he
	<br><blockquote><p>"is seventy years of age or upwards and has been at least fifteen years resident in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
Is that to be universal, or is it to be discretionary? Will the Secretary of State be bound to allow anyone of seventy years of age to remain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my right hon. Friend will read my Clause. It is discretionary. It says "may."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly my point, that it is "may." If the man is seventy years of age, and has lived here for fifteen years, and is thought to be a dangerous man and ought to be turned out, who is to decide it? The Secretary of State again. So it goes on right through. The Clause says there may be exemption on the ground that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the applicant is suffering from serious illness or infirmity of a permanent nature."</p></blockquote>
If a man loses his eye that is an infirmity of a permanent nature, but that would not prevent him from being a dangerous spy. Who is to decide? The Secretary of State right through. Hon Members leave here exactly the same discretion as is given to the Secretary of State by the Orders in Council. The Clause ties his hands to a certain extent but not entirely, and it is bound to require from time to time alteration as we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is here one of the Gentlemen whose names are attached to this Clause, and I have in my box in my room a long letter from him dealing with the case of a German who does not come within any one of the exceptions of this Clause, and he presses me to allow that man to stay in this country. Those questions are bound to arise. The Order in Council, as suggested, gives to the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
power to deport anyone if he deems it to be conducive to the public good to make a deportation order. All these exemptions, of course, will be taken into consideration always, but the result of stereotyping things and putting them into an Act of Parliament will be to give an appearance of panic to the rest of the world, and absolutely to tie the hands of the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State had a case which he would rather deport, and it came within one of these exemptions, would he not be bound, unless there were something very serious, to exempt him. On the other hand, if he had a free hand, he could let him go. Under the Order in Council any case can be brought up in the House of Commons and the Secretary of State can be arraigned in the House of Commons if he does not carry the matter out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole question between us is one of method. There is no question of principle involved. It is a pure question of method, and it is a question of whether the best method is to tie the hands of the Secretary of State, or to leave him with a discretion. I have no hesitation in saying, and everyone who has had any work to do in connection with alien committees and so on, with the exception of my hon. and learned Friend (Sir J. Butcher), will agree that discretion is the wiser thing. We have now sitting a Committee dealing with the question of repatriation, and we have had Committees dealing with the question of internment. They went into the matter, and they interned those that they thought ought to be interned. Equally, with regard to the question of repatriation, they are repatriating those that they think ought to be repatriated. They go carefully into each case. There is the machinery in the Home Office. There are highly experienced people who go into these cases. We are in complete touch, because it is under the Home Office, with our Secret Service, and there is no better Secret Service in the world. We have full information. We know exactly who are the dangerous men and who are not, and the far more effective way of carrying out the Prime Minister's pledge is to leave this matter to the discretion of the Secretary of State, with all his machinery and all his means of knowledge. Although the number of spies in this country was not by any means exaggerated, the danger from those spies was greatly exaggerated, because, although perhaps one man in

	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
ten thousand did not know it, we had the most efficient Secret Service in the world. I ask the Committee to reject this proposed Clause. It simply ties our hands and gives us no greater efficiency. It in no way carries out the pledge of the Prime Minister better than will be done under the proposed Order in Council, and it is a method of legislation in these matters which I sincerely hope the House of Commons will never adopt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the right hon. and learned Gentleman will be profoundly disappointing to the large majority of this Committee. It will disappoint the hon. and gallant Gentleman behind me (Lieut.-Com. Kenworthy) quite as much as my hon. and learned Friend beside me (Sir J. Butcher), because he opposed this Clause on the ground that he wants to shake hands with all the Germans. He does not want to have them excluded. The right hon Gentleman, however, opposes it on quite opposite grounds. He opposes it merely because he thinks that he has a better method of doing that which my hon. and learned Friend desires to do by his Clause. I am extremely disappointed with the attitude that the Government have taken up. The reasons which the right hon. Gentleman has given appear to me to be about as flimsy as could possibly be given against a Clause of this sort. When I recall the fact that the right hon. Gentleman advanced as a reason against this Clause that to do the same thing by Act of Parliament instead of by Order in Council would look like panic, I really think that he must have been very hard put to it to find some reason for resisting this Clause. If the policy to be carried out by the Government is a right, just, and expedient policy, could anything be more absurd than to say that it is quite proper to do it by Order in Council, but if you put that policy into an Act of Parliament it immediately becomes tainted with the appearance of panic?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said—and as a matter of fact, I entirely disagree with him—that the pledge of the Prime Minister, which, after all, is the governing consideration in this matter, was by no means that the Germans in this country were to be cleared out as a matter of punishment, but merely that they were to be cleared out in order to protect this country against dangers which we had experienced during the War. I entirely traverse that statement. If you read the speeches which were made by the Prime
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
Minister, some of which have been quoted, you will see that nothing more is apparent than that the grounds upon which the Prime Minister based his policy were not merely the dangers which we had experienced in the War, but that the Germans, by their conduct, had abused the hospitality of this country and had proved themselves so obnoxious as neighbours that it would not be right to ask the country to tolerate them as guests in the future. That is really at the bottom of the popular feeling in the country. Although the right hon. Gentleman appears to have thought little of it, the great mass of Members of the present Parliament have been returned by their constituencies more upon this ground than upon any other. I can say that in my own Constituency and in others, the circumstances in which I know, that feeling was more strong among the working classes than among any others. I know that large bodies of the working classes whose support I do not think that I should have had upon any other ground volunteered to me the assurance that they were giving me their support simply because I was taking a strong line upon this very point. I used to say that I was for turning out the Hun and keeping him out, and among the electioneering catchwords used all over the country that one procured more votes for the Government and for the Coalition, especially from the working classes, than any other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to appeal to the right hon. Gentleman. All he says at the most is that he prefers his method of proceeding by Order in Council to our method of proceeding by Act of Parliament. Of course, he speaks as a lawyer, and I have no doubt that he thinks it will be easier to carry out his method and that he can deal with the matter more effectively by Order in Council. Apart, however, from being a lawyer and a Minister, he is also an experienced politician. Does he imagine for one moment that the policy which he is adopting is as likely to satisfy the feeling in the country as putting this Clause in the Bill? If he does, all I can do is to assure him that he is mistaken, and, if I did not put it on any other ground, I would ask him to reconsider his decision for this reason. If this Clause is resisted, and presumably if it is the next Clause to be proposed by my right hon. Friend and which in my opinion is even more important, will also be resisted, the result will be that you will have this matter fought out on the floor of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
House, where, I suppose, the Government, by putting on the Whips, will again be able to have their way, but you will certainly start a very widespread agitation in the country itself. I am certain that will be the case. Would it not be better, even supposing he thinks that he has got a better method, for the right hon. Gentleman to give way and to admit that there is something to be said for our methods and for him to consent to take the second best method from his own point of view rather than let one of the first Bills to be passed after the signing of peace be the signal for a widespread agitation throughout the country and for allegations to be made up and down the country that the Government have not fulfilled their pledges. Allegations which some of us at all events would feel it very difficult to deny. Would it not be much better for him to agree with what I believe to be the predominant feeling in this Committee? Let us have this particular policy embodied in an Act of Parliament, and then, after we have read the Clause a second time, if it requires any modification, let us consider the points which the right hon. Gentleman raises and almost every one of which is a Committee point. I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will be quite ready to meet the Home Secretary in Committee upon this Clause so as to hammer it into a shape which will be in conformity with his views and which will be easy to administer. Then we shall have passed this Bill without driving a great wedge, which there is great danger of doing, between the stiff-necked attitude which the Government are taking up and the predominant sense of the country upon this very important question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir ERNEST WILD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand the feeling of the Home Secretary if he thinks that anybody who is supporting this new Clause or any of the new Clauses imagines that he is not hostile to aliens; as hostile as we are. I assure him for myself and for those whom I am acting — for I would point out that considerable time and trouble has been given to the drafting of the proposed new Clauses, and they represent a very wide feeling in the House of Commons, so wide that I do not think the Government has appreciated the amplitude of it—that we do not imagine any such thing. While paying every tribute, not only to the patriotism of the right hon. Gentleman—it is almost impertinent to use such a word in
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
regard to him—and to the efficiency of his administration—I wish other Home Secretaries had been as efficient. I agree with him that this is a discussion of method. That is the only point of his speech with which I agree. It is a question of method, as to whether it is better to proceed by the machinery of the Home Office and Orders in Council, or whether it is better to proceed by a positive enactment in a Bill which has passed through Parliament. The Home Secretary's attitude now was not the attitude taken by the Government on the Second Reading of the Bill. If it had been the attitude of the Government the Government would have been beaten. There is no doubt about that. It would have been beaten on the Second Reading if it had not been that the Under-Secretary threw oil upon the troubled waters, and threw it in rather a curious way at the last moment. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The European situation governs. As soon as the situation allows, the Government would be glad to incorporate the drastic Regulations now under Orders in Council, and will submit them to the House as a permanent matter of legislation."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th April, 1919, col. 2807, Vol. 114.]</p></blockquote>
That was not the attitude taken by the Home Secretary to-day. The attitude to-day was not that it is a question of the European situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accepted a reduction from two years to a year in order that it might be done by the experience we had gained during the first year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. WILD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the attitude I quite agree. If the attitude is "Do not do it now but do it in a year's time," I agree, but that was not what I understood from the Home Secretary's speech to-day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. WILD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We pin the Government, down to this. We are going to pin them down upon this.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You must not think that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. WILD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the aliens' question as a whole and the attitude taken up, and upon which I definitely affirm that the Second Reading was got without a Division, was, "We want a year instead of two years." That was the concession that "in a year's time we are prepared to put a positive enact-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
ment in a Bill to carry out what is demanded by the House of Commons. Now they do not say "wait a year." What the Home Secretary said was that the better method—if it is a better method now it is a better method for all time—is to proceed by the Order in Council and not by legislation in Parliament. The view we take, and the view which the great majority of the House of Commons, in my judgment, take, is that we are sick and tired of Orders in Council. We think that the legislature should resume their rights and that they should legislate upon this important matter and leave details to Government Departments. By a peculiar 	<i>volte face</i>, the Home Secretary twitted us by saying that although we do not trust him we leave to him a certain discretion in Clause 3. We leave to him the discretion that is necessary, but it is subject to the general will of Parliament. With regard to the speech of my hon. and gallant Friend (Lieut.-Commander Ken-worthy) I need only say a word, because we view matters from an entirely different point of view. I would no more shake hands with a German while I live than I would with the devil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander KENWORTHY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Figuratively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. WILD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Either figuratively or physically. If the view is—and I know this is not the Home Secretary's view—that we are figuratively to kiss and make friends with the Germans it is not the view that we hold, and it is not the view that the country holds. That brings me to the point which the Home Secretary made in regard to danger. Our view is that you should regard every German as 	<i>prima facie</i> dangerous, and that it should lie upon him to prove that he is not. We should not have such a ridiculous waste of time and public money as was exhibited last week in the investigation that was held upon a certain naturalised person. We do not want that kind of thing. The view we take is that these people are dangerous, 	<i>prima facie</i>. These people whom we trusted and respected before the War have, many of them, turned out to be spies and plotters against this country. Therefore, we should have been perfectly within our right in saying "Turn them out, without exception!" We have not said that. In this new Clause, which has been drafted with care, and on which we are prepared to meet the Government as to details, we propose to treat them with
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
no undue moderation. As illustrating the danger of leaving matters to any public Department, we had not the draft Order in Council for the Second Reading of the Bill. We had an apology, and it was explained that it was not ready and we got it a few weeks afterwards. Here is the way in which it is proposed to deal with the deportation of aliens. Clause 12 of the Order in Council says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, in any of the cases, make a Deportation Order."</p></blockquote>
I quite agree that this is dealing with all the aliens and not only with enemy aliens, and it is left with the Secretary of State to make a Deportation Order in his discretion. Sub-Clause 6. says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"He may make Orders in any of the following cases."</p></blockquote>
That is practically a reproduction of the undemocratic Act of 1905, which, as I said in the House the other day was attacking the steerage passenger and not the Park Lane millionaire. The only addition to the old reasons on which the Secretary of State may make an order were in regard to convictions, or whether the man would be chargeable to the Poor Law. Sub-Clause c says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Secretary of State deems it to be conducive to the public good he may make a Deportation Order against an alien."</p></blockquote>
That all depends upon the personality of the Secretary of State. Supposing another Secretary of State came in who held the sort of view held by my hon. and gallant Friend (Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy), it is inconceivable that he would think it to the public good to deport any aliens. He would want to shake hands with them and let them all come in. We have a mandate, and if we can help it we are not going to leave it to the idiosyncrasies and personality of changing Secretaries of State. We are going to have a positive enactment upon the Statute Book, and if a Government comes in with different views let them have the responsibility of changing the law and not merely of changing the Secretary of State. The distinction between former enemy aliens and other aliens is a distinction which we who hold these views think should be observed. We feel that former enemy aliens are suspect, particularly Germans, and in these circumstances we intend to press this Clause here. We-hope that the Government will meet us. If the Government do not meet us we will fight them here, and we will fight them on the floor of the House, because the country
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V004P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
is a little suspicious of the Government in this matter. They have not forgotten the unfortunate fact that the Government never mentioned the aliens in the King's speech. Let me assure the Government that although we are loyal supporters of the Government I would rather see the Government fall than see any truckling on this question of aliens. As my hon. Friend has just said, it is a subject of all others that the people care about, and we do not intend, if we can help it, and we believe that the majority of the House will be with us, to leave it to the idiosyncrasies of the Secretary of State or the changing circumstances of the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TYSON WILSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a good deal this morning about the Prime Minister and the Government and the pledges they have given. There are some of the pledges given by the Prime Minister and the Government which hon. Members who have been talking so much about pledges will be very pleased if they were not carried out. I am opposed to legislation by Order in Council. I am opposed to carrying out legislation by Order in Council, but I think if there is any subject to be dealt with by Order in Council this is the subject, for the simple reason that in dealing with aliens it is necessary that the responsible Minister should be allowed some elasticity. Therefore I shall vote against the Second Reading of this Clause. The Clause deals with the matter in a cast-iron fashion. I wonder whether the draftsmen have looked on the matter from the humorous side. Will the hon. and learned Members who have spoken tell the Committee whether this Clause proposes to deal with this question from the industrial, commercial, or political standpoint or from all three? Assuming that we are dealing with the matter from the political standpoint is not a man under seventeen years of age quite as dangerous as a man under seventy years of age? He is quite as dangerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and if he is dangerous he would be deported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the discretion of the Home Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. BUTCHER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, on the advice of the Advisory Committee who will go into all the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What Advisory Committee? There is no Advisory Committee set up here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. WILSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no necessity whatever to put this Clause into the Statute. It is a most ridiculous provision to put in the Statute that an applicant must have lived at least 35 years in this country and have married a British-born wife. That is really an insult to our cousins across the Atlantic. If an alien enemy is married to an American woman or to a French woman he is not entitled to the protection of the Statute, according to this Clause, as a man would be who has married a British-born woman. The Clause either goes too far or not far enough. I could understand it if it finished up by saying that all those aliens who get permits from the Secretary of State to remain in this country should wear a distinctive dress or a label of some kind, bearing the words, "I am an enemy alien." Surely we have got past that stage. Surely we are able to deal with these people without putting these sort of things in an Act of Parliament. I intend, and I think I can speak for my colleagues, to vote against the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HAYDAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow somewhat the same lines as the hon. Member who has just sat down. Provisions were made in 1915 to meet the circumstances at that time, and when we approached more serious times the provisions were tightened up and became more stringent in 1918. In my opinion the new Clause cannot be expected to deal with sets of circumstances that may or may not arise as a period of time passes. You cannot in an Act of Parliament embody hard and fast rules of the kind suggested, covering long periods of time. The new Clause seeks to set up rules for the guidance of this country that may not be applicable in two or three months time and may require revising. I am of opinion that the Bill as proposed gives powers quite sufficient to the Home Secretary and to the State to safeguard the interests of the State against what may be termed the dangerous element in our late enemy aliens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that hon. Members are approaching this question of our old enemy, the alien, in a manner more in the sense of blind and bitter prejudice. Perhaps it is not intended, but it is one calculated to bring out on the worst of the fears that are embodied in the timid section of our country, making them see in every Austrian and German who has been naturalised—because even they are in-

	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
cluded in the new Clause—[HON. MEMBERS: "NO, no."] Yes. The late enemy of the country—[HON. MEMBERS: "No, no"]—that even every person of enemy or alien country who has passed through the 1915 Committee of Inquiry, and the 1918 Committee of Inquiry, and satisfied the authority, set up that their circumstances having justified the country in permitting them to remain uninterned, that in those persons there exists that dangerous element that might break out at any time, and bring fear, anxiety, or distress to this country. Just as much as a previous hon. Member mistakenly attributed to the Germans entirely the elements in the East End of London. The elements in the East End of London were composed not of Germans or the Austrian population at all. My hon. and learned Friend says that the East End of London was honeycombed by Germans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HAYDAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must remember that the coming of the alien population years ago was due to the sweating employers who sent their agents out to foreign countries and invited these aliens into the country to work at sweated rates. This was the main reason that the Russian and Polish Jews came into the East End of London; it was not drawn from the country of our late enemies. I give place to no one in my desire to see that the measures meted out to our late enemy are what they deserve to have meted out. At the same time I feel what is proposed gives all the power that is necessary to the State Department to deal with the circumstances as they arise. I am not one who would give any measure of sympathy to those enemy aliens who have not satisfied us by going through the test of such Committees as have reviewed their status, and have become interned. I believe that in the majority of instances that these were part of the great scheme purposely foisted upon this country for some direct purpose. But I feel this, that the State Department, working in these
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
cases under the Orders in Council, can from time to time, according to the circumstances, pursue such a course as will safeguard the interests of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel R. GREENE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member who has just sat down says that there are a certain number of hon. Members who approach this matter in a spirit of what he calls blind prejudice. I came down to the Committee this morning with an open mind to listen to the arguments on every side. Unlike some hon. members of this Committee, I have no distrust of the Home Office. Like hon. Members of this Committee, I have absolute confidence in the present holder of the Office. But, in the first place, I venture to say that the arguments as to the pledges at the General Election are of no value at all. I entirely agree with the Home Secretary that it is only a question of how these pledges are to be carried out. I have not heard during this morning a single valid argument against the proposal to put this Clause into the Bill. The only argument I gathered was that the Home Secretary said it would do away with his discretion. I do not think that is entirely the case, because in Sub-section (4) of this Clause a very large discretion is given to him. It practically covers any case with which he would be required to deal. Concurrently with this Clause he will have also power by Order in Council. If this Clause does not cover the case he can still do so by employing an Order in Council. I am convinced, and I think the majority of the Committee agree, that what the people of this country, independent of party, really desire is to put into the Bill the actual detail so that they can read what is going to be carried out. I venture to hope the Home Secretary will see his way to accept this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. SHAW</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going to ask that the Clause should be rejected.

parents did not want him to serve in the German Army. That boy has never been back to Germany. He married an English wife, five of whose brothers fought in the War, and three of whom have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Neither the man nor his wife desire to go to Germany.

I merely say that for the dignity of the nation, in the belief that the nation is strong enough to conduct its business, in the belief that we have no need to fear in view of our Secret Service, or that the Home Office or that the country itself will neglect its duties, I am going to vote against the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major Sir EDWARD COATES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my appeal to the Government to give this Clause a Second Reading. I do so because I, like everyone in this Committee, had the opportunity at the General Election of discussing this question of aliens with thousands of electors. I know full well what the feeling was. I do not think that feeling has died out. One thing I believe is that the British public, the elector himself, has no knowledge of what is called an Order in Council. He does not realise what it is. But he does realise what plain English is. He would like to see the enemy aliens of this country deported. He would like to see that down in black and white. We have got it in black and white in the first two lines of this Clause. One hon. Member speaking on the opposite side said there was no elasticity in this Clause. I think there is a great deal of elasticity in it. The great point, it seems to me, is to give this Clause a Second Reading, and if it wants more elasticity that can be added in Committee. I have no desire to-day to do so, but if it

May I ask the hon. and gallant Gentleman to read Subsections (3) and (4) of this proposed Clause, in which there are definite reasons for exemption given upon which the Home Secretary can act. Sub-section (4) says that if there are cases in which a German or other ought to be exempted … then the Home Secretary may exempt him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not touch the point</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major LANE-FOX</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid my view still remains unchanged by what my hon. and learned Friend has said. However, if that is the best explanation that can be given, I shall have to be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know exactly what my hon. and learned Friend is saying. This Clause is not confined to interned alien enemies at all; not in the least. This Clause does not define, or does not purport to define, an enemy alien. I am perfectly well aware that an Amendment later will be moved, and" which will be opposed, but we cannot discuss this Clause as though that Amendment had been passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, you can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we cannot. That will be opposed, and strongly, not only here, but in the House. The proposed Clause does not deal with only interned enemy aliens; it deals with any enemy aliens, and this Clause, if passed, will be passed without any definition of what an enemy alien is, and this will mean that enemy aliens of any kind will be subject to this Clause. This Clause will be there for all time. It is not limited, like the rest of the Bill, for one year. The result will be that if you do not get your Amendment every single enemy alien, no matter who or what, will be subject to this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Really, the last statement of the Home Secretary cannot be allowed to pass; it is intolerable. The right hon. Gentleman really thinks this is the first Bill some of us have been engaged in. The idea of supposing that you cannot pass a Clause because the necessary definition is deferred to a later stage is really the most intolerable suggestion we have heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You cannot pass it on the ground that the Amendment has been passed already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, if you have a term that requires definition and propose a definition later on the Order Paper, you can discuss the Amendment on the assumption that your definition will be carried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the right hon. and learned Gentleman says this will be opposed, and that then the definition Clause may be rejected, he knows perfectly well that it is only his own opposition that is likely to defeat it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I know that!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Clause is passed, the right hon. Gentleman will then have to choose whether, having had to obey the opinion of the House, he will render the Clause nugatory by objecting to the definition Clause in order to make the Clause inefficient, or whether he will support what will be purely a consequential Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to vote against the Government if I can help it, and I shall be glad to help the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
if I can. It does appear to me that in this Clause the difference between hon. Gentlemen opposite and the Government is not so much. This Clause only turns on the question of enemy aliens who are now in this country. But the important Clause, to my mind, is the next one, which asks what are the Government going to do with regard to the right of entry? I think the present Home Office and the Government can be trusted, and the Regulations and Orders in Council can be trusted, to deal with the enemy aliens who are now here, and, therefore, I am very disinclined to vote against the Government on a Clause like this. I think they may be trusted to deal with the matter by Order in Council. With regard to the arrival of enemy aliens in future, I do submit to the Committee that this is of very much more importance than the Government attitude on this Clause. I, therefore, suggest it is not wise to vote against the Government on a Clause like this. We ought to preserve our pressure until the next Clause, which concerns the arrival of the aliens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. McNEILL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but supposing the next Clause is not carried, and there are no powers taken by the Bill to keep the Germans from coming here, you will have an influx of people here, and no power to turn them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. GREENWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me appeal to the Committee as one who under the supervision of the Home Secretary has to administer, and who is now, from day to day, administering the present law. This is a continuance of the present law in regard to aliens. I want to remind the Committee of the fact that the more you put into Statutes the greater you limit the discretion of the Home Secretary. I could give cases in an Act of Parliament, passed last Session—but I am not allowed to do so being an official—where by the limitation of the Statute, the Home Office was not able to deal with certain persons who could have been drastically dealt with, if the House of Commons in its wisdom and, as I think, it did not properly understand the meaning of wisdom on that occasion—had not limited the power of the Home Secretary. I would ask the Committee not to press this new Clause, and if pressed, to defeat it on the ground that by carrying it into law it will defeat the very object that these hon. Members have—and that I share with them in regard to enemy aliens. The Government, remember, is carrying out the law. If the

	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
Secretary of State deems it to be conducive to the public good he can make a Departmental Order against the alien which includes, of course, the enemy alien. My last point is that the numbers involved are negligible. All the interned enemy aliens now number about 4,000. Their cases are being considered from day to day, and we cannot go back on that. The uninterned Germans number about 6,500 men. The question is whether you are to leave them to this, I submit, the limiting qualifications of the new Clause moved by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for York,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>or whether you are to leave them, and everyone else who comes under the head of alien or enemy alien, to the discretion of the Home Secretary, who from day to day can be questioned in the House of Commons, and can revoke his Orders if made in error or unwisely, and who is ever subject to the paramount power of the House of Commons, which I consider is essential to the carrying out of any and every Statute.</p>
	<p>Question put, "That the Clause be now read a second time."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 14; Noes, 12.</p>

I should be inclined to move that we meet again in the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It simply means that we are going to take the Bill over a few months, and we shall never get it through. I do hope the Committee "will sit this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
