	<div class='title'>ORDER OF PROCEDURE.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say to the Members it is necessary to have an OFFICIAL REPORT of our proceedings, and, in order that the official reporter may not have difficulty in following the names of speakers it will be a convenience if hon. Members will, as far as possible, keep the same seats at each sitting. There is another matter affecting the convenience of the Committee, and that is the hours of sitting. It will be in the recollection of hon. Members that under the new Rules of Procedure we may sit while the House is in Session, and that is an indication it is expected we shall probably do so. There are two methods, and the most convenient appears to be to sit from 11 to 1, and then the Chairman, at an appropriate moment, will adjourn the Committee, which will meet again at 4 and possibly carry on until somewhere near 6 o'clock. I think it desirable that the Committee should indicate in some way what it wishes to do, and perhaps the Minister in charge of the Bill may give us his views upon it, and also inform us what may be for the convenience of the Government. I gather from conversations which I have had that probably the most convenient days will be Tuesdays and Thursdays. These are the favourite days, and, as this Committee has precedence, being the first to meet, I think we have a right to this Committee Room. With regard to the hours, I think we should take the opinion of the Committee whether from 11 to 1 and 4 to 6 will be convenient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should prefer that the morning sitting should be prolonged to 2 o'clock, and if we could start earlier in the day we might get our work finished in better time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope we shall adhere to the proposal of the Minister in charge and sit from 11 to 1, and, if necessary, from 4 to 6 cr 6.30. I under-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
stand that was the original arrangement, and I think it would meet the convenience of the Committee. I certainly think most Members desire to be present at Question Time in the House more than at any other time, and therefore I hope the suggestion of the Minister in charge will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir EDGAR JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot we go on until 1.30. It does not give us very long from 11 to 1, and very often so early a rising might prevent a decision being come to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be much better to have the morning sitting from 10.30 to 1.30?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member suggest we should meet at 10.30?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and finish at I. We could meet again in the afternoon if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PRESIDENT of the LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Dr. Addison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to press the point unduly, but hon. Members who hold office find that they are able in that extra half-hour to dispose of correspondence and various other matters, and it would be more convenient to me personally if we met at 11. But I do not want to urge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to save time I will move that we meet from 11 to I and again from 4 to 6, or 6.30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the pleasure of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Assent of Committee given</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then we shall meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 to 1, and again at 4 o'clock until about 6. That I gather to be the view of the Committee. Of course it is possible to change the arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it understood that Members will receive copies of the OFFICIAL REPORT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the arrangement. Before commencing our proceedings may I say I am very glad that the Minister in charge of the Bill is present. He is still suffering to some extent from his illness, and, if the Committee will kindly agree, he can speak while seated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(ESTABLISHMENT OF MINISTER.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>For the purpose of promoting the health of the people throughout England and Wales, and for the purpose of the exercise of the powers transferred or conferred by this Act, it shall be lawful for His Majesty to appoint a Minister of Health (hereinafter called "the Minister"), who shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure.</p>
	<p>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 2.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(General Powers and Duties of Minister in Relation to Health.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>It shall be the duty of the Minister to take all such steps as may be desirable to secure the effective carrying out and co-ordination of measures conducive to the health of the people, including measures for the prevention and cure of diseases, the treatment of physical and mental defects, the collection and preparation of information and statistics relating theàeto, and the training of persons engaged in health services.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major McMICKING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the beginning, to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"In respect to the powers hereby transferred or hereunder to be transferred to the Minister,"</p></blockquote>
Clause 2 of the Bill describes the general powers and duties of the Minister, and the object of my Amendment is to describe those powers with rather more precision. The powers to be transferred to the Minister, as set out in the Bill, are very wide indeed as will be gathered from the Paper which has been circulated to members of the Committee—"a Statement of the various Government Departments who at present administer health services, together with particulars as far as possible of the scope and limit of their functions." Wide though those powers may be they are nothing like so wide as the powers contained in Clause 2. So far as I can see under Clause 2 the Minister would have power to order people to be compulsorily inoculated, and to exercise various other powers, such as the closing of places of amusement and preventing people coming together in large numbers. In fact it appears to me that under Clause 2 it is very difficult to set any limit to the powers of the Ministry. I do not for one moment mean to suggest that the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board being given those powers, great though they may be, would exercise them in a harsh or unsympathetic or unwise manner, but we have to remember that Governments come and go, and it might be our fate in the future to have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
as Minister of Health a Minister who took a view of his duties, which for purposes of health would lead him to try and compel people to do things to which they very seriously object. Now this is not altogether imaginary, because we know that things of this description, such as the closing of places of meeting and preventing the people coming together in large numbers, have occurred lately in America. We were told on the Second Beading of the Bill that no additional powers were asked for by the Government, and that the underlying principle of the Bill was the co-ordination of existing powers coupled with unity of control. This small Amendment, and it is particularly only a drafting Amendment, is merely intended to bring Clause 2 into agreement with the principle of the Bill, and to state definitely that the powers of the Minister will be transferred powers. I hope my right hon. Friend will give favourable consideration to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and gallant Friend certainly raises a very important point on this Bill, and one on which the Committee should receive the guidance of the Minister as soon as possible. What we want to know is, are the powers of the Minister strictly limited to what I think is the verbal interpretation of Clause 2, or is the Minister to be allowed to enforce treatment and issue regulations, and to do acts for which, but for this Bill, he would have to come to Parliament for sanction? Is he to be allowed to compel people to submit to treatment which they are not legally bound to submit to now? Can he issue regulations such as the well-known Regulation 40D? I do not believe he can, and I venture to think that the words of Clause 2 limit his powers to carrying out and co-ordinating measures conducive to the health of the people. It all depends on the meaning of the word "measures." The words of the Clause are "The effective carrying out and co-ordination of measures." I take it the measures referred to are contained in the existing law and existing Statutes, that this power gives the Minister no authority to compel treatment that a man or woman is Hot obliged to submit to now, and that all it does is to put together under one Department and one administration powers which are now scattered, as we learn, over twenty or twenty-one different Departments".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Major Astor)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is entitled to know exactly the intentions of the Government as set out in Clause 2, and I welcome this Amendment as an opportunity of telling the Committee exactly what it is we have in mind. I am perfectly well aware that people have read Clause 2 and interpreted it in different manners. Some on one side hope that it will give the Minister new powers to do all sorts of new things. Others fear that it may give the Minister those powers. It is because there is that doubt as to the meaning of Clause 2 as now drafted that I welcome this opportunity of explaining what we have in mind. As there is some doubt in the Clause as now drafted it would be quite right that we should set it right by some verbal Amendment. There is no intention whatever on the part of my right hon. Friend to give or take, or to try to give or take any new powers. As was said by my hon. and gallant Friend (Major Hills) Clause 2 is governed by the word "co-ordination." The Clause says that it shall be the duty of the Minister in order to secure
	<br><blockquote><p>"the effective carrying out and co-ordination of measures conducive to the health of the people."</p></blockquote>
It merely shows the intention of the Government to transfer to one Department, under one Minister, existing powers. It does not give new powers, and it does not take away any existing powers; it merely leaves the law as it now stands. But it says that it is the intention, when the Ministry of Health Bill is passed, to transfer to the one Ministry existing powers, not more and not less. Perhaps I might at this stage deal with the further point that Clause 2 does not purport to set out all the powers which the Ministry of Health will have. At the end, by way of illustration of the sort of powers which will be transferred we have put in the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"including measures for the prevention and cure of diseases, the treatment of physical and mental defects."</p></blockquote>
That is merely by way of illustration. It does not pretend to exhaust or give a full detailed list of the powers to be transferred to the Ministry. Further—and this is a point which I had better explain straight away—it imposes upon the Minister the duty of taking a personal interest in matters appertaining to health which will not necessarily be transferred to him. For instance, take medical edu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
cation. It is proposad to leave all the powers, functions and duties connected with medical education where they now exist; not to transfer them to the Minister of Health, for reasons which I will explain later on. But the Clause imposes upon the Minister the duty of taking an interest in medical education. Obviously, he would do that in any case, but it merely says that Parliament expects him to continue to do as he has done in the past, namely, keep in touch with whoever it responsible for medical education. Perhaps I may explain a further point, namely, that the Minister really has not any power of doing things himself. As hon Members probably know, Parliament in the past has given certain powers to the local authorities—not to the Minister, not to the Local Government Board, not to a Central Board, but to the local authorities to do certain things—provide institutions, if you like—under the direction and control of the Minister. But it is not the Minister himself who does them. It is important that the Committee should bear that clearly in mind. It is not the Minister who has the powers now; he only directs, controls and supervises. We have not here a centralised bureaucracy. The whole principle is based on decentralisation and local administration. Parliament has conferred at different times and under different Acts certain powers on local authorities. It is for the local authorities to carry out those powers. I hope the Committee will bear that in mind, because various Amendments have been put down under a misapprehension and under the belief that the Minister now has power to do certain things, whereas it is the local authorities who have the powers, and not the Minister. My hon. and gallant Friend raised a very important point, that is the power of imposing a universal Regulation 40D. On behalf of my right hon. Friend, I want to say straight away that he has no intention whatever of doing anything like it. He has no power as Minister of Health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Bill does not touch the Defence of the Realm Acts. My right hon. Friend has absolutely no power whatever, as Minister of Health, any more than he has as President of the Local Government Board, to make such a Regulation as a compulsory 40D. What I have tried to explain to the Committee is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0007">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Clause 2 neither increases nor diminishes existing powers. If the Mover of this Amendment is prepared to withdraw it, on behalf of the Government I am prepared to accept the principle of the Amendment and to move immediately afterwards words which I understand convey exactly what he has in mind and which I am advised are in slightly better form. That Amendment will be to insert after the word "Minister" the words

I know that this is a very thorny subject, but there is a very strong feeling that the course proposed in my Amendment should be carried out. I understand that the Government have powers in this matter, but they seem never to have used them. There is a strong feeling in the House, in view of the new departures in Parliamentary Procedure, that it is proper that we should be ruled by Acts of Parliament rather than by bureaucracy and Orders in Council. All the existing powers have been tried, and we have seen the lamentable results in the military examination of the male population of this country. These are probably the most healthy islands in the world, yet we have only a C3 population. It is time we should make every effort to meet the greatest enemy with which the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
human race is faced. It would be a mistake, when we have brought in a Health Bill like this, that we should devote ourselves merely to mending machinery and side issues. We ought to attack this great enemy in front, and do the best we can for the existing generation and for the generations that are yet unborn. We have the old scriptural phrase that "blood is the life." This Amendment is really a fight for clean blood, in order to try to produce people who will carry on the great work of the British race as cleanly as they possibly can. In days gone by, and indeed until quite recently, matters of this sort were barred from conversation owing to a feeling of modesty. That feeling has been largely dissipated, for people have come to know in the last few years of the War a great deal more about the elementary forces of nature than they have ever done before, and the question of notification is well-known to the whole of the 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 men who have served in the Army. Now when a man goes into hospital for venereal disease it is put up at his regimental depot, "So-and-so in hospital, V.D.," and it is there for the public and all the people in his home district to see if they like. Therefore, in making this a notifiable disease we cannot say that we are doing anything which is in any way new. I contend that the health and the happiness of too many people are dependent upon this, and we should not shut ourselves out, through a feeling of false modesty, from discussing it. I do not go into details, I only lay down the principle that it ought to be done. If it ought to be done, hon. Members should ask themselves can it be done? If it can be done, how can it best be done? Once we have settled the principle, the details can follow afterwards. I am sure the Committee will exonerate me from any feelings of Pharisaism or sanctity in this matter. I do not bring this matter forward in any such spirit, but rather in the spirit of the good Samaritan, namely, that we should help an unfortunate brother or sister to the best of our ability. We are not here to preach morals to anybody. I am rather guided by the principle laid down by Our Saviour, who when a woman was caught in a fault, said
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let him that is without sin cast the first stone."</p></blockquote>
In advocating this, we do not wish to hold up an unfortunate or unfortunate sister to obloquy. A great many men know that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
they can thank God if they get on in life and escape the great misfortunes which have befallen people who have probably fallen away from grace. One man suffers all his life and produces children who never know what good health is. Another man who has erred in the same way escapes, and perhaps has the joy, of having healthy children. We ought to try to help these people who have the great misfortune to fall by the way and to suffer from following an ordinary desire, which after all, is a God-given instinct to enable the human race to carry on. I think it must be brought home to everyone that the doctrine of personal responsibility towards the whole race rests upon each individual citizen, whether a man or a woman. We have in some of our recent legislation specially appointed officers to meet special cases. We have an "Officer's Friend" in the Army, we now have a "Member's Friend" to listen to our troubles about demobilisation, and it should not be above the wit of man or the wit of this Committee to institute some department or some official who will be the "Sufferer's Friend," so that men in trouble in this way should be able to go to him and repose in him, in confidence, their misfortunes. There should be women doctors specially selected to treat their own sex in the same way. I consider that this is a question where a stitch in time is invaluable. If you treat a disease of this sort in the early stages, you may defeat it, and the citizen, having learnt wisdom, may become a happy and healthy member of society, and perhaps pass on a happy and healthy life to the children who follow; whereas if the disease is allowed to go on and eat into the human frame, as we know it does, then the person who suffers not only loses his or her own health and happiness, but can never rear healthy children. In that spirit I propose this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRIANT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that at the present time the Local Government Board has powers to make notifiable any infectious or contagious disease, I think by Order in Council, if I remember rightly; but, apart from that; I do urge that it is a very dangerous course to make this notifiable. Anyone associated with social work will know that the greatest difficulty is that men and women suffering from this disease dread any publicity. All the measures so far taken to deal with this disease have been based, and rightly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
based, on the desire to allow men and women to believe that when they go for treatment the treatment is absolutely private. The moment a man believes it will be notifiable he begins to associate with it some degree of publicity, and he feels that his treatment may become known publicly more or less, or, at any rate, that it will be known to the Medical Officer of Health, and therefore that the knowledge will be accessible to other people. The danger will be that people will not go in for treatment at all, but will resort to quacks, who in the past have been such an enormous danger to the State. Unfortunately, having had to deal with some of these cases, I believe that by making the disease notifiable it would in the end lead to a reduced number of persons applying for treatment. I allow that it is a very difficult question, but, taking it as a whole, I can say, as one who has unfortunately had to do with some of the men, that the greatest difficulty in getting them to apply for treatment is owing to their fear that someone will know anything about it, and the moment they know it is to be a notifiable disease I am afraid they will refuse to go for treatment. Even if it is desirable, I do not believe that any further Clause is necessary in this Bill, as I believe the Local Government Board has already the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this point I may say that the Local Government Board already has powers, if it so desire, to make this disease compulsorily notifiable, but the considerations advanced by my hon. Friend are of very great importance. As a matter of fact, the problem at the present time is to provide a sufficient number of early treatment centres. Some two or three weeks ago I appointed my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and others, in conjunction with the War Office, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, to take steps in concert to try to prevent the spread of these diseases in connection with demobilisation. But I may say that, whichever way we approach this question it is clear that the governing consideration is facilities for proper treatment under such conditions that the patients will readily go and make use of them. That is the thing which has got to be provided first, and I am afraid that there is overwhelming evidence that any wholesale adoption of compulsory notification might keep a large number of persons
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
from getting early treatment, which is the very thing of all others we want to encourage, and it is the stage of the disease where treatment is most efficacious and easiest. Therefore, for two reasons—not that I do not entirely agree with everything my hon. Friend said as to the vast importance of taking much more energetic steps than we have done hitherto to treat these diseases, and not out of any want of sympathy with the object of his Amendment, but because, first, we have power to do it now if necessary, and because I do not think that it is the wisest and most rapid way of proceeding to make it here and now compulsorily notifiable under any and every circumstances, I would much rather the hon. Member would trust us and keep us stirred up to make a fuller and better use of the powers we have got, which are quite adequate, if we can get the necessary staff and the necessary treatment centres set up all through the country. At the present time, I believe, there are about 140. We need 1,000 That is the problem, and I do not think it would be advanced by introducing these words here.

May I also add a word on the general purpose of Clause 2? It is really declaratory. It does not confer additional powers, and I would suggest that if we were to recite in the Clause all the different activities which it would be desirable that the Minister of Health should exercise, we should embark upon the compilation of a very big catalogue, and we should find that Clause 2 would run over to the next page. I do not mind saying that in the first draft of the Bill that I submitted, this Clause was not in at all, because we saw that, once we started on compiling a catalogue, we might let ourselves in for a very portentous accumulation of desirable statements. However, it was felt that it would be useful if some general statement of intention were made, and that was all that the Clause was meant to provide. Therefore, I hope—and this remark applies to soma other Amendment—that, as far as possible, the Committee will desist from pressing us to add a number of statements of intention to Clause 2, because they do not add to the powers of the Ministry, and I am afraid that we should find that we had left out even then things which it was desirable to put in. It is better, I think, to leave it in a general way, indicating the wide purposes and intentions of Parliament in set-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
ting up this Ministry, rather than attempting to set out in a detailed statement a complete summary of the activities which it might be called upon to exercise. On these grounds—as this Amendment would be the first of many Amendments—I hope the Committee will not press us to accept it, and I may say, in addition, that it is not necessary, because we have already the powers referred to here. Therefore, I am sorry I do not feel able to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. SHAW</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to a statement made by the hon. Member who introduced the Amendment—a statement which I believe to be inaccurate, and which might convey a wrong impression. The statement was that we had a C3 population, and the implication was that the C3 population was due to the prevalence of venereal disease. It fell to my lot during the War to have something to do with the getting of men for the Army. I have seen a compilation of statistics covering a quarter of a million examinations, roughly, from five counties in England, and I believe that the statement that venereal disease has played such a large part in the deterioration of our population is absolutely wrong. The examinations did not show that to be the fact, and I am quite satisfied that the C 3 population is due to other conditions. I wanted to make that statement because I would not like the Committee to run away with the idea that venereal disease is responsible for so great a proportion of our physical deterioration as is generally assumed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman persist in his Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped to get a little more support for my Amendment. I would like to say to the last speaker that I did not make that statement he accused me of making. I said all the powers had been exhausted and yet we had got a C 3 population. I disagree with him—and I think many who know about these things will disagree with him—when he minimises the effect on our population of this terrible malady, and I am in a position to say that since the Armistice it has increased very considerably. However, I do not want to put the Committee to the trouble of a Division unless I am supported. My seconder is not on the Committee, so I really have not a seconder for the Amendment, but I shall be quite prepared to

put my own vote in as a matter of protest, though I do not want to delay the Committee. I am not at all convinced by what the Minister in charge of the Bill has told us, and I do not see that anything I have asked for will hurt him in any way. He says he has 140 centres and we are dependent on the good will of the office, and so on. I am expressing the feeling of many Members when I say that Parliament would be better to do its own business than to push it on to Departments and leave it to its representatives, who may be good men, but whose successors may not be so efficient. However, as the Committee does not back me up, I am prepared to withdraw the Amendment in the hope that all the good wishes of the right hon. Gentleman will be carried out. If backed up at all I should certainly take it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain BARNETT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the word "including," and to insert instead thereof the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to spread information about diet and hygiene and to promote.'</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this Amendment is to make explicit what is possibly implicit in the Clause as drafted, namely, the right and duty of the Ministry of Health to undertake matters of propaganda in regard to diet and hygiene. After what has fallen from the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill, I realise that we cannot hope in this Clause to define everything that the Ministry is supposed to do, but I venture to think that propaganda is so important that there ought to be an explicit statement in this Clause that it is the duty of the Ministry of Health to carry it out. Take the malnutrition of infants, for example. I believe that the feeding of infants on bottled stout is condemned by the medical profession; all the same, the practice exists, and it is due to ignorance. I speak with a certain amount of diffidence in the presence of so many members of the medical profession, but I believe it is widely held that the virulence of this epidemic we have had amongst us recently is very largely due to the need of a proper diet. It seems to me that it is very desirable it should be clearly stated in the Bill that it is the duty of the Ministry of Health to make known information about diet and hygiene. I hope that my right hon. Friend may see his way to accept this very modest Amendment. I do not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
think it interferes with anything that he has said about the undesirability of overloading the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree with the Mover of this Amendment that the spread of such information as he has indicated would be most useful, and would be one of the first duties of the Ministry, but I think it would be very unwise to put in a Bill of this size a Clause setting out all the duties of the Ministry. It is quite obvious that propaganda is one of the very first things which the Ministry will have to do. We hope to do a great deal, and we are already trying to do a great deal. The Committee, for instance, has had an interesting discussion in connection with venereal disease. One of the best ways of dealing with venereal disease is publicity and information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are giving grants or it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are doing that. I am perfectly certain that there is a growing feeling in this country that one of the best ways of dealing with disease or disease conditions is by information and improved conditions. That is by way of prevention. So far as I can make out, the Mover of this Amendment proposes that we should suggest to people that if they are well fed and well nourished they are less liable, for instance, to catch influenza. If he will read the circular issued recently by the Local Government Board he will find that that particular point was emphasised. We are, in fact, already doing what he wants us to do. We are trying to educate the public so that the general welfare of the community as a whole may be increased and improved. If we once start inserting a number of illustrations in Clause 2, there is no reason why we should not have a long list. There are others as important and more important than the illustration given by the hon. Member. Later on, there is an amendment as to the preparation of information and statistics. That is really the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain BARNETT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hardly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of opinion, but the giving of information is really what the hon. Member has in mind. We propose to amend the particular words in the Clause later on by meeting the Mover of the Amendment. We are giving

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
evidence of our activity in the particular direction desired by this Amendment, and I cannot ask the Committee to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. MURRAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with a personal point? I have just returned from France where I have been acting as president of a civilian advisory board, consulting with the officers and the men regarding their duties when they return from France. At a certain town we were visited by certain doctors and certain orderlies from a venereal hospital. The doctors came to enforce the views of the men. The men's point was, that having been indoctrinated in the work of venereal disease, they desired to have an opportunity of working in clinics, and also—and this was their special point—of continuing in ways best known to themselves, they being working men, propaganda amongst the working classes against this disease. The point appeared to me to be very important, and I undertook to do what I could when I got home to ventilate the matter. While supporting in principle the Amendment now proposed I would be satisfied if I could get from the Minister a word stating that such propaganda for which these men might be used is contemplated under this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may say on that, that we have in fact taken steps within the last month to assist propaganda in connection with venereal disease. We have contributed towards the expense of a propaganda campaign by the National Council by giving them a large Grant, and they are conducting lectures and so forth, and the men to whom the hon. Member (Mr. Murray) refers are, I know, being freely employed in that way. Of course, we have to be careful whom we employ to carry on propaganda on these very ticklish subjects, and we have to be very careful how we make any grants, in order to secure that the money is wisely and sensibly utilised. We have contributed within the last two months £8,000 towards the expense of propaganda of a sensible and practical kind in this particular connection and allied matters. Therefore, we have given proof that we are trying to do what the hon. Member wants. We propose, later on, to accept an Amendment moved by one hon. Member (Mr. Godfrey Locker-Lampson) with regard to publication which makes it very clear that it is publicity that is wanted. That would cover the point of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
food and every form of publicity which may be material. I think that would meet the Mover of this Amendment (Captain Barnett). As we have shown that we are ready to encourage propaganda work, it would be inadvisable to specify the particular forms of propaganda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment (in the names of Mr. Swan, Mr. Sitch, and Mr. Thomas) which relates to the establishment of national hospitals and other institutions for the treatment of the sick and disabled, and the nationalisation of existing institutions dependent upon voluntary contributions for their maintenance, is out of order. The Clause does not seek to confer new powers as this Amendment does. Therefore the Amendment should be put down as a new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major FARQUHARSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the word "and" ["prevention and cure"], and to insert after the word "cure" the words "and scientific investigation."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite in sympathy with what the President of the Local Government Board and the Parliamentary Secretary have said in regard to the undesirability of introducing a whole list of faculties or functions allotted to the new Ministry within this Clause. I also accept unreservedly the expression of the Local Government Board's intentions in this matter, but I would remind them that the intention and the effect of an Act of Parliament are often very widely divergent. Ministers come and Ministers go; Governments come and Governments go, but the Statute remains, and only within the words of the Statute are the successors in office to be bound and their wider views defined. I hope the Government will acept this Amendment, because the phrase is a very wide one. I have heard with great pleasure the statement that £8,000 have been granted recently for publicity work. My point is, that as the Clause is framed, no matter with what good desires the Minister of Health might wish to give Grants-in-Aid to scientific work, you might have a very hard-hearted Auditor-General who would say "No, it is not within the Statute for you to have anything to do with scientific investigation or scientific work, and therefore I cannot allow you to spend money in this way." That view gets added force when you remember that there is an ex-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as we are concerned, we have no objection to the whole question being discussed now, and if the Committee agrees to that I think there is a great deal to be said for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member (Major Hills) has said, and I feel some diffidence in referring to the matter. I only referred to the Medical Research Committee insofar as its prospective functions affect my Amendment. If you take away from the Ministry of Health the power to initiate, direct or control Medical Research, you must surely allow that the Ministry of Health must have some power somewhere. If it has not the power to direct Medical Research through the Medical Research Committee, then it must have power to do it through its own Department. There is nothing, to my mind, in the Statute which empowers the Ministry of Health to deal with this. I know what the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
intention is, and I know the Local Government Board are doing all sorts of research work now, but I am particularly anxious that the Ministry of Health shall have a wider view. There are numerous young men leaving the medical schools with such a training in science and scientific matters as we of the older generation never had the faintest idea of. Will the Ministry of Health have power to assist those men who do not necessarily find themselves in the laboratories, but who are really at work in the profession and who wish to keep up their scientific knowledge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K.

I am sure that would be more advantageous to the Committee It certainly would give us an opportunity of discussing the whole matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment standing in the name of Mr. Godfrey Locker-Lampson—[to insert the words "the subsidy of the labour of consumptives or ex-consumptives"]—is out of order for the same reason as the Amendment preceding.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G.

My Amendment merely concerns part of the treatment of consumptives who come under the existing services, and after what my right hon. Friend has said I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee, and I shall be quite satisfied if he can give me an assurance that he has got this matter in mind and will really do something for the safety of these consumptives and ex-consumptives. There is a Bill now before the French Chamber dealing with this very point, and they are going to give an annual subsidy of four millions a year with foundation charges of about three and a half million, a large part of which is going to be used for this very purpose. A very high authority, Sir Robert Morant, stated the other day that he very much agreed with what I am agitating in the present Amendment. I do not want to press this Amendment if my right hon. Friend assures me that the Government really intends to do what they can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend thoroughly realises the importance of dealing with consumptives, whether civilians or ex-soldiers. He himself is interested in it, as is also the Minister of Pensions and many others. In fact it is a matter which the Government have very much at heart. It may interest the Committee to know that my right hon. Friend has set up one Committee and is, at the moment, setting up another, to look at the different aspects of this important question, and, as I said downstairs, we do not at all want hon. Members who are interested in this subject to believe that in our opinion the present organisation is satisfactory or adequate. We want more to be done, and we are anxious to develop the very form of assistance my hon. Friend has in mind, and it is in order to do this to the best advantage and in the most economical manner, and to get the experience of those who have experience, that my right hon. Friend is proposing to go into it in person, as I am also doing on his behalf. With that assurance, I do not want to go at great length into exactly what our proposals are. That is a general matter of policy, and is not really connected with this Bill. I hope our hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment, since we realise that more has got to be done, both as regards civilians and ex-soldiers, and it is particularly the latter for whom the new Committee is being set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and the training of persons engaged in health services."</p></blockquote>
At first it might appear that I am desirous of lessening the powers of the Minister of Health, but I am really desirous of increasing them to some extent. My first reason for moving this Amendment is that I do not clearly understand what the words are intended to convey. I do not know whether they mean the training of persons already engaged in health services or of those who will be so engaged. If the-former, it seems that training will come a little too late because they should be trained before they are engaged. The Clause as it stands seems to mean nothing, in which case it should be omitted; or else it means a great deal more than is the intention of the Minister, and in that case it ought to be altered. The Minister in charge of the Bill has already said that it is the intention of the new Ministry, as it was in the Act of the Local Government Board, to take some interest in the education of persons who are likely to be engaged on health services. There is nothing that I can see in the Bill itself which would prevent a Minister in charge from taking an interest in health services. Any interest which the Minister of Health may take in matters relating to the training of such persons would, of course, be willingly accepted by those engaged in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
such training. It certainly does not need a Clause of this kind to give power to the Minister to take an interest in the training of persons engaged in health services. The Clause itself refers to the power of prevention of disease and everything relating to health, and, therefore, it might be interpreted to mean that the Minister of Health would have the power of interfering in all arrangements that are at present made for the training of persons for the medical profession or of officers of hygiene, or in any other capacity connected with health service. That is to say, the Minister of Health, if not placed in charge of, would certainly have the power of interfering with, the courses of instruction in our medical schools attached to hospitals, as well as those attached to universities. I do not think that this can be intended. Therefore the words should be omitted altogether, which seems to me to be desirable or so much better defined as to prevent them meaning a great deal more than is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intentions of a Minister cannot be inserted in a Bill because the Minister changes from time to time, and the Government changes. Therefore it is most desirable, unless the interpretation of the Bill is to be entirely in the hands of lawyers, to have the intention expressed definitely in the Clause itself. I cannot see the object which is obtained by the insertion of these words. I think it very desirable that the Minister of Health shall take a general interest in all education connected with health service, but that is a very different thing from saying that he shall co-ordinate measures for the training of persons engaged in such services. I think that the blessed word "co-ordination" in this case covers a little more than is intended by the Minister. In this particular instance, it certainly would involve the possibility of the Minister saying that courses of instruction given in King's College, University College, and Middlesex Hospital were given in the same subjects, and should be discontinued because, to co-ordinate them, they should all be given at one centre. That would be giving a power to the Ministry which would be very undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before dealing with the general points raised by my hon. Friend, I would like to say that we propose to move an Amendment in the last line, to omit the words "engaged in" and insert the word "for." This will clear off one of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
the points which he has put by way of question. Clause 2 attempts to put on paper the sort of things which the Minister of Health will be expected to do. He will be expected to co-ordinate the powers which the Bill will transfer to him or proposes may be transferred to him at some future time. One or two illustrations are given in Clause 2 of the sort of things which may be transferred to him but, by way of illustration and as explaining what, I believe, is in mind at the moment, and certainly also by way of illustration of what his duties will be, these words were put in in order to show that it was intended that he should keep in touch with such other departments or bodies as may deal with the matter which the hon. Member has put before us. There is no intention implied or expressed—and if the hon. Member will look through the Clause he will see that it is not proposed—to transfer the functions of the General Medical Council or any of the functions of the President of the Board of Education in connection with Grants to universities and schools. This merely shows that, when the Ministry is set up, it is hoped that it will keep in touch with the other bodies that are dealing with these matters. I do not think that there is anything endangering the training of the medical profession in the Clause as now drafted. I hope my hon. Friend will withdraw his Amendment, so that I may move the slight verbal alteration which we propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This deals purely with training and educational matters. The function of veterinary surgeons in connection with the administration of Acts of Parliament is an important measure which will arise when we are considering what would be the extension of the health services, but is quite a separate matter from the functions of the central Department.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are so many big questions of health administration in connection with milk and many other matters, which I think would be properly dealt with when we have specific proposals, which we shall have in the near future, put before Parliament in connection with the development of our various health services that I do not think I could usefully say anything on the general question raised here. This relates merely to the duties of the Ministry in taking cognisance of training. I am in thorough sympathy with the general purpose of the hon. Member, but if once we embark on discussing individual health services and their local administration we shall get outside the intention of this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I consider the explanation of the hon. Member altogether satisfactory. I quite admit that the alteration that has been made in the Clause would prevent the Minister interfering with any powers or duties which are not transferred to him, but it does seem to me that these words are rather in contradiction to the words which the Minister in charge has already chosen to insert in the Bill. If it said that he shall have the power of taking cognisance of the training given to persons engaged in health service, I should have thought it a very reasonable thing to do. I am not prepared to divide the Committee on this question, but I would suggest that the Minister should consider this a little more fully before we come to the Report stage with a view to seeing whether these words cannot be further altered so as to make them coincide with the first words in this Clause, and also so as to prevent the possibility of his interfering with duties which are not transferred to him. In the circumstances I will withdraw the Amendment for the present, but shall feel at liberty to raise it again on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

never come within the powers of the Minister of Health. I cannot accept that attitude at all. I heartily support what the hon. Member for London University has said. The mere exclusion of any one from an Act of Parliament does not limit the effect of these words. I accept the suggestion that all this Clause is merely for the purpose of illustration which we ought to look at this from a point of view other than that of a picture show. We must have effective words so that people administering this in years to come can say, "those people knew something about what they tried to do." I do really think that this Clause is a most imperfect piece of framing, and we do not know where we are about it. I suggest that the Amendment as it now stands by the Government is not nearly such a good Amendment as the Statute stood before, because there it is limited to the training of persons already engaged. We know that there are a great many people in the health services already, visitors and under sanitary inspectors and so on, and they have a certain limited form of training. I suggest with this Amendment it is well within the Ministry's purpose to take those partially trained people and train them. Further, as it now stands the Government could arrange, apart from all business of transfer of power from any other Government Department, and even establish State medical service and send students to universities just as teachers are sent. This alteration not only makes the thing worse but it opens up all sorts of possibilities, which I am certain would lead to very great conflict in the future. I am strongly opposed to the alteration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. and gallant Friend is under a misapprehension. The meaning of the Amendment is simply this.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
merely a recital of the transfer of the powers, and I think he will see that his argument has very little force in it. Let me remind the Committee that there can be no misapprehension as to the position of the medical profession in relation to this matter. Unless the power of training medical men which now exists in another Department is actually transferred by this Bill it must obviously remain where it is at present. Therefore, I cannot understand—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the meaning of these words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The meaning of these words is to give an indication of the scope of the Ministry so far as this is concerned. The very reason why these words were inserted after a good deal of consultation with the different people interested was simply this, that a large number of the local authorities and friendly societies and approved societies attach the very greatest importance to the fact that in the future more attention will be paid to the training of people in health services, particularly people like sick visitors. This is only an endeavour in this Clause to pick out what are the more important things which are before the country at the present time, with the view to emphasising them, and it will give a great deal of disappointment if there is any question of refusing this Amendment or suggesting that these words will come out. I am sure that the medical members of this Committee will consider that they need not be under the slightest misapprehension in any way as to the question of the education of medical men. That is not affected in the slightest degree by this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the view put by my hon. and gallant Friend opposite.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
why I venture to make the suggestion that the whole of this illustrative but very misleading action should have been excluded altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an Amendment on the Paper in the name of the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Locker-Lampson) and I am in a little doubt as to whether it is in order, and whether it extends the powers and duties of the Ministry or not, so that perhaps the hon. Member will explain what he means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment of which I have given notice is to add at the end of the Clause the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to provide for the distribution, under such conditions as he may specify, of such sums as may be voted by Parliament to assist local authorities or other bodies (including voluntary hospitals) or persons in promoting the health of the people: provided that, if such local authorities or any of them do not within a reasonable time avail themselves of such sums or any portion of them the Minister may distribute or utilise such sums or any portion of them as he may think fit."</p></blockquote>
I set very great store by this Amendment and I very much hope I shall have the sympathy of the Committee for it. I am quite prepared to move it in an alternative form so as to bring it quite strictly within your ruling. What I feel about it is that the Government have really not got sufficient powers under this Bill to deal with the local authorities. They are really taking over the existing powers. I am not going to suggest that they have extra statutory powers. What is happening is that the Health Ministry is merely a new body by name to which the local authorities will have to refer. What my Amendment does is to suggest in the latter part of it, which I take it is in order, that supposing the local authorities refuse to expend the Grants that are made to them out of moneys provided by Parliament that the Minister shall be able to expend those Grants himself. That does not add, as far as I can see, any new statutory power. Of course, if you say that it does add some new power I have got a new Clause which covers practically the same ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end, to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that nothing in this section shall compel any person to receive treatment who makes?. statutory declaration that upon conscientious grounds he objects to medical treatment."</p></blockquote>
This, as the Committee will see, raises a very important point, and that is, ought you to allow persons who, for any ground, reasonable or unreasonable, object to medical treatment, the power to enforce their objection, or ought you to compel the whole community to accept the medical treatment to which certain Members may object? The view I put before the Committee if that the only way in which you can work an Act of this sort is to give a contracting-out Clause. I believe if you do not you will meet with large sections of the population who for one reason or another, perhaps they may be very obstinate and wrong-headed people, will object to medical treatment. It would be a great disaster if an Act of this sort, which I most cordially support, and for which I have worked for years, should break down on a question of this sort. After all, in a free country, you cannot in the end compel people to do what they do not want to do. If they do not want to receive special forms of treatment no Act of Parliament will make them. Take the case of the Vaccination Acts. In my judgment there were no measures more clearly justified on medical and on social grounds than the Vaccination Acts. I know I am speaking of what is not general agreement, but still I believe there were no measures that had a better or more beneficial effect on the health of this country. Yet before conscientious objection was allowed you had local authorities refusing to enforce the Acts and you had local authorities returned on the sole issue as to whether the Act should be enforced or not, and you got a narrower ambit of the Act as a result of that. I put this to the Committee that, if you want the Act to succeed, and we all do, you will be doing a very beneficial thing if from the very start you say to people who sincerely believe that for some reason or other, medical or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
religious, they object to treatment, "The State will not compel you." I am perfectly certain that you cannot compel a person to receive treatment if he prefers to go to prison rather than receive it, and I believe we shall be doing the very wisest thing in introducing this Amendment. As to the wording of it, I am not quite sure that I do not prefer that which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Leicester (Mr. F. Green), because it seems to me to be rather wider, but the principle is the same, and if we can get some assurance from the Government as to the acceptance of the principle the adjustment of the words ought not to be difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say on this that with the general political doctrines of the hon. and learned Gentleman I entirely agree. I agree with him with the temper of our fellow countrymen and countrywomen, and our experiences in the past show it quite well, that you cannot force treatment on people that they do not wish to accept. That is quite obvious, and I would be the last person in the world to try and do so. But it is quite a different thing from putting in a proviso of this kind in this Act. For instance, take the simple case of infectious fevers. At the present time diphtheria is compulsorily notifiable, and the community has said for its own protection that people suffering from certain infectious diseases, such as scarlet fever or diphtheria, must be isolated. Isolation is a preventive treatment so far as other people are concerned, but that isolation certainly carries with it in fever hospitals treatment for the patient. I am advised that if we were to accept an Amendment of this kind, and at this place, it would cut right across our powers with respect to infectious fevers. I am sure my hon. and learned Friend does not want to do that any more than I do. I would be the last man, knowing how futile it is, to try and force treatment upon unwilling persons, but sometimes the community, as in the case of infectious fevers, and there may be others arise in connection with demobilisation, has to take certain steps for its own protection, and we do not want to deprive ourselves of that elementary right by any words of this kind. Then also I would hark back to the statement of my hon. Friend that the words here do not give any added powers to the Minister, and the Minister has no power now to force treatment on unwilling
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
persons and he does not get any more powers by this Clause. Therefore there is no necessity to put into words the safeguarding phrases. They are unnecessary, because these powers under the Act are powers which are not transferred under this Bill. In the first place the words are unnecessary, and in the next place they might create grave misapprehension in respect to the treatment of infectious fevers. While I deprecate the insertion of these words, I can assure my hon. Friend that, although we do not want to put these words into the Bill, we shall expect to be carefully kept up to our promises. We do not want to obtain powers which we do not now possess to force on anybody some form of treatment which they do not want. If we should seek these powers we would have to come to Parliament and obtain them specifically.

WARREN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I do not desire in any way to affect the progress of this great measure, and, I think, there is no Member of this Committee who would wish to do so, I do not want to create new compulsory functions, and I am sure the President of the Local Government Board will have regard to that view in considering this matter. I. was profoundly impressed by a statement which he made a little time ago at a great meeting where he stated that there was to be as little compulsion as possible, or rather that there was to be no compulsion in respect to the Ministry of Health. I happened to be present and congratulated him upon that statement. We are all aware that there is a great deal of irritation at present existing in this country owing to the spread of compulsory powers, and it has led to a great deal of disquiet. We are anxious, as I am sure he is, that every person should have right and just treatment, and that they should be protected under this measure in getting the treatment they desire. I am not in favour of allowing a person suffering from infectious disease to run amok or to go on their own sweet will at their own volition, but there is a large number of persons who have what we may call conscientious scruples and other forms of objection to the enforcement of particular kinds of treatment. May I say, wíth great respect, as a layman, that such people do not always like to take a bottle of doctor's medicine. These people might not always
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
be satisfied with the treatment that might be given to them, and they might raise difficulties with respect to the exercise of new compulsory powers under the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not really satisfied that there is not a great case for this Amendment. There are none of us who would like to see persons going about suffering from infectious disease, and you must segregate them, but that is already provided for. But the question is when you have got a person who is suffering in that way are you to do as you like with him? Is he to be allowed to choose his own treatment, or will you force a particular kind of treatment upon him, although he may object to it? I am not quite certain that we have got the most apt words before us, but I do appeal very earnestly for consideration towards the scruples of a considerable number of people against a compulsory form of treatment. I should regard it as a great misfortune if we did anything to disturb the minds of these people and increase their objections. The President of the Local Government Board has spoken of his powers over people suffering from infectious disease, but we want to be certain that these promises bind not only him, but also by future Presidents of the Boards will be observed. I should like him to give us an assurance that between now and the Report stage, if it cannot be done now, he will consider the matter so as to propose words which will meet the points raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

raised our difficulties will be increased. There are a certain number of peculiar people and cranks, but if we are to provide for all these the measure will become chaotic. A great deal of the objection is purely sentimental, and I do not think that we should allow ourselves, out of sympathy with an Amendment like this, to impair the efficiency of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P.

I do not think there is any power given under the Bill to compel any person to accept any treatment that is not already in existence, and in order to deal with the case of conscientious objections it is not necessary to insert those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir COURTENAY WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this would be a great blot on the Bill. It would tend to a weakening of its powers, and I hope, therefore, that the Amendment will not be accepted either here or in the Report stage. In my opinion it is not necessary. There is not the least danger of anybody being treated compulsorily. I do not think the Minister has power to do that, and it would, I repeat, be a weakening of the Clause in the case of certain things which may have to be done in the future. Under the Instructions given in this Clause I may point out that in the case of venereal disease we should have to insist upon compulsory notification, and if we are going to insist upon it we are going to weaken this Bill by giving the conscientious objector power to object to medical treatment. It means that possibly at some future date, which may not be very far off, a case of this kind would occur when a person would object to being treated and such a Clause as this would then come in.

	<p>hon. Friends have put to me. I think there is power here to give treatment against a man's will. Let me take an extreme case. Suppose the President of the Local Government Board was to make venereal disease notifiable. That would mean he would have to segregate the people, and as a matter of course it would follow they would have to be treated. [HON. MEMBERS: "No, no!"] Yes; it may be so. The power is there whether it is exercised or not, and that is the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for the London University. I think the Government would gain a great deal and lose very little if they adopted a course of this sort. It is the principle I want to secure, and if I get it it will enormously help the passing of this Bill.</p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) all the powers and duties of the Secretary of State under the Lunacy Acts, 1890 to 1911, and the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913."</p></blockquote>
As the Bill stands, these powers can be transferred in the future under the second part of Clause 3, but they are not transferred at once. At present all lunatics and mentally deficient persons are under the Home Office, who act through Boards of Control. It will be quite easy to transfer the control of these persons to the new Ministry of Health. No administrative difficulties are involved, because it is a self-contained service, and could be transferred quite easily. From the administrative point of view, therefore, I see no objection to the transfer. But my real reason for asking the Committee to make this Amendment is on the medical side. I want all cases of lunacy and mental deficiency to be treated first of all as medical cases. In the far past they were not, but all the tendency of medical science—I speak in the presence of many doctors—has been to treat these unfortunate people as medical and curable cases as time goes on. The only chance of getting linked up to the general medical service of the country is to transfer their control at once to the Minister of Health. I do not see what is gained by delay. The fact that these persons are included in powers that may be transferred shows that their transfer has been contemplated, and if it is in contemplation, it seems to me that it is best to do it at once. In fact, their transfer is indicated in Clause 2, which we have just passed, for Clause 2 expressly empowers the Minister to provide for the treatment of physical and mental defects. It is, therefore, quite an easy transfer to carry out administratively, and it has great medical advantages. I therefore urge it most strongly on my right hon. Friend. I beg to move it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case for the immediate transfer of mentally deficient persons and others affected in a similar manner from their present suzerainty to that of the Minister of Health was made very powerfully during the Debate on the Second Reading. As I said then, my right hon. Friend the President of the Local Government Board and I were very much impressed by the facts put forward. They were not new facts, and we were not, either on that occasion or previously, nor are we now, unsympathetic to the proposal. But I should like to point out to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
my hon. and gallant Friend that by his Amendment he proposes to transfer "all the powers and duties" of the Secretary of State, whereas in the Bill it is proposed to transfer "all or any of the powers and duties." I am perfectly certain that one who, like himself, has studied the question of lunacy and mental deficiency, will know that there is not only the medical side to be considered. There is another side which has to to be very carefully borne in mind, and I think it would be contrary to the intention of Parliament, as expressed by the House of Commons on, at least, two previous occasions, that all of the powers and functions which are now under the Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor should be transferred to the Ministry of Health. I think that would be contrary to the intention of the House of Commons as expressed on, I think, two occasions when it went very fully into the whole question, and it is for this reason that, in preparing the Bill, the words "all or any" were inserted. I may say that in addition to the conversations which my right hon. Friend has had with other Ministers, I have myself seen the Home Secretary. He is not at all unwilling that the transfer should take place, and would not oppose it. But that is the suggested transfer as proposed in our Bill, which is quite different from the proposal contained in my hon. and gallant Friend's Amendment, namely, that all the functions and duties, whether they are medical or judicial, whether they affect the liberty of the subject, and the other functions and duties which for very good reasons were put under the Lord Chancellor or under the Home Office in the past, shall be transferred. I am perfectly convinced that the Home Secretary would not wish to transfer all these functions and powers to the Ministry of Health. I do not believe that that would be in accord with the intentions of Parliament, when the case was so fully placed before Parliament. Our intention was that these duties and powers should be transferred as soon as convenient. The negotiations and the discussion of the various functions have not been quite completed. Hon. Members will realise that when you come to intricate points affecting the liberty of the subject and the medical treatment of people who have been expressly committed to the charge of Ministers and of independent persons in order to protect them, it is very necessary to go warily, to be sure

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
that we do not act against what has been the considered policy in the past. That is one of the reasons why this particular proposal as affecting mental defectives was put among the powers which should be transferred but which were not transferred at the present moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is another point. I am perfectly certain that all who have followed this Bill closely, and all who hope for a great deal from it in the future, realise the magnitude of the task which we have in hand—the enormous problems with which we have to deal. The development of the maternity service—that is one of the most urgent—the whole medical services as affecting the population generally; the problem of dealing with tubercle on a more satisfactory scale and in a more satisfactory manner than at present; the question of dealing with venereal disease; in addition to all this we have the whole of the housing question to deal with in the next few months. That is why it was felt that we ought not to try and undertake too much at the moment when the Ministry was first set up. I therefore suggest to the Committee that my hon. and learned Friend should not press his Amendment. I will give an undertaking on behalf of the President—I was going to say that he will at once initiate discussions with the Home Office for the transfer of such powers as can be transferred, but I will not say that because the matter is already being discussed with them; I will say that it will be proceeded with and that no time will be lost. I do not want to disappoint my hon. and learned Friend or any other members of the Committee by saying that they ought, in our opinion, to be transferred immediately or that they can be transferred in a month's time. Let us do what we have set out to do—to build the foundation of the essential services; and as soon as we have finished that, the intricate and delicate operation of dissection as between the functions which ought properly to come under the Minister of Health and those which ought properly to remain under the Home Office, can be undertaken. I can assure members of the Committee that we will lose no time, because it is our desire to meet the wishes of my hon. Friend as expressed on the Second Beading of the Bill, but not quite as expressed in the wording of this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"except as relating to the administration of the Poor Law, which administration shall be transferred to the Home Office."</p></blockquote>
I am raising in this Amendment what I am sure will be regarded as a question of principle affecting the Ministry of Health. It will be within the recollection of the members of this Committee that this matter of the Ministry of Health has been before us for some considerable period, probably some two or three years. In the early days of the discussion with regard to the Ministry of Health I think it was generally assumed that the Ministry would be a new structure, something separate and apart from any existing Government Department. I know that was in the minds of a large number of the members of the friendly societies throughout the country, for whom I speak, and who number some six or seven millions. In their discussions and deliberations they always regarded the Ministry as being a new structure, into which would be brought the health services of the country. In the course of the negotiations and deliberations that have taken place the Ministry has now passed—or it is proposed that it should pass—to the Local Government Board and the name "Local Government Board" is to pass away. The odour of the Local Government Board, in the judgment of many people, will still hang around the Ministry of Health if it retains certain features which have been objectionable to the thrifty, careful, thoughtful, provident, independent men and women of this country. I would point out that the great friendly society movement in this country came into existence more than 110 years back for the purpose of defeating the then Poor Law of the country. The friendly societies were formed because men and women said they would not take the dole of pauperism; they would not be contaminated by contact with Poor Law administration. They would endeavour to give evidence of self-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
dependence and thrift and thoughtfulness, and to provide for themselves against a rainy day. That great thrift movement has always been strongly antagonistic to the Poor Law administration and to the aspect of pauperism as presented by the Local Government Board. In the transfer of the Local Government Board under another name to the Ministry of Health, it is proposed that many of the Local Government Board's existing functions shall be taken from it. They are provided for in the First Schedule. If at the moment when the Ministry is being formed it is possible to transfer from the Local Government Board the functions mentioned in the First Schedule, what insuperable difficulty is there in transferring from the Ministry of Health the question of dealing with the able-bodied pauper and the general question of the administration of Poor Law relief? I know it will probably be pointed out that, in Subjection (3) of Clause 3, there is a declaration to the effect that at some time these functions in relation to Poor Law administration shall pass from the Ministry of Health, but, if I may say so, that declaration may mean this year, next year, some day, never. We are none of us here in a position to say just what may happen tomorrow, next month, next year, or in the next Parliament, and I desire, as we all do, that the Ministry should start with flying colours and stand well in the opinion of the large body of persons in the country who will come within its purview. To use words that have already been used in speaking of it, I desire that it should be regarded as a friend, as a household word. We are very anxious that it should not start with any stigma of association with the degrading matter of pauperism and Poor Law relief. We desire to strengthen the Ministry, to make it stand well in the eyes of the people, and to take away any thought on the part of ordinary working men and women that the medical relief which they may receive under this new Ministry will be similar to that of the old Poor Law doctor, and we desire that this Ministry shall have no association whatever with Poor Law administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the whole Committee will have considerable sympathy with the greater part of the speech of the hon. Member for Edmonton, who has moved the Amendment, and we all know and recognise the great work he has performed for so long in the friendly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
societies movement. The subject of the administration of the medical service of the Poor Law and its inclusion in the Ministry of Health Bill has been a matter of prolonged discussion with the President of the Local Government Board, and the proposals now in the Bill before the Committee have been to a large extent arrived at by way of compromise with regard to the difficulties which naturally arise. I would remind the Committee and my hon. Friend that the President of the Local Government Board has already given a most express undertaking in the House of Commons. He gave a definite undertaking that it shall be one of the first tasks of the new Ministry to bring forward proposals to carry out the recommendations of the Maclean Report. I must also point out that there is included in this Bill in Clause 3, Sub-section (3), a declaration that it is the intention of this Act that in the event of provision being made for the revision of the law relating to the relief of the poor and the distribution among other authorities of the powers exercised by boards of guardians, there shall be transferred from the Minister to other Government Departments such of the powers and duties under the enactments relating to the relief of the poor, and this is to be done as soon as practicable. These two undertakings go a good way to meet the views of the hon. Member. I would also point out that there are practical difficulties in the way of carrying out the suggestion which he has made. I think I can safely state that none of the friendly societies desire that the new Ministry should not look after the medical side of the Poor Law. This is a most important point, because there are no less than 4,500 doctors employed in the Poor Law medical service, and no less than 700 institutions with 940 beds which treat sick persons, and on 1st January, 1915, there were 270,000 persons in receipt of relief suffering from sickness or bodily infirmity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Amendment were accepted it would immediately mean that all these persons would be taken away from the administrations of the Ministry of Health. That would mean the dislocation of the medical side of the Poor Law, which in the past has been under the Local Government Board, and it would be a matter of considerable difficulty. When you have regard to that it seems that there are very good reasons against the proposal now put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
forward and it would take considerable time to do it, and to rearrange the whole machinery. When it is possible to take under the Ministry of Health the whole Work of looking after the sick poor, it may be done, but then you would have to postpone the Ministry of Health Bill, and we think it is better to take the course we now propose and to take over the medical service having given these two express undertakings that when the time comes the others will be transferred. The work of the Local Government Board in its medical service has been criticised, but a great deal of work has been well and carefully done, and it is not intended in this case to interfere with their work. This is a Bill to deal with a very different question. The hon. Member referred to the effect of this Bill on the Local Government Board, and also to its effect on the Insurance Commissioners. The Leader of the House of Commons on the Second Beading stated that the Local Government Board was not disappearing altogether. The Ministry of Health is not taking the place of the Local Government Board—in fact, it is a new Ministry altogether. We are taking over the health powers of the Local Government Board either immediately or later, and hope to see in the new Ministry a new spirit and a divorce from the Poor Law spirit as the hon. Member desires. If we are to look after the poor of the country, we think this must be the way in which it can be done, with the promise that the medical services of the Local Government Board will be transferred as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. BRAMSDON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee will approach this subject with the consideration that its importance demands. This Amendment has been put forward at the request of friendly societies whom I also have the honour to represent and they are practically unanimous, if not entirely unanimous, concerning it. They wish to be as quickly as possible dissociated from the Poor Law spirit. But if these powers were to be transferred en bloc to the Ministry of Health you would have part of the administration of the Poor Law under the Ministry of Health. That is undesirable. You would have to transfer some of the Poor Law matter to other Departments. The proposal put forward in Sub-section (3), that it shall be taken over as soon as practicable, is a very good one, and it is the same as the Labour
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
Minister has now made. It is a most difficult subject at this particular time. There is some doubt as to what Department the other powers of the Poor Law shall be transferred. Some would have to go, naturally, to the Home Office. I have some sympathy with that, and had something to do with the suggestion, but it is a difficult matter all round, and for that reason you cannot ask the Government to fully carry it out now as proposed in the Amendment. I am sure it will be arranged, after the promises that have been made by the Minister on this subject, that it will be done as soon as practicable and after the adoption of the Maclean Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am associated with the friendly societies and this question has been considered by them more than any other question. I suggested in an Amendment a course which would carry out very much what my hon. Friend has just set out. I suggested that a certain period of time should be fixed in which these proposals in respect to the Poor Law should be carried out, and the date I mentioned was the 31st March, 1924. There were other difficulties, but I thought that was better than simply using the words "as soon as possible."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRIANT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a peculiar position as chairman of a board of guardians, one of the largest in London, and chairman of a board of guardians which is in favour of the abolition of the Poor Law. I cannot say that they approve of what I am saying on this point because they disagree with me, but they have had sufficient confidence in me to elect me for the tenth year to that position. If the powers of the Poor Law medical service were taken over some of them would have to be transferred to a body like the Home Office. The Poor Law is associated not only with the medical service but also with other departments of work, and there are innumerable difficulties in making the change just at present. They have a great number of infirmaries, and the War Office authorities have stated that these infirmaries are not inferior to the best hospitals in London. We should not be too much led away by sentiment. The Minister of Health will not have to do with libraries and museums and other works of the Local Government Board. Nobody will resent that, and there can be no objection to leaving the Poor Law medical service and its officers for the time under the

Local Government Board. I should regard it as a fatal step in the interests of the medical service if it were all to be taken over at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there is really a large amount of agreement, if not unanimity, among the members of the Committee. We all desire to carry out what is indicated in Sub-section (3) for the reform of the Poor Law. I think it is generally agreed that the medical work of the Poor Law have been very well done. When we remember that it has the administration of 700 institutions, and has 4,500 doctors, we can recognise that there will be considerable difficulty in taking them over now. A suggestion has been made that some of the duties will be transferred to the Home Office, but I do not think that the hon. Members are agreed that that would be a progressive step, and I think that the insertion of the Amendment is unnecessary in view of the arrangement suggested in Sub-section (3) of Clause 3, and also in view of the statement made by the right hon. Gentleman with the full authority of the Cabinet that it is their intention to deal with the matter in that way. As regards the proposed time limit of five years I fear it would rather have a tendency to delay matters, because if you told them that it would be five years before they were dealt with the time might probably be extended for at least that five years. One of the first questions to be dealt with is that of Housing, and the question of the Poor Law will be one of the first to be dealt with after that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (1, 	<i>b</i>), to insert the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"including the duties hitherto performed by the Medical Research Committee."</p></blockquote>
I think, perhaps, this is the proper place to consider the question of the allocation of the Research Committee which is at present in the hands of the Insurance Commissioners. It is probably well known that the Medical Research Committee, which is responsible to the Insurance Commissioners, has a revenue which is derived specially from moneys voted by Parliament under Section 16 (2, 6) of the Insurance Act, 1911, and it is called, "The Research Penny." If this Amendment is adopted it will be proposed that the "research penny" should still be collected and be given over to the Health Ministry for the purposes of research.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
There are, I see, other Amendments following the one I am proposing, but if my Amendment is carried, it will be unnecessary to propose the Amendment on the Paper with regard to the proviso, because this Amendment is intended to hand over at once to the Ministry of Health the duties of the Research Committee now carried on by the Insurance Commissioners and not to make it a separate Department under the Privy Council. It seems almost unintelligible and most difficult to realise that we are now proposing the establishment of a Ministry of Health from which the question of medical research shall be eliminated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is to be no part of its work and duties—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Local Government Board can do it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proviso suggests that the Medical Research Committee shall, after the date of the commencement of the Act be carried on by or under the direction of the Committee of the Privy Council, and it shall no longer be carried on by or under the direction, as we suggest, of the Minister of Health. The reasons against this proposal, which was suggested by the President of the Local Government Board, in his speech in introducing this measure were thus stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Ministry of Health which is proposed to be set up here, with qualifications to which I will refer later on, relates to different parts of the United Kingdom—England and Wales—but if the Medical Research Organisation, the Central Organisation, including England and Wales, merely you would have the Scottish Board of Health, and my right hon. Friend the Scottish Minister of Health claiming too, and the same I suppose would be the case as to Ireland. Knowledge is not limited to any particular part of the United Kingdom."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th February, 1919 Vol. 112, col. 1824.]</p></blockquote>
The last part of that statement, of course, is very true and very important to bear in mind. Personally, I see no objection to a large number of research Departments in different parts of the country. I do not see why in the question of medical research there should necessarily be any limitation to the number of persons engaged in research. We all know now how important a part research plays in the progress of medical science and also in medical education. Medical education in the future, as it was in the past, will no longer consist merely of lectures or clinical work, but will depend very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
largely on the results of discoveries which are made by research committees; and research and methods of research must form an important part of medical education wherever it may be carried on—in universities and other places. We all know, too, the striking connection that exists between pure science and science applied to any particular department of industry. I need only refer to the discovery of radium in France, which has had a very important effect on medical practice, nor need I fail to mention the German discovery—one of the few discoveries made in the last fifteen years of importance—the discovery of the Rontgen rays, which has also had a very important influence on medical practice. Therefore, it is very difficult indeed to distinguish between researches carried on for the purpose of pure science and those which may happen to be applicable to medical science or medical education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this reason, it seems to me most desirable that the Ministry of Health shall have under its own control and direction a research department, to which it can refer problems as they arise. They will arise in many cases, and there need be no fear of any undesirable competition between different scientific bodies in the matter of research. The more the better in that case, and if in Wales, or Scotland, or Ireland, under a research department, some discovery is made which may be applicable to medical practice and medical science, so much the better. The very fact that there is a Research Department in the Ministry of Health, which may not have made a particular discovery, will be no reason whatever for not welcoming the discovery made by some other research committee. Therefore, I can see no valid reasons why this Research Department should not be at once affiliated to the new Ministry. A pamphlet was recently published by the British Medical Association, and I am not certain that someone in this Committee had not a hand in writing at any rate a part of it. It says, under the heading "Research," that, so far as the application of knowledge already acquired by research goes, experience has alone been considered. But one of the main duties of the Ministry of Health would be the prosecution of scientific research, the analysis of statistics, and the study of results of experience in the application of old and new methods. The Medical Research Com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
mittee is responsible to the Insurance Commissioners, and it should form part of the Ministry of Health. I feel that to be so much the case that I find it unnecessary to argue the point at any great length. I am certain I am supported by the members of the medical profession present at this Committee. I know it has been said that if this research department is set up, under the direction of the Ministry of Health, it would interfere to some extent with its independence. I cannot understand what is meant by that. Why should it interfere with its independence in any sense whatever? That is the only argument I have heard. I know, also, there is considerable difference of opinion even amongst scientific men as to whether this Department should be under the Privy Council or belong to the Ministry of Health. The only argument I have heard on that point is that under the Privy Council it would be more free than under the Ministry of Health. But that seems to me an argument without any authority to support it. I do not wish to labour this question at any length. I believe that a good many other Members better qualified by their experience are prepared to speak on this, and I will, therefore, simply move the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that, at first sight, it does seem extraordinary that the Medical Research Department should be divorced from the Ministry of Health. But I think if one remembers the position at present, it does have a considerable bearing upon the future of the Medical Research Department. At the present time, it is true, the Medical Research Department is associated with the National Insurance Joint Committee. It is also perfectly true that the funds which pay for that committee come from the Exchequer, and are collected on a basis of the sum of one penny for each insured person. It should not be forgotten, when this matter is discussed, that the Local Government Board has, at the present time, its own Medical Research Department. It has had it for many years, and it has done a certain amount of good work, but we are confronted to-day with a Bill which is before the Committee in respect of England and Wales alone. I have some knowledge of the approved societies of the country, and I know approved societies which administer their insurance business in Scotland and in Ireland. I cannot conceive for a moment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
that they would agree that the penny per person in respect of Scottish and Irish members should be in any way dealt with by an English and Welsh Ministry alone. I think the Committee want to bear this matter in mind, that as President of the Local Government Board my hon. Friend stated in the 'House of Commons that the whole subject of medical research is not a matter of geographical limits, and I think all of us are hoping that medical research in the future will not be limited to this country alone, but may prove to be a truly Imperial Department. If that is so, undoubtedly the proper Department which should supervise it, at any rate at the present time, until we see, as I hope we shall, a great forward movement, is the Department mentioned in this Bill, namely, the Privy Council. Members of this Committee will not, I hope, accede to this Motion. They must bear in mind that the Ministry of Health will still have its own research department and still do its own internal inquiries on matters which come before it. It is, undoubtedly, a great help. I have taken part in a good many discussions on this matter, and I know it is a great thing for the Department who wants its medical research work done to be able to go to a medical research department, not associated with a Ministry which is confined to England and Wales alone, but to one which is associated with a Department which does give it a certain amount of independence. I must say, for my part, directly you limited this Ministry to England Wales, you could not logically expect a medical research department, which must of necessity deal with the whole country, if not with the whole of our Dominions, to be attached to a purely English and Welsh Ministry. I think that is a fatal objection to my hon. Friend's proposal. I am sure the whole Committee desire to see medical research work expedited and far more money spent on it. It is, I think, one of the great mistakes we have made in the last few years in being rather cheese-paring in regard to such a Department. If you are going to give more money for medical research, you must not ask for it for a Department which simply deals with England and Wales alone, but it should rather go to a Department which makes it for the whole country and for the whole of our Colonies and Dominions. I hope my hon. Friend will see there are real reasons why this Amendment cannot be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HILLS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree with the last speaker. As he has said, one is apt to think that, of all things, medical research is the one thing that ought to come under a Ministry of Health. I hope to be able to prove that it ought not. My reasons are these: Research is conducted by men of science who are blasting in the road and finding the way. These men should be entirely free and independent to carry on research in their own way, for research can only take place by conflict with existing institutions which must be continually improved by criticism, and finding fault with the existing administration. The one administration with which the Research Department will be in conflict if progress is to be made, must be the administration of the Ministry of Health. Progress is made by pointing out to the world the mistakes which have been made, and I appeal with confidence to my hon. Friend opposite, that he would surely stifle research if he put that research under any Ministry, however far-sighted. Now research is finding its way, it is groping along and is advancing by its own methods, therefore I suggest you should not put it under a Ministry which, after all, is human, and does not like to be criticised. A great Department of this sort would not, with all respect to my right hon. Friend, welcome criticisms that condemn its administration. The Medical Research Committee under the Privy Council has done most extraordinarily good work. I believe they are responsible for the investigation and diagnosis of many of the diseases which afflicted our men in France, Belgium and the East, and I submit it would be a step backwards if the work were taken away from them. I hope the Committee will not accept the Amendment. I believe research is now in the right hands, and if you take it away from the Privy Council, I shall regard it as a retrograde step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel RAW</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a question upon which I feel very strongly. At the same time, I am not going to press my views before the Committee. I certainly think that as this is the greatest Health Bill that has ever been put before any Parliament in the world, it ought to have the very finest and best facilities for carrying out its research work. The great object of the Ministry of Health Bill, is not so much to cure disease as to prevent it, and unless this Ministry of Health has attached to it under its own

direction, the control of the very best medical and scientific, expert advice which it is possible to get in the country, in my opinion, it will prove deficient and for that reason only, I strongly urge that the Research Committee should be brought under the control of the Ministry of Health. I have a very considerable knowledge of this Medical Research Committee, because it carried out most of the investigating work regarding disease in France. I happened to be there for a considerable time, and saw an enormous amount of the work of this committee, and I can but speak in the very highest terms and with the greatest admiration of the work it has done. The only point I am very insistent upon is that this Ministry of Health Bill would not be complete if it had not the very best advisory research committee at its immediate disposal. Suppose we had a great epidemic of some disease sweeping over this country? The Ministry of Health ought to be able to ask its own Research Committee to investigate that disease instantly, and on the spot. I maintain it could not do it if the Research Committee remained outside the Ministry. It is perfectly true that it is a very good thing to aim at having an Imperial Research Committee which is quite beyond all departments, but we are here to-day to pass the Ministry of Health Bill, and we can only deal with the Research Committee as it affects this particular Bill. I think, therefore, that the matter resolves itself into a very simple proposition. Ought the Medical Research Committee to be attached to this Ministry and so be given an enormous strength in the minds of the public; or should it be detached and out of control of the Minister of Health? I sincerely hope the Committee will take the view that the Ministry of Health ought to rotain this important Research Committee under its own control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major FARQUHARSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal to be said on both sides of this argument. I yield to none in my admiration for the work of the Medical Research Committee and in my desire that the Ministry of Health should have its own investigating department. But we must not take too limited a view of the functions of the Medical Research Committee. Without being too selfish, I think we can almost hope that this Medical Research Committee will have a very much wider and more effective scientific horizon, if it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
be placed within the jurisdiction of the Privy Council than if it be attached to the Ministry of Health. I am perfectly confident of that, from my own experience of its work and of the extent of the research which the Local Government Board has hitherto carried on. The Local Government Board does excellent routine work, and it is the right authority to do excellent routine work, but if this Amendment is rejected, and if in two or three years there is a virulent epidemic, the nature of which is absolutely unknown, the House of Commons will demand to know from the Minister of Health what he has done to investigate the matter, and whether he has looked into it from a scientific point of view. If the Bill remains as now drafted, I suggest, with all deference, that the Minister of Health of the day will have to reply, "There is nothing within the four walls of this Statute which authorises me to conduct a scientific investigation into this disease; that is the business of the Medical Research Committee." And such a reply would be quite reasonable. Whether that be so or not, I think that this is a case for give and take. I am perfectly certain that the doctors—of a committee of whom I have the honour to be secretary—do not wish as a whole to press for the inclusion of this Medical Research Committee within the Department of the Minister of Health, but they do press for some real, live thing which may within the walls of the Ministry of Health take the place of this Research Committee, and I put it to the right hon. Gentleman sitting opposite to me (Major Astor) that if he would in as simple language as he pleases, insert such words as would give us this compromise, I think it would almost completely meet the view of the doctors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir WILLIAM WHITLA</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great deal can be said on both sides of this question. I think nothing is more needed in medicine than medical research. For want of it this country has been for many years in a disgraceful position as compared with Continental countries. I believe that under the Privy Council medical research will have a wider scope than it can possibly have under this Ministry. I am satisfied also that you must have splendid machinery under the Ministry of Health as well, and if a compromise is made—and I advocate a compromise—there cannot possibly be too much competition in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
original research. I want the Committee also to understand that there can be no practical objection to overlapping. If the research work of the Privy Council is going on, there is no reason why the same research work should not be going on in many laboratories throughout the United Kingdom. To my mind the situation is quite clear and crystallised. There should be a compromise. Let insurance work go on under the Privy Council, but it will not meet the Irish or the Scottish situation. But if a compromise is to be satisfactory you must have an equally splendid arrangement made for the Minister of Health. He will subsidise the universities throughout the Kingdom, and he can have men working for him there. He will require one or two in Ireland, two or three in England, one or two in Scotland, perhaps one in Wales. An enormous impetus will be given to original research, and that should be under the Ministry of Health. If the Ministry of Health can merely get a shoddy sort of arrangement with a few thousands a year I would support the proposal of the hon. Member for London University. Unaccustomed as I am to the methods of screwing money out of the Treasury, I am not clear whether the Minister of Health can get large Grants-in-Aid, but if he can I think this Committee should not hesitate for one moment to start on the project of two departments of research, one under the Privy Council and one under the Ministry of Health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather afraid that the Committee is under some misconception. As far as I can make out from the Bill this Amendment will achieve exactly the opposite purpose to that for which it was designed. As I understand the position, according to the Bill, as now drafted, the Local Government Board at the present time can appoint research committees of all kinds. It was only quite recently, I think, that the Local Government Board on its own initiative set up a special committee to inquire into the influenza epidemic. They have always had that power, and under the Bill all the existing powers and duties of the Local Government Board are transferred 	<i>en bloc</i> to the Ministry of Health. There is nothing to prevent the Ministry of Health from setting up for its own purposes a Medical Research Committee of its own of the very best kind, and therefore it will be able to achieve the very purpose that is suggested by this particular Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Local Government Board at the present time has a Medical Research Committee. Under this Bill the powers of the Local Government Board are transferred to the Ministry of Health, and that includes, therefore, the Medical Research Committee. Therefore, under this Ministry of Health Bill, you already have your research committee doing its work, and we hope, following the opinion just expressed by my hon. Friend, that the Committee will get funds and be able to do its work better and more efficiently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that a Medical Research Committee appointed 	<i>ad hoc</i> for the solution of a specific problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so, but Parliament is always able to criticise the character of that Research Committee at any time on the Votes for the Board and on other occasions, and it can insist upon the improvement of the status and position of the Committee. But, as I understand the proviso, the point is that there is a very complicated National Insurance Act—which has had a rather unfortunate career—in existence at the present moment. In that Act there is a provision with regard to certain of the funds collected by devious ways set up in the Act—an arrangement that out of those funds there shall be maintained a certain Medical Research Committee. This Bill, unfortunately, has to deal with that Insurance Act and its problems rather piecemeal, because the Act applies in a complicated way to England, Scotland, and Ireland, whereas this Bill is only to apply to England and Wales. I can quite see the difficulty of the Local Government Board in having to carve off a piece of the Insurance Act and possibly finding themselves unless they are very careful, with this Medical Research Committee and the money on which it relies hanging in the air. The Local Government Board therefore had to consider very complicated Amendments of the Insurance Act and its financial arrangements in order to make some simple provision for the Medical Research Committee, and that is contained in the proviso that "the power conferred on the Insurance Commissioners by the proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section sixteen of the National Insurance Act, 1911,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
of retaining and applying for the purposes of research such sums as are therein mentioned shall not be transferred to the Minister." We therefore get our Research Committee for the Ministry of Health in any form it likes. Scotland will also get its own Committee and an additional Committee under the Insurance Act as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Medical Research Committee, as I understand, deals with the whole of the United Kingdom, and as the Government are going to cut Scotland out of the Bill it cannot possibly provide any Medical Research Committee for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After listening to the very interesting discussion, I think there really is agreement, although perhaps there is a certain amount of misunderstanding among the different members of the Committee. I think we all want the same thing, and are all agreed that the same thing ought to be done. The only point is that there are certain doubts in the minds of one or two members of the Committee as to what they want done, and what I know we want done, and in fact will be done, under the Bill as now drafted. One or two Members have said that the Minister of Health must be in close touch with and be able to control the Medical Research Committee. He must be able to turn to that Committee in case, for instance, of an epidemic. That is exactly what happens at the present moment. You have a Medical Research Committee not associated with any Department, not associated with any country. The War Office turns to it; the Home Office turns to it; the Local Government Board turns to it. In addition to that—and here I think is where the misapprehension arises—the Minister of Health in the same way as the President of the Local Government Board will be able under the Bill as now drafted to do his own research, to have his own laboratories, and to subsidise people in laboratories outside of his own immediate Department. He has that power now, and he will still have it. The whole basis of the prevention and treatment of disease is experimental research.

It is a fallacy to imagine, merely because in the illustrative words in Clause 2 the word "research" is not specifically included, that therefore it is excluded. As
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
a matter of fact, the Minister of Health, like the President of the Local Government Board, will be able to do his research in his own laboratories. He has that power now, and it will be for Parliament to support the Minister when he asks for a Vote. The money that is going to be devoted to research in the future is not going to come out of the penny, as it does now. It is going to be a special Vote, and I think that is why we are all agreed as to what we want. We want the Minister of Health, and we want whatever corresponds to him to-day in Scotland, in Ireland, and in Wales, if you like, to go on with their own research. But over and above that we want the Medical Research Committee, which is international and interdepartmental, to continue. The hon. and gallant Member for North Leeds said that he wanted both to go on. I agree. It is because we want both to go on that the Bill is drafted as it is at the present moment. The Medical Research Committee, because it is not attached to any particular Department or any particular Minister, or any particular country, is able to co-ordinate work. For instance, we have work on tubercle going on at the present moment in Edinburgh and Dublin, and we have work on rickets going on in Glasgow, Sheffield, Cambridge, London, and Bristol. It is very much easier for a body like this, which is not under an English Minister, to do its work and to correlate it. I think that the reason why some Members want to put in the words which they suggest is that they are not satisfied with the work which has been done in the past by the Local Government-Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

what the proposals are there will be agreement amongst the members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not understand them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had made myself clear. There will be research, both in the laboratories of the Minister of Health and also outside of those laboratories, but under the direction of the English Minister of Health, in England and Wales. There will be research in Scotland and Ireland also if the money is voted; but in addition to that it is proposed that this body, which has done such good work hitherto, shall continue that work and not be broken up. After all, we have to consider what the facts are. I suggest that the Committee ought to be influenced by the fact that the Minister of Health and the members of the Medical Research Committee are in complete agreement. Why should the Minister of Health say, "Do not give me this"? What he is setting out for is to get more things into his hands, and after mature reflection and consideration he says, "I want to do my own research, but in addition to that I do not want to break up the good work done by this body, which covers the whole of the United Kingdom." I am the chairman of that Committee, and its members and their staff—they have been consulted quite recently—are agreed that the work which they have been doing ought to continue not under a Ministry of Health for England and Wales, but under the Privy Council with the same sort of general relationship as now exists. May I explain, in order to make it quite clear, what occurred when the Medical Research Committee was originally set up? Careful consideration was then given to the question whether it should be put under the English Department or not, and for the same reason that actuates us now—namely, that it was thought unwise that this body, which was deliberately intended to have no national or geographical boundaries; and because it was realised that there would be a distinct limitation if it were put under an English Department—it was not put under any English Department or Minister. At the present time it is the Chairman of the Joint Committee who is responsible. It has a Minister who is representative of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, but he is not an English Minister, although he represents an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
English constituency. I said the members of the Committee were unanimous in favour of our proposals. Outside opinion has also been consulted, and we have the support of the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians, and the British Medical Association. Some time ago the Government decided to spend a certain amount of money in research on agriculture and forestry. They did not go to the Board of Agriculture. They have their own organisation for research, and, in addition to that, there is the Development Fund which was set up specifically to go into investigations particularly for agriculture and forestry. There is also the question of scientific research, which may be treated by the Board of Trade or the Ministry of Labour, under the Privy Council. That is one of the reasons why we say it should be under the Privy Council, and that it should be within the power of the Ministry of Health to develop and increase the work which now exists under the Local Government Board. Let hon. Members support him when the time comes to ask Parliament for more money for the purpose. That is the only thing the Minister requires. You cannot give him money for research under this Bill, but you can support him when he asks the House of Commons for it. I do not say it is necessary to give new powers under this Bill, because that brings us to one of the difficulties that might arise in the case of medical research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that some time or other the question may have to be decided whether or not the industrial health research should be under the Home Office or should come under the Ministry of Health. Supposing the Home Secretary is fighting against its being transferred and the Minister of Health is fighting against him do you think he would refer the matter of industrial health research to the Minister of Health? He would rather send it to another body to which he had less antagonism. That objection would not apply to the Privy Council. Our experience during the War is that in various Departments the inconvenience of these interdepartmental difficulties was shown. In this case all such matter would go to the Medical Research Committee and there would be a continuance of its work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
persuasive powers of the Government Members. We were told that the Medical Research Committee was unanimous in support of the proposed transfer. I ask the Chairman of that Committee whether there was not a stormy meeting at which Sir Almroth Wright spoke. So far as I am told he nearly persuaded some of the Members to his side. I was told that after he had given his oration Professor Bulloch was almost persuaded, and might have been persuaded if he had not been pledged beforehand on the other side, so that in the Medical Research Committee the unanimity was not so complete as we have heard. I am inclined to go back to the old platitude that there is a great deal to be said on both sides, but I am afraid the Government has torpedoed the opposition by cutting out Scotland and Ireland. I consider that what we see before us is an important constitutional development or one of the first steps towards such a development. We have federal bodies for England, Scotland, and Ireland and Wales and an Imperial Commission for all. Medical research should be under the Ministry of Health, but I feel that the Government have good reason when they say that in such a matter there should be an Imperial Ministry, and the Minister of Health is certainly not an Imperial Minister. The Government may divorce the Medical Research Committee from the Ministry of Health, but it is an unsound division. Medical research should be one of its big objects, and this is an unsound proposal the effect of which will be shown more and more as time goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman continues the services of the local bodies they will wipe out in some matters the work of the central bodies. The Medical Research Committee does no research itself. It spends money. It sends out to the universities and various other bodies and pays them to do the work of research. There is the Committee working at present on the subject of rickets in Glasgow. It is engaging the professor of physiology and his laboratories to do it. If the Local Government Board wants to carry out research on rickets in Glasgow, and I agree that there is need for research into rickets in Glasgow, it must go to Professor Paton and ask him to carry the work out. That is an instance of the lack of co-operation among various Departments which will be intensified under the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
The geographical difficulty, however, seems to be insuperable. This Medical Research Committee is autonomous, and I ask that all these bodies should be under the suzerainty of the Ministry of Health. I should like to know what co-ordination there is to be between them. Will you grant joint members of the Committee? Will the Ministry of Health have power to appoint a member of the Committee, and see that he keeps up with all the work the Medical Research Committee are doing? It seems to me that there is no organic connection provided for in the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. MURRAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have the unusual spectacle of all the doctors agreeing on this question, and I do not know whether that should be taken as a ground of suspicion or not. I think that the geographical difficulty with regard to the bringing about of a Ministry of Health to cover England, Scotland and Ireland has been very great. You will have Scotland up in arms and it may be another injustice to poor old Ireland. All the same the question has not been settled by the statement made for the Ministry of Health to-day. The impression that has been made upon me is that under the Local Government Board research has been looked upon as a side-show, instead of being the crowning glory of its work. They have put us into a difficulty with regard to the Research Committee, and we want to be sure that research under the new Ministry will not be a small and unimportant part of the work, and that we shall have a Department of some standing which will put new life into its health work. It must get into touch with the industries at home and with the Colonies abroad, and there should be a joint committee of the various Departments, something like the Joint Committee under the Insurance Act. It should have power to keep some kind of a bureau, and should be really international in dealing with research. I hope the subject of science will be kept at the front. I do not think it will be found that medical men will give trouble to their masters. In matters of research they will not be afraid to state their own opinions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much in agreement with what the hon. Member has just said.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
see that avoided. If the Minister could make some statement indicating how it could be avoided it would have a good effect, because medical research should be one of the most important matters under the control of the Ministry. I hope he will make such a statement, and I should be willing to withdraw my Amendment. It is an unfortunate fact that the question of scientific investigation seems to be excluded from this Department. There is nothing about science from first to last in the Bill. If an assurance on this subject also could be given, it would go a long way to meet our views. It does not seem to be much use giving power to collect statistics if the Department has not to make use of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before dealing with the proposal I should like to deal with the statement about Sir Almroth Wright. He is not a member of the Research Committee, but is one of the permanent staff. It is not correct to say that there was any disagreement in the Committee or that there was a stormy discussion. After he had delivered his speech the members said that they had not altered their opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I was misinformed, and I accept Major Astor's statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member opposite has made a very fair suggestion, and I will put it to the Presi dent that on the Report stage we shall insert words which I think were on the Paper this morning in the name of the hon. Member for the Scottish Universities—"The initiation and direction of research." I think I can meet my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having regard to the statement of the hon. Member in charge of the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, c) after the word "to" ["with respect to"] to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the medical inspection and treatment of children and young persons, and"</p></blockquote>
This again is an Amendment to give increasing powers to the Ministry of Health. I see in Sub-section (1, 	<i>c</i>) it is provided that there shall be transferred to the Ministry
	<br><blockquote><p>"all the powers of the Board of Education with respect to attending to the health of expectant mother's and nursing mothers and of children who have not attained the age of five years and are not in attendance at schools recognised by the Board of Education."</p></blockquote>
We have understood that one of the main objects of this Bill was to co-ordinate the work relating to health, carried on by different Departments of State, and no valid reason has been assigned at present for the piecemeal legislation which is suggested by this Clause of the Bill. It is true that later on it is stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be lawful for His Majesty from time to time, by Order in Council, to transfer to the Ministry all or any of the powers and duties of the Board of Education with respect to the medical inspection and treatment of children and young persons."</p></blockquote>
It is very difficult to see why that should not be done at once. Would it not be simpler to take over the whole of the medical work now carried on under the distinguished direction of the Medical Officer of the Board of Education, who has rendered the greatest possible service on all questions relating to children's health and to health generally? It would seem very much better to take it over altogether than to do it piecemeal, taking over part at the present moment and leaving the larger part to be taken over later on By an Order in Council. This is the first time the words "Order in Council" appear in the Bill, but it is not the last by any means, for nothing is more remarkable in this Bill than the fact that nearly everything is to be done by Orders in Council. I am anxious that the services now performed by the Board of Education should be transferred without an Order in Council. I need scarcely remind members of the Committee that they will have very little to do with any Order in Council that may be made. An Order in Council is one of the things I never understood. I do not know how it is created. I have never seen one and have never known any discussion on one in the House; yet the larger part of the work of this Bill is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
to be carried on by an Order in Council. I take it that an Order in Council is something drawn up by the permanent officials of the Department which is then laid on the Table of the House, but I am not quite certain how any discussion upon it can be instituted, although I am told that it can be done by a memorial from both Houses of Parliament. Still, I am not aware how that memorial is to be presented, or what is done with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want in connection with this Bill is to know as far as possible what the Bill is to do, how the Ministry is to be constituted, and how the work is to be done. We do not want it to be indicated or suggested merely by an Order in Council. As I may have to make a similar objection to other Clauses of the Bill in which the words "Order in Council" appear, I thought I had better mention this matter at once. There may be very valid reasons for withholding from the Ministry of Health at the present time services which are now carried on by the Board of Education, but I personally object as strongly as possible to this piecemeal legislation. The reasons why the Ministry of Health, which we hope will be established and will undertake and co-ordinate the health work done by different Departments of the State, should take over very important work carried on by the officers of health under the direction of the Board of Education are very strong. It may be said that the new Ministry of Health ought not to take upon itself too many responsibilities at one time. I believe that is the argument which is going to be put forward. My reply is, that it is a very poor argument and that surely it would be easier for the new Ministry to make itself cognisant with the whole of the work of the Department at once. We must have new officers appointed under the Ministry of Health to carry on part of the work of the Board of Education which is to be taken over, and some of the officers at present engaged on health work by the Board will remain. You will be creating vested interests in the Board of Education which it may be difficult afterwards to get rid of; therefore we had better now take over the whole of the work than leave a part of it to the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend will press this Amendment. I have a similar Amendment on the Paper,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
but I think that of my hon. Friend is much the better. I was simply amazed when I read this Bill to find that all children over live years were left under the education authority. I think it is a most amazing mistake, and I cannot imagine the carrying out of the duties incumbent on a Ministry of Health and leaving out the children of five years of age and over. It is during those years, from the ages of five to fifteen, that the future health of the man or woman, as the case may be, is largely determined. Therefore I cannot imagine why they are left out from the operation of this measure. I would like to mention one fact. I do not know whether it will have any effect on the governors. But it was one of the greatest wishes of Lord Rhondda that the treatment of young persons should come under the Ministry of Health. Lady Rhondda made a speech the other day in which she said that if they were going to save the health of men and women they must start at the beginning, and she went on to add that her father wanted this new Ministry mainly because it would help to give children a good start in life. I cannot understand this omission. I am afraid that the President of the Local Government Board will have great difficulty with other Departments. I believe there have been a great many jealousies about the establishment of this Ministry of Health, and I have not the slightest doubt in my own mind that the reason why we are pushing into the future all kinds of duties and providing that they shall be taken over by Order in Council, is because the Board of Education want to stick to their powers as long as possible. The present system is simply ridiculous. The Board of Education at the moment, if a child goes to its school with a verminous head, has power to cleanse that head, but it has no power to go into the home of the child and cleanse the home, so that the child goes back into the home with all its filthy surroundings and returns to the school a few weeks later with its head again verminous. I suggest that is really a most ridiculous system, and I cannot understand why the Government should assent to it. I hope the hon. Baronet will press his Amendment to a Division. I had rather see these powers in the Bill than almost any other provision. You have only to take the question of teeth. It is simply lamentable to see young persons wearing false teeth at fifteen, sixteen, or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
seventeen years of age. The whole question ought to be undertaken by a central authority, and in my opinion the Ministry of Health is the proper authority. I therefore heartily support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid there is no very logical reason why I cannot accept the hon. Baronet's Amendment, but, before I go into that, I may deal with the point raised by the last speaker with reference to Lord Rhondda and what Lady Rhondda is stated to have said. The fact is, that Lord Rhondda set out to do what we propose in the Bill as now drafted, namely, to deal with infants. In the next Sub-section we deal with midwives, and this Clause, as explained by my right hon. Friend on the Second Reading, has been very largely drafted so as to bring the mother and the child together. I am perfectly well aware of the fact that logically the Mover and supporters of this Amendment are quite right in their proposal, but I want to put this to them. The work is now being very well done. My hon. Friend says he wants to deal with the question of teeth. I do not know whether he suggests that if that particular responsibility were handed on to the Ministry of Health it would be better done than it is at the moment. Sir George Newman is still Chief Medical Officer under the Board of Education, and he has also been appointed Principal Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, so that there is a connecting link between the two. We want to get certain diseases under one Department and under one Minister. This Department deals with people who are afflicted with tubercle. The children in the school whom it is proposed to deal with by this Amendment are already in a watertight compartment. We have huge work and huge tasks ahead of us. Here is a bit of work which is being very well done. We have a great many difficult tasks to perform. We have to develop the health service, to deal with tubercle, venereal diseases, maternity, and infant welfare, and it is only for that reason that we do not at the present moment propose the transfer of those powers to the Ministry. But we take power to do it as soon as it is mutually convenient to the President of the Board of Education and to the Minister of Health. At the present we see we are going to have plenty to do. We do not, indeed, quite know the extent of the task ahead of us, but we have plenty to get on with, and as soon as we are ready to take over any more work
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
we shall ask other Ministries to transfer it to us. It may not be logical, but it is practical, and it is for that reason I am afraid I cannot ask the Committee to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir EDGAR JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not attempt to come to a decision on this very important matter this afternoon, as it is one we shall have to approach with considerable care. I have always been very much interested since I have been in the House of Commons in the transfer of duties of this kind to the Education authorities of the country. These duties have but very recently been put into the hands of the Education authority, and, having regard to the recent date of the transfer and to the fact that in many districts in the country considerable preparations have been made by institutions which have carried on this work with most admirable results so far as the health of the children is concerned, I think we should hesitate before we accept this Amendment of the hon. Baronet, which involves a reversal of the Act of Parliament which entrusted these duties to the Education Committees all over the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

You cannot possibly have the Education Committees under the Ministry of Health one day in the week and under the Minister for Education another day. It is quite clear that the functions the Minister of Health is going to perform will have to be performed by the Health Committees in the different boroughs, and I can quite see great difficulties will arise through a rearrangement of this work. It is really a matter to be decided by local opinion. We cannot say here and now how much shall be under the Local Government Board, or how much under the Board of Education. I therefore venture to hope that the decision on this matter will not be pressed now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
