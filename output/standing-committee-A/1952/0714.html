<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works (Mr. Hugh Molson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 6, to leave out from "land," to the first "or," in line 7, and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"comprising, or contiguous or adjacent to, any such building."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson), in his Second Reading speech, pointed out that there was a difference in the definition of land in Clauses 4 and 5, and said that he preferred the definition in Clause 5. He asked why there had been a difference in the definition. The reason was that Clause 4 deals with buildings, land and so on, in respect of which the Minister may make grants out of moneys provided by Parliament, and it was thought that it would be desirable for that to be confined to such land as was comprised in the amenities of the building. In the case of Clause 5, it is a matter of acquiring by purchase or gift, and it was thought that there might well be land which it was desirable to acquire but which would not be included within the amenities.<br><br>
On thinking the matter over, we came to the conclusion that the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North is right, and that it would be simpler and better to have the same definition in both Clauses. Therefore, on behalf of my right hon. Friend, I am moving this Amendment which will have the effect of widening the definition in order that all land:
<br><blockquote><p>"comprising, or contiguous or adjacent to, any such building."</p></blockquote>
which I understand means not necessarily actually touching the building, may be included.<br><br>
Much the same thought had apparently occurred to some of my hon. Friends who put down an Amendment which would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 548</span>
have had somewhat the same effect to the one I am now moving; it added the words "contiguous and adjacent" but would have left in the reference to amenities. I therefore hope that they also will be satisfied with this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend for accepting this point. I think it is desirable to have one definition throughout the Bill, and that, on the whole, this is the better definition in that it is less specific. We are all agreed that the less specific we are in this Bill, the better it will be for its administration.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 15, after "conditions," to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"as to public access and such other conditions."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think this Amendment might be taken with the Amendments in page 3, line 15, leave out "think fit to," and to page 3, line 15. at the end, add:
<br><blockquote><p>"and in any event shall be subject to the condition that the public shall have the right of access at all reasonable times to any building and to any land held therewith."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We naturally want to abbreviate debate, but I think the Amendment to line 15, to leave out "think fit to." is linguistic and might be taken separately. It is not the same point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very good; we will take this Amendment and that to line 15 in the name of the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we were considering the Bill on Second Reading, many hon. Members on both sides urged that it was essential that, if national funds were to be made available for the maintenance of these private properties which were to remain, we hoped, in private occupation, there should be no question that public access should be provided for as a proper condition, just as the National Trust, in many cases and under somewhat similar conditions, make rather similar provisions.<br><br>
When the Minister spoke on Second Reading, he indicated that he would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 549</span>
desire that this sort of provision should be made, but he instanced one or two cases where it might be difficult so to do. He suggested that sometimes it might be felt desirable to make national moneys available for the repair and maintenance of small houses or even cottages in villages or towns where it would be unreasonable to expect that public access should be made available, and one can quite see that there may be a limited number of cases of this sort. Although it is generally understood that the bulk of the very limited funds to be made available are to be devoted to much larger properties with estates and so on, there may be individual instances, however, where access may not be practicable.<br><br>
Nevertheless, we feel that it should be clearly understood by everyone that there is a definite value accruing to the general public out of the provisions of this Bill, and it should not be thought, even mistakenly, that here the State was making financial provisions and was receiving nothing in return. That would be felt to be quite intolerable, and, therefore, my right hon. Friend has drafted an Amendment, which we think is a modest one, which will enable the Minister, in the relatively few cases where it might be undesirable to insist upon public access, to leave those cases out if he feels it is desirable. It is understood that, in the generality of cases, access should be provided. After all, this is what we want the Bill for. We want to make sure that these fine houses should be open to the general public under proper and reasonable conditions, and that we should all derive some enjoyment and education from them, which I am quite sure they can provide.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will accept the Amendment. If he feels he can agree to the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher), we shall be happy, and if he can make it mandatory, we shall be very glad, but, if the right hon. Gentleman feels that that is not possible, for the reasons which he mentioned when introducing the Bill to the House, we on our part would be willing to accept the modified wording which we have here in this Amendment. I hope the Minister will accept the Amendment, if not in identical terms, then an Amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 550</span>
which will convey the same sense, so that, even though we are quite sure that his intentions are pure and honest in this respect, it should be made perfectly well known throughout the country that this is one of the prime objects of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Molson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is absolutely no difference between the intention of the Government and that of the hon. Member for Newcastle-on-Tyne, East (Mr. Blenkinsop). It is our intention that in all normal cases there shall be a right of public access to all houses or buildings which benefit under this Bill. I would, therefore, remind hon. Members that there was quite a long discussion in the Gowers Report about the various uses to which these historic buildings could be put, and although that Committee said that in many cases they were not as attractive to visit when put to practical use, they did emphasise that there may be a number of cases where local authorities or public bodies of one kind or another might find some benefit by the use of buildings of this sort, and the Committee thought it was desirable that, in suitable cases, they should be put to purposes of that kind. There has been discussion, and my right hon. Friend has indicated that he hopes that after this Bill comes into operation, the Ministry of Works will act, as far as possible, as an employment bureau for buildings, and will continue to do all that can be done to find practical uses for them.<br><br>
It was also pressed upon us by various hon. Members that a number of interesting and historical buildings, including quite small buildings, in towns, should also benefit under the Bill. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) referred to Kirkcudbright and various burghs in Scotland which he hoped would be included with real benefit in preserving the historic use of houses. I am sure that many of us in England feel that places like Bath, where there are terraces reminiscent of the best period of 18th Century town planning, may also benefit in this way, and, obviously, it would be difficult, if not intolerable, for the ordinary people occupying those houses in Bath if there was a general right of access. We are, therefore, of the opinion that it would be better to have nothing explicit in the Bill on the right of access, because, if it is included, we should have to insist that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 551</span>
Minister might have a right of excluding the right of access in cases where it was found to be quite unsuitable.<br><br>
Although we do not feel very strongly opposed to the Amendment, we could not accept the somewhat more stringent Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Islington, East. We think that, on the whole, it would be more convenient if the Bill did not contain this general instruction, but only these additional words which would allow that instruction could be excluded in suitable cases. I hope, however, that hon. Gentlemen opposite will not think it necessary to press the Amendment, in view of the assurance which I have given of the spirit in which the Bill will be administered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. K. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the Minister to think again about this matter, because we have deliberately worded the Amendment in such a way as not to make it mandatory on the Minister. It is absolutely essential, from the point of view of the general public, that it should be made quite clear to them that the main purpose of preserving these houses is not for private benefit but for public good.<br><br>
I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that the National Trust has suffered for some time from the vendetta carried on by a powerful group of newspapers which are always saying that the National Trust is for the benefit of the country house owner. They deliberately obscure the fact that it is a cardinal principle with us to open these houses to the public wherever possible, and that means in nearly every case. That is serious enough, but it would be far worse if this Bill were to get the name, as far as the taxpayer is concerned, of a sort of country gentleman's charter. That is the last thing we want, and we have adopted a very simple way which would enable the Minister to make it clear that this was the object in mind.<br><br>
We quite realise that there must be cases where it is necessary to limit public access, and there may be cases where there can be no public access at all, at any rate for a time, but it is of paramount importance that these words should appear in the Bill somewhere, because, at the moment, there is no mention in the Bill of the words "public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 552</span>
access." The taxpayer wants to know what <i>quid pro quo</i> he is getting in this Bill. It is in the interest of the Minister himself to tell him in terms in the Bill.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Barnett Stross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. I feel that the Committee should be very cautious in this matter. If we do not press for these words we shall be liable to be attacked and told that we are creating a new group of pensioners. That is just the thing that we must not allow to be laid against us in turning this Bill into an Act. The words "new group of pensioners" were the very words which Sir Stafford Cripps used to some of us when he asked us in July three years ago to support steps to preserve historic buildings and places, and when he hoped that the subject would soon be brought before the House and action would be taken as a matter of urgency.<br><br>
Sir Stafford Cripps then said, and it is true, that the last thing we must do is to have a great group of museums. We do not want that; we want living interests. It might be argued by the Minister that living interests in some of these homes might preclude the public. That is not a good argument. We are dealing with the house itself and the grounds. It may not be convenient to allow access, except on special occasions, inside the house, and on the other hand it may be very much easier at the same time to allow access to the grounds and gardens.<br><br>
In any case, the Minister has power to determine the point, and the words proposed in this Amendment at least represent our good intentions. They offer a <i>quid pro quo</i> to the taxpayers. We say that we wish to preserve the grounds or the house or both because of their historic interest, because they are gems of architecture or of planning, and in return for his money the taxpayer will be able to appreciate what the house and grounds are like. Obviously we cannot do that without having access. I hope that the Minister will not find these words difficult and will accept them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Hinchingbrooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I took careful note of the Parliamentary Secretary's words that the Government were not feeling it impossible to accept this Amendment and I was glad to hear him say that the other Amendment which contained more stringent provisions would tie the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 553</span>
Minister down unduly. I hope that the Government will think again about this matter and consider the words in this Amendment. They are a very slight phrase indeed. The Minister has full power to exclude the public in appropriate cases. Nobody can brandish a copy of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, with the words of the Amendment in it and say, "We must go in. Nobody can stop us."<br><br>
It is always open to the Minister to make appropriate arrangements on the spot, and I think that the public will accept that. There is tremendous force in what has been said from the benches opposite, that there should appear in this Bill, which is for the preservation of these great houses, mention of not the public right of user but of the stage which we have reached of public education and enlightment and obvious enjoyment of so many of these houses. That the public have no right to enter is quite clear; that they demand no right to enter is, in my experience, even more clear. But that we should somehow epitomise the state of public democracy by mentioning these words in the Bill is extremely appropriate and I hope that the Government will give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should be extremely grateful to the noble Lord the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) for his contribution. I hope that in the light of what he has said with such dignity and responsibility, the Government will reconsider the points which have been raised. I thought that the Bill was non-controversial because there is no suggestion of relief by the remission of taxation and because the right or possibility of public access to these buildings and lands is explicit in the Bill. This Amendment is so reasonableâ€”indeed, it is rather too mild for some of us on this side of the Committeeâ€”that we think that the Government might quite easily accept it, particularly in the light of what the noble Lord has said so courteously and so responsibly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. M. F. Vane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the words "public access" should come somewhere in this Bill, if not in this Amendment. It is going to work out that fairly substantial sums of money will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
spent on a rather limited number of buildings which will probably be inhabited houses. Although, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, the Minister must have powers to see that the conditions fit the particular building, and if need be limit or even exclude public access, I should have thought that as a general rule it was an aim of the Bill to see that the words "public access" come somewhere.<br><br>
My noble Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) lives in a house which is possibly the kind of house which, if it were not in a good condition, might come under the purview of a Historic Buildings Council. I live in a house which has no architectural merit under this Bill but which people often come to see, and that gives one great pleasure. I think that most people would welcome access, provided it was non-obligatory and not for 24 hours a day and seven days a week. I believe that the general public would welcome it if the words of this Amendment appeared in the Bill. The words would help them to understand the real purpose of the Bill and would help avoid misunderstandings that might arise and might do great harm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Snow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As has been said from this side of the Committee, the public are rather susceptible to some of the views put forward by certain groups of newspapers and have a right to be protected against a certain type of person who happens to possess a house in this category. I should like to underline the remarks which have been made about the noble Lord the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) because I visited his house without his knowledge some time ago. I should like to pay tribute to the very generous way in which the public are allowed to visit the house and see its contents. On that occasion I was informed by the bailiff that the noble Lord was working in the kitchen garden, and I thought that the interest of national food production justified that I should not interrupt him.<br><br>
I believe that just as in the case of beautiful gardens in England, the public are becoming more and more conscious that at certain times those gardens can be visited, so there is going to be increased demand from various sections to visit these houses. There are certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 555</span>
types of schools, for instance, which very properly make a speciality of showing their students beautiful things and beautiful places. Headmistresses and headmasters of these schools are beginning to realise what opportunities there may be. I think, therefore, that to that extent they should (be protected where they know of a house within reasonable travelling distance of the school which should be seen. They should be put in the position where, within reasonable limits, they are sure that these houses can be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain J. A. L. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Clause states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"a grant â€¦ may be made subject to such conditions as the Minister may think fit to impose."</p></blockquote>
The Amendment seeks to emphasise one thing at the expense of others. It seems to me that this is merely a question of words and not of meaning, because it is quite obvious to both sides of the Committee that the Government mean to allow public access. I am not a lawyer but I am told by lawyers that if one specifically mentions one condition one may lessen the value of other conditions. It seems to me that there may be many cases where the other conditions may be just as important as this one of public access. Therefore, although I entirely agree with the purpose of the Amendment, I am a little doubtful about the effect of it.<br><br>
I want to draw the attention of the Committee to two kinds of cases where public access may be undesirable, whereas the other conditions may be more desirable. One is a case where a public body or a local authority take over one of these buildings, it may be for a secret purpose. There might be very stringent conditions about the upkeep of the buildings, because we all know what the Services are when they get into one of these buildings. It may be very undesirable from a national point of view to allow the public into the buildings.<br><br>
The second case is a type in Scotland which I have in mind, where there is a group of properties, perhaps round an old village cross. An example is Culross, Fife, where there is an old market cross surrounded by beautiful historic cottages. Obviously we want to preserve those. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 556</span>
would seem undesirable to allow public access inside those individual houses and it may be that other conditions in the interests of preserving that type of house are very much more important. I leave this point with some doubt in my mind about the wisdom of the Amendment, though in the main I entirely agree with its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of Works (Sir David Eccles)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might be allowed to try to make a conciliatory gesture, but first of all I should like to thank hon. Members for the way in which they have spoken on this Amendment. As I tried to make clear on Second Reading, there is, of course, no difference between the Government and any Member of the Committee. Certainly we feel that the main purpose of the Bill is to increase the instruction and pleasure of the public The only question was whether it was right to put these proposed words in the Bill. It is obviously the wish of the Committee that the words "public access" should appear in this Clause.<br><br>
I am not quite sure about the Amendment as drafted because of the word "and." It might be construed to mean, if I accepted the Amendment exactly as it is, that unless the condition of public access was granted I could not insert other conditions. I think, therefore, that the Parliamentary draftsmen should have a look at the Amendment and we wilt undertake to put down words on the Report stage which will bring in "public access" and what hon. Members mean.<br><br>
I should like to say a few words in reply to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Dr. Stross). He is quite right, of course, in saying that we want families to go on living in these houses and we want them to open these houses to the public. Only last week an owner said to me very sadly, but I am sure truly, that the public preferred to see his toothbrush to his Titian. That may well be the fact at the beginning, but one of the purposes of the Bill is gradually to teach people to prefer Titian to the toothbrush. I assure hon. Members that our intention is to widen the scope for expeditions, education, picnics and all that sort of thing as a result of the Bill. If the hon. Member will be good enough to withdraw his Amendment, I will put down another Amendment on the Report stage.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 557</span>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to thank the Minister for having come into line, as I think he himself has sensed, with the general feeling of both sides of the Committee. For my part, provided the words "public access" are in the Bill as a flag, so to speak, hoisted on the castle, I am quite willing to consider alternative forms of words. We thought the Amendment in my name, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Blenkinsop), would give the Minister reasonable freedom, which we all agree he should have, but it is always better to take the judgment of Parliamentary draftsmen, the principle being agreed. While reserving our right on the Report stage to comment on any alternative form of words, I suggest that my hon. Friend might be prepared to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. R. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all sure that all I want is a flag on the highest turret of the highest castle. I want something more of a reality, something more of the right of access of our people to these buildings. When I first looked at the Amendments, I frankly preferred that in page 3, line 15, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher). It seems to me that the real issue in this Bill is whether or not the ordinary man in the street, the ordinary member of the public, will have the right of access here. It is a question of nobody being able to prevent him, if he desires, from seeing these places of historic interest, within reason and at reasonable times. This is the test of our sincerity in the Bill.<br><br>
I notice that one or two hon. Members opposite think almost on the same lines but with different reasons. The hon. and gallant Member for Angus, South (Captain Duncan) suggested that the Amendment would introduce restriction, and I agree with him. I do not want that restriction; within reason, I want complete freedom. By and large, I think the public are reasonable people in these matters. I come from North Wales, and I know a number of places there of historic interest which have been taken over by the Trust, and I have never seen members of the public abusing their privileges or seeking to get into places at unreasonable times. Take the case of Caernarvon. They do not knock at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 558</span>
door at midnight saying, "I own this place; I made a contribution to the National Trust and I insist on coming in at midnight to show my authority and my rights." I have never seen that sort of thing.<br><br>
I want to see something inserted in the words of the Amendment which we are considering, or that of my hon. Friend, which will give the public the right of access to these places. Take the case of some of the smaller houses. The purpose of the Bill is to add to the amenities and the educational and cultural side of the life of our people. In one of these small places there may be a distinct type of mantelpiece or staircase, and yet, if the public are not given right of access, some person who has been assisted by this Bill may, if he desires, say, "I will not let you in. We will take the money we can get but we will not let you come in." I am not saying that anybody will do that, but they can do so if they desire. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] That is how it seems to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely if the Minister thought it appropriate, a grant could be made subject to public access. Surely the Welshman whom the hon. Member has in mind would not get the money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I still want to back this Welshman against the Minister. If he is making a contribution to these things he is entitled to right of access. The present Minister happens to be quite a reasonable sort of fellow, but it may not always be so, especially if we have more Ministers from hon. Members opposite. The public might, therefore, be denied access to places into which, in my opinion, they should be entitled to go as a matter of right. With due respect to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton), whose judgment in these things I generally follow without any question, I still feel that if we are to reconsider this matter, it cught to be, reconsidered from the point of view of making it perfectly clear that, as a matter of right, the ordinary member of the public is able to see these things which have been retained in the national interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir William Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has made his gesture in vain, for it is quite apparent that there is a strong opinion on the other side of the Committee which would introduce a kind of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0297">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 559</span>
arrogance into these matters which I think would be deplorable. An Englishman's home is his castle, even if he does get a small instalment from the State towards its preservation. This outrageous proposal that the public should have a right of accessâ€”the hon. Member says not at any time, but in fact it will be at any timeâ€”and should unpleasantly demand access to private houses and the like, is in my opinion quite intolerable. I think the Minister should stand by his Clause imposing such conditions as "he may think fit."<br><br>
I have in mind a place of this character which is used as a bus stop. If the public have the right to enter at night, to look at the mantelpiece, to use the lavatories â€”if that is the position which would follow the outrageous demands of the hon. Member for Droylsden (Mr. W. R. Williams)â€”then I, for one, prefer to rest with the Minister. I know of another case in Scotland where an enterprising bus companyâ€”and I am not one to discourage bus companiesâ€”have taken large numbers of persons to comparatively insignificant places ostensibly to show this curiosity of the past but actually to stimulate the sales of ice cream and other things in an adjacent cafe. That is the kind of thing involved in giving the public which the hon. Member demands.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to withdraw his generous gesture. He will be the best judge not only of the public right but also of the rights of the individual who, for a small instalment, has given up to the public a very great deal of his privileges. I hope the Ministry will stand fast to this Clause because there is a viciousness which seems to animate the minds of at least certain of the Welsh hon. Members opposite. Graciousness, generosity, willingness to compromise, are thrown away in vain. I hope the Ministry will stand fast on his suggestion. These are valuable houses, but without a great many people eager and willing at reasonable times to show them to the public, then the whole service demanded as a right will break down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for not having been here at the beginning of the debate but, as there is an Amendment on the Order Paper in my name, I want to make these comments. In view of what I understand the Minister has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 560</span>
said, I am prepared not to press my Amendment at this stage but to reserve my right to argue it on Report.<br><br>
May I make this reply to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Sir W. Darling)? We all agree with the sentiment that an Englishman's home is his castle, but there is another principle operating hereâ€”that where public money is being used, the public must have certain rights. Where public money is being used for the benefit of the upkeep of houses in which people live, then in my view it must be one of the conditions that the public have right of access. It would be intolerable if public money were used for the preservation and upkeep of historic buildings in which private individuals continued to live unless it were a clearly accepted principle, written into the Bill, that that gave a corresponding right to members of the public to have access to the buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has obviously not heard what was said by his own Front Bench.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: T said I was not here at the beginning, and I am expressing my own point of view. With great respect for any point of view which may have been expressed elsewhere, I am speaking for myself and stating principles which I believe to be accepted. I do not want to press the matter further at this stage, but I will press it further on Report unless I am satisfied with the Amendment which the Minister puts down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to pour oil on troubled watersâ€”waters which until recently I thought were very smooth. It should be made clear that we on this side of the Committee appreciate the generous gesture of the Minister in having agreed to a form of words which will include the word "access." The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Sir W. Darling) need not be so worried. After all, he need not accept the grant if it will involve a bus driver and others going in and out, eating ice cream. If there is anything he does not like he need not accept the grant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He does not know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he does want the grant and if there are so many people eating ice cream and so many drivers that his rights are disturbed, it rests with

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 561</span>
the Minister to grant him some alleviation in due course, if he wishes to do so. The Minister has powers to do so. It seems to me perfectly easy for the Minister to choose to which houses the public shall have access and to which they shall not. He has been granted sufficient powers, and if he uses them well, as I am sure he will, there should be no trouble whatever for people like the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South. I hope the Minister will not be led up that garden path but will follow the path he has followed so far. That will give satisfaction to everyone on this side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. W. Sorensen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that we seem likely to accept the wise rather than generous offer of the Minister. I understand the objection of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Sir W. Darling). Apparently he wants to preserve his prehistoric cabin and public money to be used to preserve it without any kind of return to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I only want to limit certain uses of the historic houses for the purpose of the individual living there. I want him to be able to use his gardens, his lavatories, his tools, the minor articles which decorate his mantelpiece. I want to preserve them for his personal use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sorensen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member moves an Amendment stating that lavatories and such things should be excluded, I should support it, but I took it that what he wanted was to preserve his prehistoric cabin and all the amenities therein at public expense without giving any kind of return whatever. That is a very interesting revelation of his mentality which we will remember in future when he deals with questions of public economy and the waste of public money.<br><br>
Meanwhile, may I say that I hope very earnestly that we will accept the Minister's suggestion. I am quite prepared to accept his assurance that he will bring this provision into the Bill in the right way. I hope he will not interpret the Amendment literally so that every house must have flying over it the banner "Public Access." I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Droylsden (Mr. W. R. Williams), who suggests that the Amendment of my hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 562</span>
Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher) is better, for I see this difficulty: sometimes what it is desired to preserve is not so much the interior of the building as the exterior.<br><br>
In that case it would be rather unfair if the money were devoted to preserving the outside appearance of the building and it were then required that that should carry with it a necessity for the public to visit the inside, of, perhaps, some ancient cottage. I am sure he will bear that in mind. We desire to ensure that, wherever public money is spent, there shall be, within the Minister's discretion, public access to the part of the building upon which public money has been spent. Because I believe the Minister bears that well in mind, I and my hon. Friends are prepared to leave the matter with him in the hope that on the Report stage we shall be given appropriate words to deal with the need.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 15, after "may," to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the appropriate Council."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends and I feel that the conditions which the Minister may wish to make will vary greatly according to the circumstances brought out in the debate that we have just had. Although we are thinking and talking today largely about great houses, we must remember that the Bill extends far beyond that. It covers historic buildings, and they can be of all kinds.<br><br>
I believe that the Minister is anxious that the appropriate Historic Buildings Council shall be brought very intimately into the business of advising him about buildings deserving of help, and I believe they should also be brought in on the question of conditions. It would be a pity if we left any loopholes so that the Minister or his successors might be accused of undue patronage. In the same way as the Minister will be advised by the Historic Buildings Council about buildings deserving of aid with their repairs, so the Council should be brought into this other question, one most important facet of which is whether access by the public shall for some good reason be excluded or not.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 563</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can accept the principle of the Amendment. Indeed, on Second Reading I said that I hoped that, when the case came back from the Historic Buildings Council after they have looked at the reports and the estimates of cost, they would then recommend the nature of the grant and the conditions to be attached to it. So we have always had it in mind that they would, as it were, take the initiative about some of the conditions.<br><br>
I am afraid that we cannot accept the wording of the Amendment. The main reason is that we do not want the word "appropriate." We are making some other Amendments to meet the Scottish National Trust, and occasionally we may make emergency grants, for which we have taken power, and when we make an emergency grant there are bound to be some conditions to it which for the time being the Minister will have to impose without consulting the Council. If my hon. Friend will withdraw his Amendment, I will put down one on the Report stage which will cover his principle and bring in the emergency grant point.</span></p>

I hope the purpose of this Amendment is clear. The words add nothing to the clarity or sense of the Clause, and they are superfluous and even tautological. The Amendment was moved in the interests of brevity and, I hope, good drafting, and it is perhaps fitting that I move it briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel strongly about it, but I rather like the words. It is important to make it clear that the Minister must have the final word about the conditions. Of course, he will consult the Councils, but there will be aspects of a wide nature. There will be the public interest, and we shall sometimes be talking to a local authority about its buildings. There will, no doubt, be many occasions when the Minister will have to add something to the conditions over and above what has been recommended to him by the Council. The words "think
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 564</span>
fit to" are helpful in making clear the Minister's position. It is very dangerous ground to tread on, but my view, as opposed to that of the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson), is that the rhythm and music of the sentence are better with the words "think fit to." However, it is not on grounds of euphony that I ask the Committee to resist the Amendment but because I believe it brings out the intention of the subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister really persist in resisting this effort to make an economy, no matter how small, in public expenditure on printing, which has grown monstrously in the last year or so? Would he impose a condition unless he thought it a fit condition to impose? Of course not. Every condition he imposes he will impose because he thinks it is a fit condition to impose. I beg him to accept this in the interests of brevity. As to rhythms, differences of view are held. Surely these words do nothing and should go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be obstinate, but I believe the words do add something. After all, brevity is not the only consideration; sometimes a little grace, a little flourish, helps us to do what we want to do. I advise the Committee to let the words stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. K. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not press the Amendment. I do not feel very strongly about it, either. Although I am completely unconvinced by any of the right hon. Gentleman's arguments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

On re-examination, we found it somewhat doubtful whether the Minister would be able to acquire amenity land otherwise than at the same time as he acquired the building.

If "National Trust" is the only term used in the Bill, people in Scotland may confuse the issue, thinking that the National Trust is one body, and then the National Trust of Scotland will be forgotten in respect of both public interest and public subscription. We are most grateful to my right hon. Friend for bringing Scotland more fully into the picture. Not only will this be more

<br><blockquote><p>Provided that this subsection shall not apply in a case where the making of a grant appears to the Minister to be a matter of immediate urgency.</p></blockquote>
The effect of this Amendment is to require the Minister to consult with the Council except in cases of emergency before making a grant to a local authority or one of the National Trusts to assist in the purchase of historic buildings. I think this is a natural Amendment to add to the Bill, since we have widened the scope of the Historic Buildings Councils under Clause 1, and I hope the Committee will see fit to accept it.</span></p>

I gather you have not called it, Mr. Hynd, because it is outside the scope of the Financial Resolution. The purpose of this Clause is to enable the Minister to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 567</span>
reimburse the National Trust where it is more appropriate that the Trust should acquire a property than that he should acquire the property and hand it over to the National Trust. It occurred to the National Trust that probably his intention was to extend this principle to cover associated land and associated chattels. That is what our Amendment sought to do.<br><br>
It is outside the Financial Resolution, but I would be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman could say whether there is any way of making this very small extension to which I am sure he would have no objection. It would be a matter of convenience, nothing more, and I hope he will consider it between now and the Report stage. It is always possible for him to acquire land and chattels and hand them over to the National Trust. I would be grateful to know whether there is any way of making this small extension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the Amendment to which the hon. Member refers was outside the Financial Resolution, but I do not think that that need worry the hon. Gentleman, because in Clause 5 we have the power to do exactly what was proposed in the Amendments not selected; that is to say, we can buy chattels and give them to the National Trust in respect of houses which they are taking over. We have only a moment or two ago accepted three little Amendments for the clarification of Clause 5, which expressly makes it clear that we have power to buy amenity land separate from a house. So we can do what the hon. Gentleman wants, and I think that the best way is to leave it to the Minister and the National Trust to exercise, in a sensible way, the wide powers they have under Clause 5 in regard to any particular house.<br><br>
If we had accepted the Amendment, it would have raised a point which we shall be discussing on the next Clause. If land is purchased and it is given to a house, the house is being endowed. This is a point which it would be better to discuss on the next Clause, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are not going to ask the National Trust to take a house with nothing in it, if there is anything which can go with it and make it into a desirable building to preserve for the public.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. K. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 25, after "six," to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"and section (Endowments to National Trust)."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment seems to be linked up with the proposed new Clause, "Endowments to National Trust":
<br><blockquote><p>Where a building which appears to the Minister to be of outstanding historic or architectural interest is, or is to be, vested in the National Trust, the Minister may, out of moneys paid to him out of the National Land Fund, transfer to the National Trust part or all of such capital sum as, in the opinion of the National Trust, is necessary to provide an adequate income for the repair and maintenance of such building, or for the upkeep of any land held with and forming part of the amenities thereof, or for the repair or maintenance of any objects ordinarily kept in such building.</p></blockquote>
We might discuss them together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that would be convenient to the Committee.<br><br>
The purpose of the proposed new Clause is to enable the Minister to provide an endowment to the National Trust, or to supplement an endowment in respect of a property acquired or to be acquired by the National Trust, out of the Â£500,000 allocation from the National Land Fund which he is going to get under this Bill. Under the National Trust country house scheme, the Trusts have been able over the last 15 years or so to preserve something over 100 houses.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0302">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 569</span>
In all these cases there have been endowments provided normally by the owner who, occasionally, from outside sources endowed the building in the form of a capital sum of money providing an income sufficient to maintain the property or endowment in the form of land bringing in an income from agricultural leases and production of all kinds, again sufficient to enable the maintenance to be carried on.<br><br>
The National Trust has little or no fund to provide endowments from its own resources. Where the owner is not in a position to provide adequate endowment at the same time as he gives the house to the Trust, we have in some cases been able to get sums of money from an organisation like the Pilgrim Trust. In spite of that, we have over the last few years had to let go over 30 thoroughly admirable properties, in every way up to the National Trust's standards, for the sole reason that the endowment could not be provided either by the owner or from outside sources. We have found in most cases that the owner is able and willing to put up part of the endowment. It is a question of finding an adequate capital sum which will enable maintenance to be carried on permanently, indeed, in perpetuity.<br><br>
We raised this matter with the hon. Gentleman in the early stages of this Bill. It was raised on Second Reading, and I thought that the Minister, on the whole, was sympathetic with the idea. He did say that he had offered to the Trust annual maintenance grants in respect of buildings acquired by them over a period or for an indefinite period, and that was a very welcome compromise. The trouble is that it is not adequate for National Trust security.<br><br>
The annual grant, whatever terms it is given on, is always subject to a possible reduction in the future. It is axiomatic that no Government can bind their successors, and we have had the experience that in times of stringency, culture is usually one of the first casualties. It seems so much easier for a Government, faced with financial difficulties or an economic crisis, to cut expenditure on cultural objectives. They are regarded, at any rate during those times, as luxuries. It is always hoped, I believe, that these
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 570</span>
economies can be made with the minimum protest and opposition from the House.<br><br>
We had an example only last year in the cutting of the grants to museums, although I do not think the right hon. Gentleman would agree that that went through without any protest. It is for these reasons that the attempt on the part of the right hon. Gentleman to meet the Trust point is not adequate. It is not adequate because there is only one way in which we can ensure the permanent preservation of any of these historic houses that come to us, and that is by declaring it inalienable. On the strength of a Government grant which could be reduced or eliminated at any time, however excellent are the intentions of the Minister originally making the grant, we would not be justified in declaring one of these buildings inalienable.<br><br>
What are the Minister's objections to the principle embodied in this new Clause? I do not think they are his objections; they are the objections of his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He said on Second Reading that the Chancellor felt that this would be too great a departure from financial principle. Again, the Parliamentary Secretary said he doubted whether the proposal would commend itself to the Public Accounts Committee. Why is this a departure from financial principle?<br><br>
Already there have been handed over to the National Trust from the National Land Fund properties which have been accepted by the Exchequer, and by the Inland Revenue in lieu of death duties, and in certain cases they have had an endowment in the form of land. I think I am right in saying that Cotehele was one of them, and if it is appropriate in those cases to hand over land which brings in an income sufficient to enable the Trust to maintain the property in perpetuity, what is the objection to agreeing to make provision for endowments in either form?<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the Public Accounts Committee. I can give the Minister an assurance that the National Trust is very willing to meet all requirements not only of the Public Accounts Committee but of the Estimates Committee. One of these endowments could be made under the terms of this new Clause. The Trust has always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0303">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 571</span>
provided separate accounting every year in respect of each individual property, and it would be prepared to provide all information in the shape of estimates and accounts to the appropriate Committees of the House.<br><br>
Finally, I want to emphasise that this Clause is only permissive. We realise that there is not very much money available this year. We have great hopes that there will be more available in time to come, but the National Trust feels that unless it can get the principle established that the Minister is permitted to make endowments, and to get it included in this Bill, there will not be another occasion for heaven knows how long.<br><br>
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that if he agrees to this new Clause he will not be bombarded by the Trust every time a property comes along and the owner is not able to give an adequate endowment. We realise that the amount of money available is not very large at the moment, and there is not a great deal that can be done, but we think that that is an economical way to use the taxpayers' money to preserve houses. In this way we bring the owner into the picture.<br><br>
The owner always makes a contribution. In the first place, he gives the property, and usually he is prepared to offer a sum for endowment purposes. All we need in many cases is a supplementary endowment, for which I should have thought the National Land Fund was ideally suited, and which I believe certainly was within the ideals of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) when he set up the Fund.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
We think that with the money available on this basis, more houses can be preserved. The National Trust are being asked to co-operate with the Minister's Department in the administration of this Bill to a far greater extent than hon. Members realise. We have not asked very much in return, but there were many points on which the Trust would have liked to have inspired Amendments in this Committee. In the general desire to get the Bill through, we have desisted, and this is the only major point of substance which I am putting forward on behalf of the National Trust.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 572</span>
We feel very strongly about it. We are sure that it is in the general interest of the preservation of historic houses, as well as in the public interest, that this power should be in the Bill, and, though we all want to hasten the progress of this Bill to the Statute Book, I feel we must press this particular Amendment.<br><br>
I now want to say a word or two about the Ulster Land Fund, which was set up at about the same time as my right hon. Friend founded the National Land Fund in this country. The Ulster Land Fund is a very much smaller affair, and I believe that, in the capital sum involved, it bears the same ratio to our capital sum as the Ulster population does to that of the rest of the United Kingdom. In Ulster they have found no difficulty whatever in providing endowments for the National Trust, and there have been three specific cases in which endowments of Â£30,000, Â£25,000 and Â£7,000 have been granted in respect of houses in Northern Ireland. I should have thought that, if they find it possibleâ€”and, after all, their financial principles are based upon the principles of this Houseâ€”the right hon. Gentleman would have no difficulty in accepting the proposal or in persuading his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br><br>
This is the one thing which the National Trust asks in return for the cooperation which they are only too pleased to give to the right hon. Gentleman in the administration of the Bill, and I earnestly ask him to look at it carefully and sympathetically, and to tell the Committee that he is able to accept this permissive power, even though we all realise that there is nothing very much that can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman moving the new Clause with the addition of an "s" at the end of the word Trust?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No; I have no doubt that on the Report stage all these matters of drafting can be put right, and I am sorry to have erred in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Nicolson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Sir Edward Keeling), who is ill, I should like to support the new Clause in the name of the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) who, of course, is a member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0304">Image</span>

of many of the National Trust Committees. So is my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham, but I am not, and so I speak as a complete outsider who gives his full support to the objectives contained in this Clause. They really amount to two central arguments, both of which have been very well expressed by the hon. Gentleman opposite.<br><br>
First, when the National Trust accept a property from a private owner, they are saying to that owner "We will maintain your house in perpetuity," but they cannot make that promise to any owner unless absolutely certain that they will have the money with which to maintain the property in perpetuity. For that reason, in very many cases in the past, the National Trust have been obliged to turn down several houses which they would very much like to have accepted, but could not do so, because the presentation of the house was not accompanied by a sufficient endowment. They are asking from the Government that, when they make a promise of perpetual preservation, they should receive the equivalent guarantee from the Government itself. They ask that it should not be left to the whims of successive Governments whether to continue these grants, which may be made annually or for specific repairs.<br><br>
There may be in the future a change to a Government such as we have never seen in this country, which might be thoroughly opposed to all use of public funds for such purposes as this Bill envisages, and, in such cases, the Trust would like to have a sum which cannot be touched by any future generations but which will go towards the permanent upkeep of the house.<br><br>
The second reason for the new Clause is that if it is accepted, it would save the Government money and many more houses than could be saved under the Bill as at present drafted. If an owner is able to provide half the endowment sum necessary to maintain the house, the National Trust cannot accept it, because they cannot provide the other half. So the house is allowed to go into ruin, simply because the Trust are, say, Â£50,000 short. The alternative would be for the Government to take such a house completely under their own care under Part I of the Bill, and either buy it outright out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 574</span>
of the Â£500,000 or maintain it annually out of the Â£250,000.<br><br>
In either case, if they use the National Trust as an agency, allowing the Trust to accept half the endowment sum from the owner, and then provide a transfer to the Trust for the other half, everybody will gain. The owner will gain, the Treasury will gain and the country will gain, and the house itself will be preserved.<br><br>
For that reason, I sincerely hope that my right hon. Friend may find it possible to introduce on Report some such Clause as this, which will give effect to the requirements we have in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for coming late to this Committee, but I had to attend another Committee meeting this morning.<br><br>
I think the arguments for this Amendment have been cogently stated by the hon. Member who moved it and by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East and Christchurch (Mr. Nicolson). On Second Reading, I expressed some sympathy with the point of view of the Minister and his suggestion that annual grants would meet the problem of upkeep. Upkeep is undoubtedly the main problem in connection with ancient monuments or fine houses, which the Bill seeks to preserve, but, on thinking over the matter, I am less impressed by the Minister's arguments.<br><br>
I think it is a very valid point against the system of grants that no Government can bind its successor. I think it will also increase the difficulties of the Ministry of Works if they have to assess from time to time, and even from year to year, the amount of the grants which may be necessary. It might be more convenient if the Ministry made a lump sum available, and then placed the responsibility on the National Trusts for all time.<br><br>
I would ask the Minister fully to grasp the position in which the National Trust will be placed, because they will be in a very difficult position. If an owner comes to the Trust and offers a certain endowment for his house, and all that the Trust can say is, "That is not enough; the rest will have to be given by the Government, but we cannot bind ourselves that the Government will continue the grant." That is a very relevant point, and I do not see what the Trust are going to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0305">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 575</span>
in reply. I would also stress the point that owners should be in a position in which they are almost compelled to make some endowment themselves. They are nearly always willing to do so, but if they think that the Minister will take over their house in any case, they might well leave him the whole burden, although I do not think many will. The satisfactory thing about the National Trust arrangements is that there is a partnership; we get the continuing interest of the family in the responsibility for the upkeep of the house, and the balance of the cost made up, perhaps by the Trust and perhaps from the receipts from the public. I should be very sorry to see that position radically altered.<br><br>
Then there is the question of inalienability. The authority of the Trust is given by Act of Parliament. I do not think Parliament would want to see a great deal of money going towards the upkeep of houses of which the Trust could dispose if they became so minded. On taking over a house, the Trust is bound to declare it "alienable" or "inalienable." Normally, houses which are worth the attention of the Government should be held inalienably, but then adequate upkeep must be provided for all time.<br><br>
Finally there is the point about the amount of money available. The Minister argues that the Bill provides a small amount of public money, and that he wants to keep control over its disposal, but I think there are two or three arguments against that. First, what is happening to this great Land Fund? Many of us still feel that no proper explanation why more use is not made of this fund has been given, and it is a perfectly proper question. The Government may not want to use the money for this purpose, but, surely, they have some idea what they want it for?<br><br>
Secondly, I am less impressed now by the argument that the Ministry of Works have very little money. I thought in the Second Reading debate that there was a strong argument for limiting the amount of money which can be spent on unique monuments or beautiful houses. Today, however, I read that the Ministry have spent Â£140,000 on Lancaster House. This seems to me extraordinaryâ€”Â£140,000 on a building which is not particularly beautiful, compared with the amount
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 576</span>
provided in this Bill for the preservation of all the beautiful and historic buildings in Britain. It is all the more extraordinary coming from a Government which nightly preaches economy.<br><br>
The Government need have no fear that the Trusts will waste their money. There is still some confusion as to the nature of the Trusts. Both the Trusts are highly responsible bodies, but I still think there is some misapprehension about their nature. Some people think of them as being a branch of the Government; that is quite untrue. They are much more economical than any Government Department would be. Again, some people think that they are a sort of aristocratic society of property owners, but that is also untrue, for they are widely representative. I cannot speak for the English Trust, but, certainly, in the Scottish National Trust there are representatives of trade unions and all sections of society. It is extremely unlikely to be a body which, having built up a reputation, is going to act in an improper way in the use of public funds.<br><br>
I believe that the grants system is not often used for capital purposes. I think there are very few bodies that get capital grants from the Government, but there are circumstances in which people are allowed to use money provided by the Government for capital purposes. Some bodies are at least allowed to carry over the balance of their annual grants from year to year. I suggest that, on the grounds of economy and getting the job doneâ€”unless there is some technical objection which has not so far been advanced by the Governmentâ€”there are considerable arguments in favour of the Amendment. It would enable the Government to do what they want to do as cheaply as possible.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the Estates Committee of the National Trust, and it would ease one's task a great deal if the Minister could go some way towards meeting the point of this Amendment, even if he cannot go the whole hog. I was very glad to hear the character which was given us by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), and, although the hon. Gentleman referred to the Scottish Trust, I think the English one can justifiably claim that we reflect the same good qualities.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0306">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 577</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would include the English Trust in anything complimentary which I said. I only spoke of the Scottish Trust because I know its work. I did declare my interest on Second Reading; I am a member of the Council of the National Trust for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be very loth to see the National Trust ever become a pensioner of any Government, because the whole spirit of the National Trust and the quality of the service which they can provide derive from their independence, and that means that they cannot and must not look to any Government for any major part of their financial resources.<br><br>
If they were to do so, I think that they would find that they had sold their soul. I do not think that in this Amendment we are in fact putting ourselves in that dangerous position, because it is only in a number of special cases that the Ministry of Works might find it appropriate to give and the National Trust might find it appropriate to receive a sum of money in endowment for a particular building.<br><br>
During this debate we have tended once again to talk only about large houses. We have assumed that they are still owned by persons of considerable means who might be expected to give a substantial part of the endowment, if not all. But the National Trust are not only concerned with the houses. That is only one of the smaller parts of their great functions and duties as seen by the original founders. I should like the Committee to consider such things as mills and bridges which may have great architectural qualities and which might possibly be given to the Trust if only there were a certain sum of money to endow.<br><br>
A bridge can be a very expensive thing if its foundations have begun to be washed away, and some historic mill at the end of a village might be in danger of demolition and of being lost for ever. It might not be the property of anyone in a position to endow it at all. It might be the function of the Ministry of Works in a special case to endow a property of that sort, though I should be loth to see the Trust going to the Ministry for Â£50,000 and the Ministry having to give it every time.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 578</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very interesting matter. I well understand the view of the National Trust but I think that we should try to look at the matter on a wider basis than we have done so far. If we had unlimited money there would be a great deal to be said even for endowment and even with Â£50 million burning a hole in the Chancellor's pocketâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Â£55 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the exact figure. In fact, it is something over Â£50 million, but never mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the exact figure, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even with that money, which constitutes one of the main reasons why hon. Members are anxious to use the method of endowment to prise open the National Land Fund, I do not think we should accept that principle. The object of the Bill is to provide the means of keeping in good repair a number of outstanding buildings. For that purpose an annual income on a secure basis is required to provide that the income is obtained. The source is really not of very much importance. It can come from one or two places, either from money which Parliament finds annually or from the interest on a capital sum.<br><br>
To constitute a capital sum requires something between 25 and 30 times the income, to be set aside at one stroke. The answer to the point about Northern Ireland, which was raised by the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson), is that there are very few houses that they wish to assist and in relation to the number of historic houses for which grants are asked they have a great deal of money in their fund. They, therefore, have taken this course, but we need not necessarily do what Northern Ireland does. We have a different situation here because the number of properties here is so much greater.<br><br>
Clearly the sums which the Chancellor feels able to make available for the purposes of the Bill at present are too small to contemplate their use as endowments. A sum of Â£500,000 over five years would go nowhere if we started to use it as a means of making endowments. Then it is said that we can get more out of the National Land Fund and that this is an excellent way to do it. Even there I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0307">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 579</span>
think that the arithmetic is not so favourable as one might suppose. A sum of Â£50 million yields annually between Â£1,500,000 and Â£2 million. That is less than one-fifth of what we have calculated it would cost to carry out annually the whole of the recommendations of the Gowers Commitee.<br><br>
It seems to me that, looking into the future, it would be wiser to get as much money as we can from the Land Fund to buy property. I hope also that I shall be allowed to use money from the Land Fund to pay for arrears of repairs when a property is bought or taken over. But I think that it would not be sensible to tie up the Land Fund money in the form of endowments, because we should find that the portion of it which any Chancellor in the years ahead might be willing to use for the purposes of this Bill would disappear at a very high speed, since Â£100,000 produces annually Â£3,500. Because very little use has been made so far of the Land Fund, I think that it is a mistake to plump for using it in this way if the alternative is open to us that after we have used our Â£500,000 we should get some more from the Land Fund for the purpose of making purchases.<br><br>
I would interject here that, of course, it is not the house that will cost the money; it is the land, and still more the chattels. Hon. Members might figure to themselves what a collection of pictures is worth if there are half-a-dozen masterpieces in it. That is where I think the money will go at a rapid rate, if we are allowed to have it, and I think that that is the best way to use the money. In our view it is a good thing to start work under this Bill on a modest scale and see where we go and then come back for more money when we have shown that we know how to use well the capital money at the start.<br><br>
Then there is the problem of long-term security of income. It is that which troubles the National Trusts but it is we who have brought the National Trusts into this Bill at all. It is only because we have felt that it was a good thing to use them as our agents that they have appeared in the picture of historic buildings preservation. As I have said downstairs, we know already that quite a number of houses are coming to us which we cannot put into the National Trusts, either because the owners do not want to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 580</span>
be in the National Trust system or because they want to sell the property lock, stock and barrel to the Ministry of Works.<br><br>
It is my firm desire to use the National Trusts as much as I can where we are dealing with inhabited houses, and I hope that my successors will take the same view, but there are alternative methods. There is a strong body of opinion in this country which feels that the Ministry of Works themselves ought to manage these inhabited houses as we do Chequers. I do not take that view, but I take the view that we cannot do everything that the National Trust want done.<br><br>
There are four points on this question of security of income. The first is the simple one that endowments do not provide security of income, because money depreciates and costs rise. That is the never-ending experience of all people who constitute money endowments. I quoted downstairs the case of Chequers because the accounts are published. Lord Lee of Fareham left Â£4,000 a year with Chequers and we now spend three times that sum. That is no exception and it is not possible to secure perpetuity of maintenance by putting down so many thousand pounds in Government security.<br><br>
Secondly, we believe that the assurance of grants over a period of years is a more sensible way of providing security of income, because if money depreciates and costs rise, which they always do, I feel certain that future Parliaments will find it easier to modify grants from year to year than they will endowments. It is a matter of opinion but that is how it looks to me. Anyway, the National Trusts are only concerned with an assurance of income. They will not get it from endowments, but they could get it if we promise them grants that would vary with costs every five or ten years having regard to the level of prices.<br><br>
Thirdly, it might well happen, and it does happen, that a house gets burned down or for some reason unforeseeable now ceases to be a suitable building for preservation. In that case endowment is a serious embarrassment. We have parted with our money and there is no longer anything on which to use the money. We should have to provide against that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0308">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 581</span>
The fourth point is on a much wider basis and I apologise to the Committee for bringing in a more philosophic note. I seriously doubt the wisdom of aiming to preserve for ever and ever every building that may qualify to come under this Bill. I recall the speech of the hon. Member for Gravesend (Sir R. Acland) on the Second Reading of this Bill. It must be admitted that men and their handiwork rise and fall and the attempt to preserve something for all time runs contrary to the mortality of human things. If hon. Members, with this doctrine of perpetuity or inalienable houses, are striving for immortality, which in my humble judgment they ought not to do on this earth, let them reflect. They cannot do it by endowment.<br><br>
It is certain that one cannot immortalise a house by putting down money. No one can say what it will be worth in 500 years' time. Those hon. Members who are peering into the long future and hope to see buildings preserved as they are today should think of the Roman villas of which the hon. Baronet, the Member for Gravesend spoke the other day.<br><br>
I should like those hon. Members to consider whether they would get nearer to what they desire with a system of grants that can be raised as the value of money declines rather than by endowments. Our idea is to promise to the owners or managers of a historic property, who will not always be the National Trusts, grants over a long enough period to enable them to make their plans well ahead.<br><br>
I think that we should see how we get on with Â£500,000 from the Land Fund and then, when that is exhausted, we shall go back for more to use on the purchase of historic properties. I like the suggestion that there should be a carry over, that is that if the grant is not entirely spent it should not be returnable. I will certainly look into that. It seems to me that unless we have some provision of that kind the incentive to economise will not be there. We shall have what we have in many Government Departmentsâ€”people coming in March to say, "You must spend up to your Vote or it will be cut next year."<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I hope the Committee will reject the principle of endowments. I can well see its attraction; it looks as though we are taking a step towards perpetuity and it looks as though we are getting the Ministry of Works out of the business for ever; and, no doubt, there are many people who favour that. I do not particularly want these houses managed by a Government Department. I think we would be well advised to take the experience of the National Trusts and use it. Nevertheless, we must keep some control in our hands, and I suggest that we shall make a better use of public money, and the Land Fund money in particular, if we do not tie it up in endowments but use it for purchases and seek to get lairger sums as time goes on for the annual grants. That, to my mind, gives the security of income which is sufficient for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed, as I am sure are many other hon. Members, by the Minister's speech. I want to draw his attention to the wording of the new Clause. All it proposes to do is to give him power in suitable cases to grant endowments. It says "The Minister may," not "The Minister shall," and not even "The Minister often shall." I do not think the Minister has made out a case against taking a power to do this among many other things in order to carry out the general purposes of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman think it would be honest to take a power which we did not mean to use? That is why I did not draw the Committee's attention to the fact that we were asked to do it only if we thought fit. We do not think fit, and I do not think we ought to have the power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As Englishmen so often say, each case must be judged on its merits with regard to the particular circumstances of any property, the total sum available to the Minister and the other alternatives. I certainly think that in a number of cases which are likely to arise over the next ten years he should have this power. I am not talking about perpetuity at all. If I may be allowed, I will not pursue the more philosophical later stages of the Minister's speech. We are thinking of what may happen over perhaps the next 20 years, when a large number of houses are liable to come on offer to the Trust, if the past experience
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0309">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
of the Trust can be taken as typical, as think it can.<br><br>
Suppose the Trust would very much like to accept them. Suppose they pass all the standards which would be required by the Act. Yet the Trust cannot accept them because the endowment is not sufficient. All this Clause does is to give the Minister power in his full discretionâ€”perhaps not very often, but occasionally â€”having taken everything into account, to put something into the endowment fund. It has been emphasised by speakers with knowledge of how these arise that very often the owner is able to contribute something but not enough to maintain the house in a proper condition. I should have thought that in the very broadest way it would have been advantageous to the Minister to have this power to deal with whatever money he may have in relation to the cases which may be put to him.<br><br>
I was very sorry to find creeping in, towards the end of his statement, the thought that there might be some rivalry between the Ministry of Works and the National Trust. I thought that suggested that jealousies have been generated behind the scenes which are very unworthy and undesirable. Neither of these are rivals one with the other. We on this side of the Committee, as a matter of principle, raise no objection to a great Department of State becoming the owner of certain houses. Certainly not. In so far as the right hon. Gentleman is now feeling the touch of Socialist impetus in his new Department, we have no quarrel in principle, but on the other hand we also value highly the work being done by the National Trusts and other bodies.<br><br>
When the right hon. Gentleman said that the National Trust appeared in the picture only now and because he has willed to put them in, historically that is inaccurate. The National Land Fund, which I founded with the consent of Parliament, from the very beginning brought the National Trust very fully into the picture, and a great majority of the property taken over under the operation of the Land Fund has been transferred to the two National Trusts. That in Scotland has had some. The Trusts have admirably discharged their duties.<br><br>
The Minister made no reply at all to the argument that endowments have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
already been provided in several cases. I will cite two, and I will give the details so as to bring out the point. In two cases of houses transferred under the operation of the National Land Fund to the National Trust, endowments have in fact been provided with the full approval of the Treasury. The first is the case of Cotehele. It was the first of the historic houses to be acquired under the National Land Fund by the National Trust. It was given by the Treasury in 1947 and along with it were given 1,279 acres, which are for the most part agricultural land, yielding rents and produce for the house. In that case the National Trust felt the endowment to be sufficient. Here we haveâ€”I quote from the National Trust handbookâ€”
<br><blockquote><p>"one of the best-preserved mediaeval houses in the country, built 1485â€“1539."</p></blockquote>
I understand that it is adequately endowed for the present in that way.<br><br>
The question which my hon. Friend asked and which the Minister has not answered was, what is the difference, on the one hand, between the Treasury permitting a quantity of income-yielding land to be handed over to the National Trust to yield an income and maintain the houseâ€”it is a considerable agricultural estate, right outside amenity land altogetherâ€”and, on the other hand, handing over a sum of money?<br><br>
Even more striking is the other case which has been mentioned, that of Penrhyn. The figures are very much larger and the endowment is much more substantialâ€”and here I quote from the National Land Fund's Report. This was handing over a considerable part of the Penrhyn estate to the National Trust under the operation of the National Land Fund. They say it
<br><blockquote><p>"is the largest amount paid for a purchase from the Fund since it was set up in 1946â€“47."</p></blockquote>
That was Â£200,000 paid by the Treasury for the property, and it was transferred to the Trust.<br><br>
That land, it has been made clear, is in addition to Penrhyn Castle, which I will not discuss; I will not deal with the architectural aspects except to say that according to all judgments it is beautiful and quite certainly unique. In addition, in order to maintain it, some 40,000 acres of landed property have been transferred which
<br><blockquote><p>"though stated to be of considerable amenity value, is predominantly of agricultural use."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0310">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
It also happens to includeâ€”and this appeals to me as another reason why this is a good transferâ€”a good deal of beautiful mountainous country which does not yield agricultural rent. It includes, in particular, 10 out of the 14 peaks in the Snowdonia Range over 3,000 feet above the sea. But the point I want to emphasise is that the greater part is agricultural land yielding an income. Will the Minister or some Member of the Government tell us why it is permissible in those cases, with the consent of the Treasury, for the endowment to be turned over to the Trust, while there is supposed to be some doctrinal objection to it being turned over in the case of money?<br><br>
I would like further to dwell on what the Minister said about security of income. Nothing is secure in this life at all, neither our lives nor our seats nor our incomes. All this is familiar, and some think that it adds to the attraction of public life. Let us look to the future, surrounded by all its uncertaintiesâ€”another war, an atom bomb and so on. If we are considering which is the greater riskâ€”the risk that money will depreciate or the risk that a future Government will economiseâ€”for my part I would sooner run the risk that money will depreciate. We have found constantly in the past that culture is one of the first casualties when economy campaigns are hotted up, and I believe that if we are to depend upon grants coming from year to year, liable to cancellation, we have to remember that in this field we in this Committee chiefly consist of persons who have expressed a wish to come on to the Committee because this is the kind of thing which is of interest to us. That applies to a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
In this sense, however, we are not representative, perhaps not even of the House of Commons and certainly not of the wide, outer public. I say we are running a much greater risk if we put these arrangements in the form of annual grants, if we risk a change to a Government which will economise on the grants, than if we merely risk the possibility, notable though that is, that money will continue to depreciate even under the present Administration and its successors. I certainly go nap on the endow-

ment principle, and that is the view of those who have spoken for the National Trust.<br><br>
I feel that the Minister has not met the case. I am not in general prepared blindly to follow Ulster, but in this case would it not be appropriate to bear in mind what they have done? Let us consider what, following our experience, Ulster has done in matters of finance. I speak here knowing what happened at the time because I was Chancellor of the Exchequer then. The late Major Sinclair, who perished in the most unhappy sinking of the "Princess Victoria," was very much attracted by the plan which we introduced and he said that they would introduce it on a smaller scale in Northern Ireland. They took the wise action which we have not yet taken of greatly widening the purposes for which this capital sum might be used.<br><br>
All we are asking this morning is that the Minister should not reject taking further additional power to be used in cases where he thinks fit. I feel that we have reached a point on this matter which is of very great importance. I hope the Minister will have second thoughts, otherwise I shall advise my hon. Friends to carry this to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. Fleetwood-Hesketh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening at this late stage, but I have listened with the greatest care to what has been said. My object, like that of everyone else in the Committee, is to try to decide whether the Clause will result in more houses or fewer houses being saved. It appears to me that if the Clause were accepted it would help to save more houses.<br><br>
The Minister said that if the whole of the Land Fund were used in this way it would disappear. I do not think it would disappear. It would be used for the purpose for which it was originally intended and, moreover, would attract a great deal of private money as well, so that we should get Â£2 for every Â£1 spent. This is, of course, a permissive power; the Minister is under no obligation to use it.<br><br>
The comments on depreciation of money could apply to anything in any circumstances, but in passing I might say that one of the most suitable forms of investment for endowment money is land which surrounds a house. Land is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0311">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
admittedly one of the things which continues to rise in value; with the depreciation of money, it holds its own.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Vane) spoke of the importance of keeping the National Trust independent, and I heartily agree with him, but I suggest that we are more likely to keep it independent by making endowments than by placing it in the position of receiving annual grants which may at some time be withdrawn. For these reasons, I hope very much that my right hon. Friend will give the matter further earnest consideration. We wish to cooperate in every way possible, but I must confess that I do not feel altogether convinced.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggested that he thought it would be dishonest for him to ask for these powers because, for reasons which he gave, he would not think it right to use them. He said that, for that reason, he did not think it right to take these powers. That form of words is often used, and it is very objectionable. Ministers do not take powers; Parliament confers powers on Ministers if it thinks a Department ought to have powers. It is not for Ministers ever to talk about taking powers. That is a completely false understanding of the relationship between Parliament and the Executive. It is for Parliament to confer power if Parliament thinks it right to do so.<br><br>
As has been pointed out, these powers are permissive. I can understand the present Minister thinking, for the reasons which he gave, that, although Parliament might confer these powers upon him, he would not be disposed to use them, but other Ministers might wish to use them. That completely dispels any suggestion that there could be any dishonesty on the part of the present Government in accepting the powers which very many hon. Members of the Committee wish the Department to have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope my right hon. Friend will carefully consider what has been said on both sides of the Committee this morning and not commit himself one way or the other at this stage of the Bill. There seems to me to be a very great advantage in having some such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
scheme as this. I put my name to the Clause to attempt to work out some form of capital grant so that as many houses as possible of outstanding historic or architectural importance could be preserved. If we can extract income from the Land Fund in the form of capital grant in addition to the very minute sums in the Bill, I believe the object that we all have in mind could be achieved. I do not say that it would be achieved 100 per cent., but it would be to a far larger extent than we can hope from the provisions of the Bill or in view of the need for public economy in the years lying immediately ahead. I hope my right hon. Friend will not commit himself about this or about the argument against immortality.<br><br>
After all, we have only to look out of the window to see Lambeth Palace. It is not immortal, but it has been there for a very long time and we hope it will be there for another 500 years. Provided that it is looked after by those who are responsible for it, there is no reason to suppose that Lambeth Palace will not be there in 500 years' time. Of course, one can never foresee the future. There might be an atom bomb, as the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) said. There might even be the awful possibility of the right hon. Gentleman himself being Chancellor of the Exchequer again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There would be no Land Fund but for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We ought to try our hardest towards immortality in the realm of historic houses.<br><br>
There is another argument on the subject of immortality. It has been said that the land maintains its value even when other investments depreciate. That is one point of view, but this money is tax free, and I should have thought that, with the independence of the National Trusts in investing capital, and the fact that it is tax free, it should not be beyond the powers of those advising the National Trusts to maintain the value of their investments even when there is a steady depreciation in the value of money.<br><br>
It has been the experience of those who have been fortunate enough over a period of years to avoid death duties
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0312">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
that, even when there has been depreciation in the value of money, the capital value of their investments, if prudently looked after, has in one lifetime been materially increased. There are bad times; there are good. If one takes it over an extensive period of years, it should be possible to maintain, if not increase, the capital value of investments. I appeal to my right hon. Friend not to deride the attempt at immortality but to try to help.<br><br>
I also wish very strongly to support the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Vane) about the importance of economy in the administration of the money and the fact that the National Trusts can maintain these properties much more economically than any Government Department can. If we can give these bodies a capital sum which will be in the nature of a fixed endowment there will be an incentive to economy even if the value of money happens to depreciate.<br><br>
On the other hand, if it is handed over to a Government Department under Part I of the Bill, there will not be the same incentive to economise because we shall simply get what is happening in so many Government departments today, a demand for an increased sum in the next Finance Bill to cover the increased costs of living, wages and salaries and so on.<br><br>
For this and other reasons, I believe that my right hon. Friend would be well advised to think further on this matter, not to commit himself today, and, if he possibly can, bring forward on the Report stage something more in accordance with what I believe are the wishes of the majority of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Minister realises that the whole Committee feels that he should give way on this matter. One does not have to be a clairvoyant to imagine that he probably thinks we are right, in spite of his speech. I will offer him an argument to show that the request is modest, apart from being permissive. The Universities Grants Committee receives its finances and has a complete and absolute right to decide how to spend them, and there is no Treasury control over them. The Arts Council receives its money in a quinquennial grant. There is no interference
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
with the way it is spent; the Arts Council is trusted to spend it. Yet, here, in each and every case on a permissive provision the Minister will be able to say yea or nay. It is a very modest provision and our request is something to which the Minister might accede. After all, the Trusts are dependent upon endowments which are now not as valuable as they were pre-war. The value of their expenditure is now less than half what it was pre-war.<br><br>
If we are proud of the work of the Trusts, we ought to support them, and if we find that their endowments are such that they cannot do their work properly, surely it is not asking too much to support a Clause of this kind. I hope the Minister will find it possible to say that he thinks the principle behind the Clause is a correct one and that he will accede to our request.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godfrey Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for intervening in the discussion as I have not been able to listen to all of it. Perhaps, for that reason, it is easier for one to make a valuable contribution. I am very much impressed by the argument that if there is an economy campaign, as there is bound to be whatever party is in power, ancient and historic buildings would be the first to fall. If one were Chancellor of the Exchequer, that would be one's natural and right reaction, that buildings which have existed for a long time could go on existing a little longer without Treasury support. I hope my right hon. Friend realises that he is placing his hon. Friends in a difficult position unless he gives his word that he will reconsider the matter before the Report stage or the next sitting of the Committee. I most earnestly beg him to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At an earlier stage of the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary suggested that one difficulty about accepting the suggestion of endowments might be the attitude of the Public Accounts Committee. I do not pretend to speak for that Committee; I only know that it has considered the point and has in the past agreed to the principle of endowments as illustrated in such bequests as the Penrhyn case and others, although it has been anxious that not too large a sum should be provided by way of endowment for the proper maintenance of the estate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0313">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
However, the Committee has completely accepted the point of view and it is merely its concern to ensure that the wish of Parliament shall be properly carried out. If we insert this provision and give this power to the Minister, I am sure that the Public Accounts Committee would be only too anxious merely to see that it was properly administered, which is its duty. I do not feel that the point which was raised on Second Reading need disturb us in considering the value of this proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Hollis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join other hon. Members in hoping very much that my right hon. Friend will consider the matter again. There has been such a strong volume of opinion in the Committee that I imagine that that will happen and so we shall not this morning get the final form that the Clause will take.<br><br>
If that be so, and the form of the Clause is to be given further consideration, there is a point which I should like to raise, if I am not straying too far out of order. If the precise wording of the Clause is to be reconsidered, I should like to be a little clearer about the consequence of the last sentence where we are talking about the necessity to provide an income:
<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ for the upkeep of any land held with and forming part of the amenities thereof, or for the repair or maintenance of any objects ordinarily kept in such building."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that an object of beauty is only covered if it happens to be in the building, but there might well be some object of beauty in the land which was not actually in the building. It is a small point, and I wonder if it could be borne in mind if the Clause is redrafted.<br><br>
I think we are agreed on the general principle that we are not particularly concerned with meditation on immortality. As to what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) said about what would be the situation 500 years hence, it will not be finally decided by us this morning. We want to give to the people who are concerned not some feeling that the building will survive 500 years, which will not be in our power to settle, but some reasonable security for the next 10 or 15 years that things will go on all right.<br><br>
From that point of view I should have thought that it was a valid argument that, while there is a risk in all things, there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
is a smaller risk in endowments than in being dependent on a Government grant. I do not think it is unduly optimistic to believe that over the next 10 or 15 years this country will have been under the rule of an Administration which will prevent a disastrous collapse in the value of money. Therefore, I presume in view of the prognostications about the future which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland has, which are similar to his optimism at one time about the future financial situation in this country, that it would be reasonable to see whether we could not have a right of endowment.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. K. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think almost every argument that the right hon. Gentleman has adduced against the new Clause has been trenchantly answered on both sides of the Committee. I should like to deal very briefly with two things which he mentioned. He said that this would be a very good idea to get the Ministry of Works out of business. I think that is a most unworthy observation, and nothing was further from the mind of those who drafted this Clause or anyone in the National Trust to whom I have spoken. We have had extremely happy relations with his Department and we look forward to having equally happy relations in the future. I feel sure he did not mean that, and I hope he will tell the Committee that he did not mean it.<br><br>
He said that we cannot really do what the Trust want. What I tried to point out was that this was the only thing of any substance that the Trust asked for in connection with the Bill. One other thing he said was that the money in the National Land Fund would disappear at a rapid rate if he were to adopt this principle. But the money is not disappearing at all. It is accumulating, and, like Topsy, is growing and growing. With this Â£500,000 for five years it will continue to grow.<br><br>
It was my right hon. Friend's intention that the capital of the fund should be dispersed, not merely tinkered away at a rate of only one-seventh of the income annually. None of the right hon. Gentleman's arguments holds water. I am very glad that he did not put forward the argument about financial principles because that was dealt with very adequately by my right hon. Friend. Unless the right hon. Gentleman can have second thoughts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0314">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
and give us some very definite assurance, I shall ask my hon. Friends to divide on this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very interesting discussion. Right hon. and hon. Gentleman opposite apparently have no confidence in the State; indeed, they seem to be distressed about the State. Up to now we were always led to believe that they trusted the State, that it was all powerful, all wise, all knowing and all benevolent. Here we are faced with the extraordinary position that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have repudiated the State and prefer to give the authority to spend public money to a voluntary body, of which I happen to be a life member. If they are consistent in their views, they cannot possibly continue to support this new Clause, because it means that public money would be given in lumps to irresponsible people like me to buy certain houses which we did not fancy or which we did fancy.<br><br>
I am surprised at the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton). I hope the Minister will stand fast on the constitutional principle that the money shall be voted annually, and that as far as we can see to it, it will be spent in accordance with the wishes of the House. We do not want to give chunks of money to voluntary bodies which may be here today and away tomorrow. That is a preposterous proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Hinchingbrooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nobody has said much about the financial side of this matter, and although we are thinking in terms of historic monuments, we have present an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Works, whose knowledge of public finance is about equal to his knowledge of his Department. I do not think that we should be out of order in considering this specific aspect of the Clause and in asking several questions which my right hon. Friend might reply to at some stage, particularly about what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) referred to as the doctrinal objection to this method of financing the purchase of historic buildings.<br><br>
I have heard it mooted before that the Treasury have raised objections to this particular principle. I want to be careful in saying that I am not wedded to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
principle of the Clause, and indeed, I would rather say something in support of my right hon. Friend's attitude about it, but we have not been told if the Treasury has raised some sort of con stitutional or doctrinal objection to this. How can that be? The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland himself cited one or two items of transfer to the Treasury because of death duties, of houses, amenity lands, farmlands, agricultural land and so on, which in turn were handed to the National Trust. That obviously enshrines the principle that the State can make a public sum of money available by way of endowment to these two public bodies, or to some other ones like the National Trust.<br><br>
In another direction we have also had an example of public money being handed over. One hon. Gentleman opposite spoke about the Arts Council. Money is handed to the Arts Council, and they can use it any way they wish, provided it fulfils the term of their needs, but what is this question that the Treasury has raised on this whole matter? Perhaps my right hon. Friend will tell us something about it when he comes to reply.<br><br>
It is said that we cannot make a capital sum available to a private or semi-public institution because Parliament loses control of the money, but I do not see that at all, because what Parliament is doing is to look at a certain sum which the Ministry of Works would provide from the National Land Fund, which is dealt with by Parliament through the public accounts committee. The money is handed over to a particular institution for a specific purpose, and that is not the kind of problem we need not be bothered about. Could we hear about the constitutional aspect of this matter?<br><br>
The second point I wanted to consider arises in my answer to an argument put forward by the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson). He talked about the growing fund. Of course, the National Land Fund has been growing. If it had been invested by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland in securities which yielded a proper return it would be more valuable than it is today. To some extent the right hon. Gentleman is at fault.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. K. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This fund was invested in liquid or semi-liquid securities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I0315">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 595</span>
because it was my right hon. Friend's intention that the capital should be used. All we are saying is that the rate of interest is extremely low for a fund of which the capital has never been used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. Eccles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are very lucky it was not invested in "Daltons."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Hinchingbrooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had this money been invested in land or in stocks and shares or some other Government stocks which yield a higher rate, we would have more money now to play about with, and the right hon. Gentleman's case would be all the better. The hon. Member for St. Pancras, North did not controvert my right hon. Friend. In fact, no one has attempted to do so, but he proved conclusively to me that the capital sum available is quite insufficient, even in the National Land Fund, to provide the sort of endowment which would be required if the new Clause were accepted and this new method were established. The revenue from the National Land Fund would be only one-fifth of the total amount which Parliament in the end might decide it was appropriate to spend. But nobody in this Committee so far has taken up the point which my right hon. Friend made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important matter, but surely there are two points about it. First of all, is it intended that of the grant method the capital of the National Land Fund should be used for the making of grants? It not, I cannot see that the grant method will save any more money than the endowment system. Secondly, has the hon. Gentleman borne in mind that if it is left to the Trust they will do things far more cheaply than the Ministry and the endowment required will be much smaller, as more will be provided by the owner?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Hinchingbrooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a long Parliamentary tradition blur- ring the difference between capital and interest, particularly in death duties, and it is quite likely that what was originally established as a capital fund will be used for current purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the fund will disappear very quickly and that will get rid of it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 596</span>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Hinchingbrooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That depends on how far it is spent, and on the willingness of Parliament to reconstitute it when it is spent. When the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland in 1946 switched Â£50 million across to the National Land Fund, Parliament said nothing about it. In fact, they were rather pleased and they hoped the money was going to be spent. For various reasons of which the Committee is fully aware, it was never spent. I think there is a great deal of substance in the case my right hon. Friend has made today. He brought forward a very distinct proposition which obviously his Ministry has considered in the greatest possible detail, and in the course of our debates his proposals have been dealt with very skilfully by the hon. Member for St. Pancras on behalf of the National Trust. The National Trust have brought a view into this Committee this morning which is in sharp conflict with the views of my right hon. Friend and his Department.<br><br>
I do not think that this last hour has been wasted in this Committee for our debate was most interesting on a topic which we are all keen to see fully dealt with. We have to consider the two views that have been put forward, and I hope very much when we meet on Thursday morning that we may draw to a swift conclusion on this matter, because I have a feeling that my right hon. Friend would like to settle this matter on the Committee stage. Of course, it is possible for him to rise now and say that he would like to defer taking a decision until we next meet or that he will accept the Amendment.<br><br>
On the whole, we have had a discussion this morning which will do a good deal of useful service to the cause which the Committee has at heart, and I am quite certain that when we meet again hon. Members will have had time to debate the conflicting views in their own minds and with each other so that we shall bring the matter to a very successful conclusion.</span></p>
