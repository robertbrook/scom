	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that it would convenient at the same time to consider the next three Amendments, in line 18, to leave out "or authorities and either"; in line 18, to leave out "all houses or to"; and in line 19, after the second "or," to insert "contiguous or adjacent."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be convenient; they deal with the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Clause is drafted, it is very general and gives the Minister power-to make a wide arrangement under which the local authorities may act. The purpose of the Amendment is to make his action particular and to require him to give his sanction in separate cases rather than on the general issue. We do not like this Clause and this arrangement that local authorities may dispose of houses which have been built in groups in order to create a pool of houses for letting. We feel that to allow a general disposal, without any Ministerial control whatever, would be a very dangerous practice. Therefore, we desire that the Minister should give special authority to each scheme which is put up to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Housing and Local Government (Mr. Harold Macmillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This series of Amendments would have the effect of preventing the Minister from laying down in a general set of conditions, as we propose, the fundamental conditions which must be borne in mind by a local authority. They would make it necessary for every single case and every single proposal to be submitted to him. I should have thought that that was going too far in the control of a local authority. It is true that there is some minor adjustment in a later
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
Amendment, affecting "contiguous or adjacent" houses, but, broadly speaking, the Amendments mean that every single house, or one or two grouped together, would have to be submitted for the special approval of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to be putting upon the local authority a duty which is more than is reasonable and to be putting upon the Minister and his officials a duty which is more than they can properly carry out. Some of these local authorities are very large, and all are important; but surely they are much more likely to be capable of judging for themselves and drawing up their own schemes than is the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Amendment a house which is to be sold would have to be covered by all the rules and regulations which I have laid down, and then the local authority would have to take the matter up with the regional officer, the whole great machine of Whitehall would have to begin to move until, finally, the issue would have to be sent to the Minister for decision. He is supposed to say, "You cannot sell No. 2, Acacia Avenue. It must be No. 3, Acacia Avenue, where John lives—the boy who plays the cornet in the silver band." I cannot take upon myself so intimate a knowledge of all that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole pressure of recent years has been against this tendency to centralise all authority, either regionally or at Whitehall, and there has been a genuine demand that, subject to general principles and broad instructions given from time to time by the Minister, local authorities should be given the opportunity to conduct their affairs in detail on their own authority. Just as it would be wrong for me to give a general approval without all this elaborate system of general rules, so it is proper for me to preserve the right to rebuke an authority or to look into any case brought to my notice which has been badly carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, to ask that every single case of a sale should be specifically approved by the Minister would be to make the thing unworkable and would rightly be regarded as a sign by my Ministry that we did not have real confidence in the operation of local authorities in their own sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, content with the general lines which we discussed the other day,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>329</span>
the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) will not press this Amendment, which would make it impossible to operate the Clause except by specific Whitehall agreement to every scheme submitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James MacColl</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two stages in this argument. First, there is the question of whether or not we should limit the approval to separate local authorities, and secondly there is the question of whether we should limit the approval to houses or groups of houses. The Committee should bear in mind what the Minister is seeking to do in the Bill. Under existing legislation, not only are the local authority bound by the condition of a fair price, but they are also bound to go to the Minister for individual assent, so that in the principal Act, which, after all, is not a piece of Socialist centralisation but is, in fact, the 1936 Act, there are those two checks on the housing policy of the local authority—first, the check on the price, and secondly, the check that in each case the authority must go to the Minister to obtain his sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that the reason why he has brought in new legislation is primarily to deal with the financial problem. He says he has been legally advised that in the present situation, if he tried to work the 1936 Act, he would be forced to tell local authorities that they must sell their houses at what he regarded as a profiteering price. Be that as it may—we discussed it at some length earlier in the proceedings, and it is not relevant to this argument—if it is the reason why he is seeking to amend existing legislation, why is he carrying it so far as to surrender the other check, which is that in each case the policy of the authority should be subject to the scrutiny of the Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an experiment in the sense that for the first time we are allowing local authorities to sell public assets at less than the best price. We are giving a very great discretion, and I should be inclined to add that we are giving a very great temptation to authorities to alienate these assets which were acquired out of public funds and to do so at prices below the best price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to be satisfied that that will not lead to abuse, surely it is most important that the Minister should keep a very careful eye on what is happening. Further, he should be answerable to Par-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
liament for what is happening, so that in any case where an authority appear to be neglecting their duty to the people who want houses to rent and appear to be selling houses in large numbers at prices barely above the minimum laid down in the conditions, the Minister will be open to Question in the House about what is happening in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Clause is passed unamended, will it be possible to question the Minister on the policy of a certain authority or will he be able to reply, "I am giving a general permission to all authorities subject to these conditions"—and the conditions themselves, which he is laying down, will not be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny or examination but will be laid down in a circular. If his reply should be, "I am prepared to give a general permission to all authorities within those terms to sell houses, regardless of local conditions, regardless of the customs of the area and of its present problems," will that leave us in a position to ask the Minister why a certain housing authority are selling a large part of their total stock of houses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely one of the most obvious considerations about housing problems is the wide variation from place to place and from type of area to type of area. What may be a reasonable policy for adoption in a suburb or a seaside resort may be quite fantastic in a heavily industrial area—and yet the Minister's permission would cover all areas. The Minister does not intend to look at the housing problem of an area and to say, "In the circumstances of that area, I can see that there is a case for selling the houses." He has surrendered that important control and is inviting us—and from what he has said it is clear that he intends to take advantage of the authority that we give—to permit him to give a general permission covering all these areas, regardless of the size of the housing lists and of the general level of earnings in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important Amendment. The Minister was wrong to approach it in such a cavalier way. He said that it was a question of giving a certain amount of discretion to local authorities and asked? "Why should we bother to harness them by careful supervision?" The answer is that he is asking the Committee for wide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
departures from what are the normal controls over a local authority which, if preserved, make it less important that there should be the specific personal control of the Minister. The normal economic controls are to be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is to be done, surely the least we can ask is that the Minister should keep a careful eye on every case in this policy of the sale of council houses, so that he can inform the House about what is being done in any area, and accept responsibility for it. This is an experiment. We have no means of knowing how it will work. It may be that some of the grim forebodings of some hon. Members on this side of the Committee are exaggerated, and it may be that the scheme will work more smoothly than we think; but in the early stages, when we are seeing how it works, surely it is reasonable to ask the Minister to limit his approval to each individual case so that he can look at the nature of the bargain which is being struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He can then consider whether it is a fair and just bargain or whether there is anything under-the-counter about it. He can go into the question of whether there is a genuine need or whether someone is being allowed to jump the queue. All these points, which go to the very core of this policy, will be open to examination and test in the House through Questions to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reasonable compromise is that proposed in the last of the group of Amendments which deals with a group of houses which are sited together and are similar in character. Under the Amendment, if the Minister is satisfied that there is a case for selling that number of houses, he can give a general authority and need not give authority for each house. Nevertheless, the general principle remains, which the Minister has made no attempt to meet—that it would be wrong to give this licence to local authorities to depart in general from what have been the accepted principles of housing policy without any regard to the circumstances of each area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is not asking too much of the Minister for him to say that before he permits an authority to embark on this policy he must satisfy himself personally that there is a case for it and that there will not be any abuse—and, indeed, that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
there is no risk of the powers being used for wrong and improper purposes. I should have thought that that was an elementary safeguard which anybody who cared for the smooth and proper administration of local government would want to see in the Bill, and I am surprised that the Minister has treated the Amendment so unsympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. R. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that there is a question of principle here, but I do not in the least agree with his statement of what the principle is. We are engaged in amending Section 79 of the 1936 Act, and if one looks at that Section one finds a number of subsections, one of which speaks of any land acquired or appropriated by a local authority. It is consistently referred to as "the land."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Act clearly had in mind was a piece of land in the nature of a housing estate or something of that sort. The difficulty about obtaining the consent of Whitehall does not seem to have occurred to the Conservative framers of that Act. For instance, immediately before paragraph (	<i>c</i>), which is what we are dealing with now, the consent of the Minister is required to any sale of the land or part of the land, or exchange of the land or part of the land, for other land thought to be better adapted for housing. That still remains the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The innovation which the Minister is introducing is to allow a general consent to be given. He has told us that the Amendment would prevent him from issuing circulars, but it would do nothing of the sort. It would be perfectly open to the right hon. Gentleman to issue a circular indicating the principles governing the consent which he would have to give. With great respect, I think he went on to give his own case away entirely, because he said, "Of course, I shall have to attend to any individual cases which are brought to my notice."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what means the Minister intends to employ to have these cases brought to his notice. Are individual ratepayers, who get a bit cross about seeing a housing estate sold off by a reactionary council, to write to the Minister? Does he intend to employ an additional staff to go round to see what all councils are doing? What steps does the Minister intend to take to deal with these individual cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
If a general, sweeping consent is to be given to councils to sell houses as and when they like, and that is to be the only consent required, then the Minister is doing, in the opposite sense, exactly what he objected to one of his predecessors doing—laying down a general principle and going no further. In that case, of course, it was a negative principle, but in this case apparently the Minister contemplates giving a completely general permission and leaving it at that, unless, to quote his words—and I hope I quote him correctly—"Some particular case is brought to my attention." How it is to be brought to his attention he completely fails to tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Amendment propose an unreasonable and undue interference with the discretion of the local authority? Apart from the fact that the 1936 Act especially required the Minister's consent in other cases and, as far as one can see, required his consent under the subsection which we are now altering; apart from that, let us see what the Minister can do if he accepts this group of Amendments. He can, of course, issue a circular about the general principles upon which he is prepared to give consent—the type of circular which is frequently issued by the Ministry of Education in dealing with local educational authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, the Minister's consent has to be obtained if an isolated house is sold. I must say that I regard that as right and proper, because under the Bill a local authority are entitled to sell No. 1 Acacia Avenue, No. 14 Acacia Avenue, No. 17 Acacia Avenue and No. 23 Acacia Avenue. I cannot claim such experience of local government as many hon. Members of the Committee have had, especially hon. Members on this side of the Committee, but I should have thought that such a sale would knock all arrangements for repair and maintenance completely cock-eyed, and that the sale of individual houses in such a way ought not to be permitted except in quite exceptional circumstances, or where there is some peculiar type of housing estate which makes it a reasonable thing to do. If such individual sales were to be the policy of a local authority, it would surely be proper for the Minister, through his officials, to examine the case and, it may be, to withhold his consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one sort of policy which I feel certain the Minister does not want local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
authorities to adopt. It would be a foolish and most wasteful procedure. But supposing the local authority do what is far more likely—start selling blocks of houses. Apart from any general objection—and we are not dealing with that at the moment—the right hon. Gentleman will have noticed that there is an Amendment which would allow him to give his consent to the sale of a block of houses, for a block obviously consists of contiguous houses in the case of a terraced block or, in the more usual case, of adjacent houses. Indeed, I am not sure that the Amendment goes far enough, because it lays down no limit whatever to the size of the block which could be sold in this way, so that a mass of adjacent houses, covering the whole of the housing estate for that matter, could be sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister is not unduly interfering with the discretion of local authorities if he carries out that far the original intention of the 1936 Act. If I thought that these Amendments were unworkable or were an interference with the proper discretion of local authorities, I should not support them for a moment, but it seems to me that the Minister is going far too far the other way and, under the guise of a general permission, is inviting what may be complete chaos in municipal housing—a chaos which will depend on the local authorities, with which he cannot interfere and will not interfere, and which will be put right only if the Minister happens to notice it in some particular area at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely that is wrong. The right hon. Gentleman has been re-christened "Minister of Housing" What does he intend to do about this problem? Does he intend to allow these numerous local authorities such a completely free hand that they can cut up housing estates into bits and pieces and sell off the houses, one here and one there? There will be nothing to prevent them unless the matter is brought to the Minister's attention, how or by whom being completely obscure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could have understood if the Minister on a previous occasion had been more enthusiastic about accepting the services of the district valuer. But I cannot understand his point of view this morning. It seemed to me a trifle facetious. He referred to John the cornet player, who may be a character
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
in fiction of whom he learned in his boyhood. We on this side of the Committee do not know him. The Minister suggested that he might be expected to take up the question of every individual property, but that is not the point at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On an earlier occasion we tried to guard against this sort of thing. We suggested that an independent authority, such as the district valuer, should be called in. The Minister refused to accept that, and said that this was one of the matters we might well leave to the local authorities themselves. The Minister ought to say whether, in spite of that, the services of the district valuer will be available to those local authorities who require them. After all, local authorities are used to that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though the Amendments may bear the interpretation that they apply to each and every house that is not the point. The Minister has also turned down the idea that these houses should be sold only to sitting tenants. Who will buy them? Whole estates could be sold by a contract between a local authority and some finance corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not? Where is the safeguard? It could be a straightforward deal. This sort of question has bedevilled local authorities for years. The sole reason why the 1948 Act was envisaged on the basis that valuation could go over to the Board of Inland Revenue was merely because fundamentally no central Government was prepared to trust local authorities where their own advantage was concerned. There is no reason why they should. We know full well that that service went over to the Board of Inland Revenue because local authorities had made no honest attempt to act with uniformity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself says that he is not prepared to submit this matter to the district valuer. He is not prepared to say that only tenants shall have the right to buy these houses. I do not want to enter into a long dissertation about who might be the purchasers of the houses. A speech on that subject could be just as long as the one which was addressed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
to the Committee about the price at which houses should be sold; but we are approaching the holiday time and getting "near to the end of this Bill, and I want to keep to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might have explained how it will be impossible, if this Bill is left as it is, for local authorities to sell out to private finance corporations. We have no answer to that at all. It seems to us that the Minister has turned down all the Amendments which might have safeguarded that position. We consider that the point needs far more clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. W. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed the Minister shake his head when my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Pannell), suggested that under this Clause whole estates could be sold. Surely it is clear that if the Minister gives a general authority for the sale of all or any houses—and he has power to do that under this Clause—it means that those reactionary local housing authorities who never have liked public housing very much, can sell whole estates, or large slices of estates. It is common knowledge that there are large property owning companies, some of them with very dubious antecedents, who would jump at the opportunity of buying large blocks of municipal houses, possibly whole estates, in order to exploit them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister has not accepted these Amendments. The whole basis of the arguments advanced by hon. Gentlemen opposite has been that they wish to extend what they call the property owning democracy, the ownership of individual houses by the tenants. But so far as it may be possible under this Bill for property owning companies or insurance companies to buy large blocks of houses—and individual tenants will not buy blocks of houses—all this nonsense we have heard so often about individual ownership and a property owning democracy goes by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought the Minister would have accepted these Amendments, or something like them, to make sure that if a local authority wishes to sell, at any rate it should be a sale of individual houses to individuals, and that must mean to the tenants occupying them. My information is, however, that very few authorities will wish to sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
I hope the Minister will say something about the possibility of large blocks of council estates being sold. I recall a case which occurred some years ago where a large slice of housing land was sold to a private developer. It was land which had been bought for municipal housing, but the policy was changed and the whole of the land was sold to a private developer. The wording of this Clause seems to make it possible for that vicious principle to be extended to houses when they are built. We ought to have some guarantee from the Minister about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Keenan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know what safeguard there is on the question of groups of houses, or terraced houses, on an estate, being transferred from a local authority to private ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Clapham (Mr. Gibson) reminded me of something which occurred in the early Thirties in my own town. The local authority actually took what was a tip from Lord Derby, who was formerly the owner of the whole of the town. We paid 1s. 2d. per yard for the tip. We spent 1s. 3d. to level it for the purpose of re-housing the people of Bootle. Except for about three acres, that land was given to private builders. Instead of the council building on it, all that happened was that a ground rent was charged because the corporation had actually paid 2s. 5d. for buying and for levelling the land. But instead of it being used for housing the people of that town, it was handed over to private builders who built on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about how far that kind of thing might be repeated by the transferring of houses in the same authority. At a previous Sitting of the Committee I wanted to insist on the scarcity value being charged for houses, because I considered that to be a safeguard against houses being sold under those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind what occurred at the end of the last war when two houses were built in 1928-9 for £500. The purchaser was unable to complete his purchase, and the houses came back to the local authority. Houses of that type could then be sold at £1,100 to £1,200, yet the local authority disposed of them for £950. One went to a relative of the people living on one side, and the other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
to a relative of the people living on the other side. It was a mutual arrangement by which both parties got a bargain at the expense of the local authority. For reasons such as that we ought to be more concerned about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has ridiculed the idea of authority being given to him. He said he could not accept personal responsibility. I agree. Nobody would ever expect a Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary to be able to accept such a responsibility. But the fact remains that the responsibility rests with his Ministry to prevent local authorities from abusing the powers which may loosely be given to them; and while that responsibility rests with the Ministry, the House of Commons can obtain the facts by questioning the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody expects the Minister to accept a personal responsibility. One might as well expect the Minister of Fuel and Power to be concerned about which ton of coal came out of which coal mine—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter for the Coal Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keenan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We know that the Minister cannot accept such a personal responsibility, and he should not ride off on that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph T. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At a previous sitting of the Committee the Minister made a rather significant admission, that inquiries by his Department had revealed that many local authorities, especially county authorities, had abused the powers under which they administered the subsidies on agricultural holdings. I do not know how far such an abuse extends, and I do not know whether the Minister would like to qualify his statement in the light of subsequent discussion. But it is a matter of surprise to me that after having attempted to say that there had been abuse even in the case of a minor power of that kind, he is now proposing to extend the discretion of local authorities over much wider powers.

I do not know on what grounds he bases his confidence. It is true that local government in this country is accepted as one of the most desirable features of our democratic machinery, and one which should be preserved and developed. It is true that many excellent men have been engaged in local government for many

years. But we should bear in mind that where powers of this magnitude are to be surrendered to the absolute discretion of local authorities, we cannot escape the conclusion that there are many vested interests which have fouled property landlordship in the past, and which are likely to creep into transactions of this kind in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in an area where a rising rate is a matter of public agitation, who will say that the matter will not be an acute political issue? We may get the Conservative Party saying that we should bring down the rates by selling council houses, and we may have a local authority not unconnected with property interests in which that might be an attractive proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without any disrespect to hon. and learned Members, the very question of the conveyancing of large numbers of houses might be an attractive proposition to those actually taking part in the decisions on such matters. We might find on local authorities representatives of building societies, insurance companies, housing factors and others with fingers in the pie of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Local councillors are nearly always excluded from a case in which they have a personal interest, but the position of many local authorities is such that one could not entirely disconnect a business transaction of this kind from the council members, and thus this is a dangerous provision.

The exploitation of ground rents has been one of the most anti-social factors in housing in the North of England. My house—I speak as the owner of it—is built on a field which was sold for £30 an acre. Eight houses were built to the acre and the ground rent was £6 for each house, making £48 for each £30 involved in the original sale of the land. In the case of houses built by public money which are public property I wonder whether the Minister will provide some safeguard in regard to ground rents. The ground rent system as I have experienced it in the North of England has been a blot on our social arrangements, and I hope we shall unleash no further developments of that kind upon the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Ewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this morning I shall be luckier than I was at the last Sitting when I did not get an answer to a question which I put to the Minister. I shall repeat the question later, and I hope that the Minister may be able to answer it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we take it that the Minister is reversing the position under the previous Act whereby local authorities, after having decided on a certain policy about selling council houses, went to the Minister and asked permission? Will the Minister, in view of his powers under this Bill, now tell the local authorities that he is lifting the ban imposed by his predecessor and that he will, by circular, give local authorities 	<i>carte blanche</i> permission to sell houses in future? Or will the Minister make a speech at a Conservative garden party and say that in the interests of a property owning democracy local authorities may in future sell their houses to people who want to acquire them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question between one resident of Acacia Road and another. It is not a matter of whether John plays a silver cornet in a brass band that will decide the issue. What will decide it in future is the policy which has been exercised by Labour-controlled local authorities who have had certain priorities on the housing list and people in those priorities have had preference when council houses have become available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the sitting tenant be protected or will a local authority under this general and uncontrolled direction be able to sell a house over his head even if he does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
not want to move although he may be offered alternative accommodation? The Minister must not say that that cannot happen, for it can happen under the powers which he is taking, and it can happen under the powers which local authorities have at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was the chairman of a housing committee some years ago the surveyors went, with the permission of the local authority officers, to survey a house which they wanted to buy for a prospective owner. The sitting tenant said that he did not want to move because he had built a shed, provided extra fencing and put extra work into the garden. I had to go to my committee and get the council to decide that in future council houses should not be sold. I hope the Minister will provide safeguards in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the question to which I should like an answer. At our last Sitting the Minister said that vacant council houses or newly-built houses can be sold to suitable persons on the housing list. Within the Minister's definition of suitable persons on the housing list, does that mean that people on the housing list who can afford to buy their own house shall have preference for a newly-built council house or one which falls vacant to the detriment of others on the list who can only afford to rent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister replies that a suitable tenant means one who can afford to buy his bouse and that he shall have preference, the whole order of priorities based on need is thrown overboard. Under the powers which the Minister is now taking, I see nothing to stop a local authority suspending the ordinary priorities on its housing list and deciding to build 20 or 30 houses in selected blocks on an estate or a small estate of houses for occupation by persons on the waiting list who can afford to buy their house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The iniquity of this system is that if a person wanting to buy a house puts his name on the waiting list his need does not have to be taken into account. The system will be open to exploitation. People with money will be able to place their names on the housing list and will be permitted to jump the queue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Socialist-controlled housing authorities will not ask the Minister for permission and they will completely ignore the direc-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
tions in his circulars and his speeches. Many local authorities, like my own local authority, have refused to sell council houses until the back of the housing problem is broken. I have no fear about this so far as Socialist-controlled housing authorities are concerned. My only fear is that certain non-Socialist-controlled authorities want these powers and will exercise them to the detriment of people with greater need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Ewart) complained that I had shown a lack of courtesy in not answering his question precisely at our last Sitting. I was not conscious of not having done so. He will agree that when answering a long debate it is not always easy to reply to every detail. However, in spite of the suspicion and malice which seems to activate him in everything regarding the Bill, I will do my best to answer him precisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the right to sell council houses will be permissive, and not mandatory, on the local authorities. The hon. Member knew that. He only asked the question to obscure the issue and create prejudice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said there were certain local authorities who would not exercise the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point at all so far as the Minister is concerned. If the hon. Member had listened to the Second Reading debate and our other debates he would know as well as I do that there is no intention on the part of the Minister—and, indeed, he has no power—to say to any local authority that they must put up a scheme</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that there was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked whether it was permissive or mandatory on the local authorities. It is permissive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Member's second question, the answer to which equally answers the whole debate, I must excuse myself if I did not make it sufficiently clear before. Under Section 32 of the earlier Act the consent of the Minister may be given generally either to all local authorities or to any local authority or authorities in relation either

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
to all houses or to any house. In other words, the Minister may give a general permission or give a special permission in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we propose in this case—it is really the best working arrangement—is not to go to the extreme by saying that every single case which might arise, no matter how great, important or practised the authorities may be, has to be agreed. We shall not say in relation to one house, or in the case of one or two houses, that it has to be agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or a housing estate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come later to the housing estate. We propose to send out the circular to which reference has been made and to say that, if the local authorities keep the rules laid down in it, that will be taken as the equivalent of a general permission, but if they want to do anything outside the rules, that will be a special case. In other words, instead of asking on each occasion all the questions set down in the circular, we shall say that, as long as the local authorities conform to everything, we shall not bother them in every case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be on a most important point. It seems that the test will be whether or not the proposal put up by the local authorities conforms to the conditions laid down. Those conditions are not known to the Committee and thus we are in the dark on a vitally important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to explain the intentions as fully as possible. I said that the final form will still be subject, as is the common practice in the Department, to discussion with the representatives of the local authority, but, broadly speaking, all the conditions will be covered. I have already given a number of examples. If necessary I will go further, because I do not want any misunderstanding. The only alternative would be to put every single condition in the Bill, and those of us with experience in these matters know what a problem that is apt to be. If there is a little latitude we can get better arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. A. Pargiter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did not the Conservative Party, while in opposition, strongly object to legislation by delega-

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but there is a difference between legislation by delegation generally and legislation by delegation to popularly elected bodies which are elected at frequent intervals and subject to the whole pressure of democratic life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the selling of an estate to a syndicate of speculators, that would be contrary to the regulations which I shall lay down, because I propose to say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not know them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that hon. Members do not know them, but I am trying to explain my difficulties, which I think hon. Gentlemen will accept. Either I have to put the whole contents of the circular into the Bill, or I do it in this way, which I think is a fairly well-known way. It is only to say that, if they do certain things, I will regard that as a general consent. If they do not, they will have to operate the individual consent which is provided for in the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am only interpreting the old Act by saying that, if the authorities conform to certain things, they need not ask for individual consent, and I already have the right to do that under the old Act. The hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) puts on an air of incredulity and even alarm, but that is the law under the Act. The consent of the Minister may be given generally either to all local authorities or to any local authority or authorities either in relation to all houses or in relation to any house or houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman one question? I have noticed a little confusion. What I think he is reading from is his own Bill, but, if what he is reading is in the old Act, which I have in front of me, I should be very glad if he could point out in which Section it is to be found.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is in the Bill, in Clause 3 (2). It is in the Bill before us. I think the principle is a simple one. I can either give a general consent, and I think that is the right way, subject to certain reasonable conditions, or, on the point of a housing estate being sold—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well be true, as the Minister has just mentioned, that there is a risk of some of the houses being sold to speculative groups. But I should have thought there was an even greater risk in the practical application of these powers, and that would be the pressure from very large industrial undertakings in localities to which labour had been sent, where there was pressure upon local authorities to sell blocks of houses because of the necessity of housing the people who had come to the district. This has already given rise to very great concern in many industrial areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I shall try to do. I shall say that if the local authority conforms to certain things, which I shall lay down after discussion with the authorities, that will be taken as a generalised consent, and I will not ask the authority for particulars of each case. One of these cases will be that of the sale to a sitting tenant. I agree that it is difficulty, but, if we are to operate it in this way, we must lay down these considerations, such as sale to a sitting tenant, or, in the case of new houses, to somebody taken from the housing list who might have been granted a private licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a case of the Tory Party or the Tory Administration which the hon. Member for Sunderland (Mr. Ewart), with all his indignation, is concerned about, which is operating the system of private licences from the housing list. What about the ratio of one in 10 or of one in five which was fixed by the greatest proletariat leader, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bbbw Vale (Mr. Bevan)? Were they taken from the housing lists? If it is wrong to allow a person to build or to buy a house, why is it so much more wrong under a Conservative Administration than under a Labour Administration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer to him would be that, if this was a case of a new house, which I do not think will occur very often, it would be most convenient on a new housing estate to get a particular type of occupier, which is very desirable, as the hon. Gentleman knows. It is one of our problems to get that variety of settlement and mixture of population, and it may even be very desirable on an estate to have a few houses sold to the people whom we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
specially want to have there and who are also in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of some of the most practised people who have studied the problem would confirm that that is the way it should be operated. They would be people taken from the housing list chosen by the local authority, and chosen on exactly the same principles as those which operated during the six years of Utopia when the Labour Government operated the one in four or the one in five ratio of houses for sale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ratio of one in 10 or one in five is no analogy at all. The one in five ratio concerned houses for which licences were granted for building for prospective owner-occupiers, and there is no analogy at all. Is the Minister now answering my question and saying that he would not countenance any local authority building a house specificially for a person who was No. 10 on the housing list while No. 1 on that list was in greater need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very practised in this sort of thing, and I can quite see how the people of Sunderland were deluded. He goes on asking me the same old question: "Have you stopped beating your mother, or kicking your wife." I do not propose to be caught by an old one like that. The hon. Gentleman knows the answer to every question before he asks it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), who treated me with the greatest courtesy and asked a sensible question, we shall try to lay down that, if they were doing anything that comes with the circular, I shall say that they do not need to ask me about this or that house in particular. We must have rules about the resale conditions, and about the people to whom the houses are to be sold. Some of these are included in the Bill, such as the right of pre-emption, while there are some other considerations which are not. So long as they do that, it will be a generalised permission. If they want to do anything outside that, they must ask for a particular permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman can rest absolutely assured—I want to be fair about this—that it would be impossible, under any general permission, that there could be the sale of the whole property to speculators or to anybody except the tenants or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
the people who were to live in the houses. If something of that kind were to take place, it would, of course, have to come up in the ordinary way for the individual permission of the Minister after the exercise of his discretion and the advice of those who advise him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the regulations can be so drawn that, provided the sale is an individual sale—that is, to individual people and one house at one time—there will be rules under which the local authority can act, or that if it is a case of the sale of more than one house to one person, that would be a special case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not contemplated that we shall deal with anyone except individuals. I think we are all agreed and are becoming property-owning democrats, and that we differ about the precise moment in time when it should be done. We differ as to whether the situation is right, but we all agree that we want to promote the ownership of houses by those who live in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the sale of council houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the natural objection was that, though this was a good thing to do, this may not be the right time to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole argument has been the exact opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the argument was that of the housing shortage, but I want to make clear that our object is that a man should own the house in which he lives and it will be laid down absolutely that, in general, property would not be sold on any other basis. I think that that is the right decision. Either we have to submit every single case for individual approval, which I think is unreasonable, or we have to lay down in the Bill—and I know that hon. Gentlemen trust me that we do intend to do this—a general set of regulations and say that, so long as the local authority has done certain things, I will give a general consent, but that, if they have not done those things, they will have to secure a particular consent. If the worst comes to the worst, or if I fail to draw up a circular or do not get it agreed, we should have to fall back upon individual consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer to a point which I raised one day last week. I appreciate that the Minister is in a difficulty in informing the Committee about the terms of the circular until he has reached the end of his discussions with the local authority associations, but will he make copies available to hon. Members immediately agreement has been reached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, and, I think, before the Report stage, though I would not commit myself to that, but as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Donnelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being here to hear the earlier part of the discussion. I appreciate the arguments which the Minister has advanced, but I wish to put it to him that they really are false arguments and that the basis of the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) is a valid one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take one illustration on the question of the new towns, under the New Towns Act, 1946, the new town Corporation is set up and builds the town, acting as agents of the Government. It can borrow money and have the support of the Ministry in all its actions. When the town is built and everything is settled, the aim is that the Corporation should fade away and that the local authority should take over its responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of the financing of the new towns—and this is relevant to the question whether council houses should be sold or not—is that the money recouped from rents comes back, the capital expenditure laid out by the public authority is used for the general economic benefit of the town, and the increase in land values created by the enterprise of the community is recouped by the whole of the community. The Minister will appreciate all that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman proposes to place on the Statute Book the possibility of general permission being given by any successor in his office when the Corporation fades away, and the local authority has to deal with the economic problems of the new town, then it comes to be a really practical problem. It is not one which is likely to arise in the next five or 10 years, but certainly in 20 years' time. I would like to know from the right hon. Gentleman whether he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
seriously believes that this general permission which he is proposing to place on the Statute Book, subject to certain administrative limitations which he will impose in the circular and which represent only the attitude of a certain Minister at a given time, is not likely seriously to undermine the whole of the financial aspect of the new towns in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, we were asked to vote £50 million for the new towns, and, not so long before, we were asked to vote another large sum. A large amount of public money has been committed to this great, and I think far-sighted and important, enterprise, but I do not want to discuss this matter at this stage of the Bill and find out later that we have prejudiced the whole basis of new towns finance, and that all our support for the hard work that has been done and the pious platitudes uttered by the Parliamentary Secretary have all been undermined because they have not taken this point into consideration. What I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman, therefore, is, what is the position about the new towns when the local authorities take over and when it is possible for them to sell their council houses to individuals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister if I led him astray in my short speech when introducing the Amendments. I did not intend to convey the impression that we were not serious about them. We on this side are not against the private ownership of houses. In fact, we are very much in favour of tenant-purchase schemes, which were possible under the 1923 and 1936 Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is anxious to let local authorites have wide, sweeping powers, and is prepared to trust them. His Tory predecessors in office, however, did not take that line. Under the tenant-purchase schemes of the 1936 Act, individual application had to be made to the Minister, by whom, in those days, very few schemes were approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the Ministers in those days disapprove of them? They would not agree to a local authority embarking upon a tenant-purchase scheme where it might be in competition with a speculative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
builder in the area. The whole attitude of the Ministry in those days was not a desire for confidence in the local authority and for the assurance that a person who bought a house from the local authority would have behind him all the resources of the local authority's technical staff—building inspectors, clerks of works, and the rest—as well as the local authority finance. They were anxious that the individual who desired to become a property owner should be forced into the hands of the speculative builder and the speculative financier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear that we on this side are in favour of tenant-purchase schemes. If the Minister will circularise local authorities encouraging them to go in for tenant-purchase schemes, we shall give him the fullest possible support. The schemes that we are discussing, and to which the Amendments refer, were conceived by the planning authority, the local architect and the local authority as schemes for houses for those who could only afford a house to rent. The general conception of lay-out, of rent collection and of maintenance of the properties, is dependent upon them becoming units within the local authority's control. Therefore, we feel that they ought to remain within the local authority's control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we, and myself especially, showed a lack of faith in local authorities. We have much greater faith in them as a result of the last loeal government elections than we had before. What we are worried about, and why we require the particular direction of the Minister rather than the general direction, is that those local authorities who are likely to use these powers in an extensive fashion are just those authorities who would be prepared to go in a direction in which we feel they ought not to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a very good discussion, but we feel seriously about these matters, and as a token we will divide against one of the Amendments, but not against all four.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pargiter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 23, at the end, to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that no such cousent shall be given to a sale or to a lease for more than seven years unless the purchaser or lessee covenants with the local authority that neither he nor any successor in title will mortgage or charge the house at any time within four years after the sale or lease otherwise than under the said paragraph (	<i>d</i>)."</p></blockquote>
The Amendment is designed to protect tenants from the badgering which may well arise in the event of the Bill becoming law. What, I think, would be the desire of everybody concerned is to prevent tenants from becoming subject to what we might term high pressure salesmanship on the part of insurance companies, building societies or any other bodies who are interested in investing money in properties through owner-occupier schemes. For that purpose we suggest that the raising of the money for this purpose should be done through the powers of Section 79 of the 1936 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this proposal were adopted it would mean that prospective purchasers, or, possibly, even all council house tenants, would not be subject to receiving all those very attractive brochures which might otherwise be sent to them. It is surprising how much people can be persuaded to act against their better judgment if a proposal is presented in a sufficiently attractive form. It might even be that the Bill would be presented in a sufficiently attractive form to make it appear to be desirable. It would be in the best interests of all concerned if there were limitations to prevent any type of speculative money-lending organisation—or, for that matter, any 	<i>bona fide</i> organisation, as distinct from the speculative kind—from muscling in on a scheme of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the literature which was sent out long before the war by insurance</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
	<p>companies, as well as by building societies, painted the attractions of house ownership in most glowing terms. In many cases that literature formed the basis of attraction for people to embark upon house purchase; but frequently those people, as a consequence of conditions of employment and other problems found themselves in great difficulty in maintaining their payments. Very many, unfortunately, lost their properties due to foreclosure.</p>
	<p>This is a very simple Amendment. If the Minister is unable to accept its precise wording but is prepared to accept the principle that it is undesirable that there should be any muscling in by outside people, and that the channels from which the money can be borrowed for the purpose should be limited in the manner suggested by the Amendment, that would be advantageous to the operation of the scheme. It would mean that people would not be subject to outside pressure but would come to a calm and considered judgment of their own volition, to the general advantage of the individual and to the ultimate success of the operation of the scheme.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (Mr. Ernest Marples)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Pargiter) moved the Amendment in reasonable terms, and his intention is clear. He wants to protect tenants from badgering, and he does not want high pressure salesmanship either by 	<i>bona fide</i> or speculative money lenders. He referred to their activities as "muscling in." That shows how the English language can be used for all sorts of purposes, because if a 	<i>bona fide</i> lender or a reputable building society or insurance company wanted to lend money in competition with a local authority, I should

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
not call it "muscling in" I should have thought that the purchaser of the house could best make his own choice and that he could take whichever terms suited him best. As long as both sides had a fair chance, fair competition and a fair start, I see no reason why we should make a monopoly of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendment is to prevent building societies, insurance companies or financial concerns of any sort from lending money to persons on the security of houses sold to them by local authorities under the powers of Section 79 of the Housing Act, 1936, as amended by the Clause. That would give a monopoly to a local authority, and from that monopoly would flow several evil things, which are not to the advantage of the purchaser. The Amendment would not carry out what, I believe, the hon. Member had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, a local authority can only "advance money on the actual selling price of a house. If, therefore, a man purchased an old house, which he wanted to improve or on which he intended to carry out some repairs, he would not be able to borrow money on it because the local authority are precluded under the Section from lending money for that purpose. The purchaser, therefore, would be limited simply to getting money on the initial purchase price of the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man might want to modernise or improve a bathroom, or make good an old garage. The Amendment would preclude him from getting money for that purpose, and would place him at a grievous disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has entirely misunderstood the point that my hon. Friend was making. This is the point that we are seeking to make from this side about the financial activities of building societies, finance corporations and others who are interested in lending money for the purchase of property. This business will not be transacted in a vacuum. Taking a reasonable view of probabilities, once powers are held by local authorities to dispose of public property in this way, the sale of property would actually be stimulated and encouraged by the building societies and by those who lend money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the effect of the Amendment would be to give to a local authority a monopoly in lending money to a prospective purchaser.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
some authority on local financial matters. I did not say so—presumably he takes it for granted. Let us be perfectly clear that this proposed sale of council houses is not limited to sitting tenants. Under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, a mortgage already granted can be added to from time to time by a local authority for improvements. I do not think there is any doubt about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was by endeavouring to read the hon. Member's mind that I came to the conclusion that he was an expert on local government affairs. The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act would not enable a man to purchase a house if he was a sitting tenant. Most sales must necessarily be to sitting tenants, at any rate, in the early stages, until more houses are built or houses become vacant and local authorities decide to sell them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sparks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a very important statement. Is he now telling the Committee that a sitting tenant of a council house is not eligible to secure the benefit of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act for the purchase from the council of the house in which he lives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told—I asked particularly about the point this morning—that a person can only use the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act to acquire a house. If he is already a sitting tenant in a house, he has no need to acquire it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sparks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman assured me in a previous answer that the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act could be used for the purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will send for the appropriate section and when it arrives I shall read it. I wanted to have that point clearly in mind in trying to discover the effect of the Amendment. Under Section 79 (1, 	<i>d</i>), a local authority can allow only part of the purchase money to remain outstanding on mortgage. If a man wanted to improve or to repair his house, he could not get any money under that Section to do so. He could not use the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act because he is not acquiring the house—he is already in it. That man, therefore, would be deprived of getting money for improvements and repairs, which, I am sure, was not the intention of the hon. Member for moving his Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
The second disadvantage of the Amendment is that a local authority cannot always offer schemes as attractive as those which genuine lenders can offer. What about an insurance company who lend money with a combined endowment assurance? What about an insurance company who make an extra payment, so that if the purchaser dies all outstanding payments on the house are met and the property is left to his widow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure from what the hon. Gentleman has just said that he simply does not understand the question. The actuarial basis of insurance company contracts in financing house purchase is very cleverly and correctly calculated to include a whole life premium in respect of a man's death, and it may be equal to the purchase price of the house. In other words, an equalised premium is paid over a term of, perhaps, 20 years, in equal monthly or quarterly payments, and the payments include a percentage in respect of whole life assurance. It is irrevelant to compare the acquisition of houses in this way with what happens with the Public Works Loans Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be better if we had a debate rather than an argument like this. Perhaps the Minister would not give way so often, and then we might have a better debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price) rises to his feet, he looks so fierce and truculent that I am forced to resume my seat because he is so terrifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by the hon. Member may or may not be a good one, but a local authority cannot combine life assurance and the repayment of the outstanding mortgage, which to a tenant may be a more attractive scheme. It may not be so to the hon. Member, who, perhaps, may not expect to die for many years, but there are people, particularly those in failing health, who want to provide for their wives and who may decide to take out life policies in conjunction with their repayments. If anyone wants to look after his wife or family in that way, it is a very desirable thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third disadvantageous effect of the Amendment would be to deprive a tenant from borrowing from friends or relatives. He would be confined to borrowing solely from a local authority. He could not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
borrow even from his colleagues. If a Parliamentary Secretary wanted to borrow from his Minister to purchase a house, the Amendment would not permit him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were the other way round, he would get the sack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A person like myself would be deprived of getting financial aid. In many cases people borrow from relatives, and I have often lent very small sums to relatives, and I have generally lost the relative and the money also. If ever I managed to persuade someone to share the rest of her life with me, I should expect my mother-in-law to give me a reasonably large mortgage on whatever house we intended to live in, but the Amendment would deprive me of that. The last thing that the hon. Member had in mind would have been to prevent a Parliamentary Secretary walking to the altar and acquiring matrimonial status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend thinks that the Amendment is what one would call "grandmotherly legislation." It tries to protect a tenant from a genuine insurance company or building society who might want to lend him money. It deprives tenants of many advantages. Surely, the thing to do in legislation is to allow free choice. Let a man decide whether the local authority, the insurance company or the building society can give him the best of terms and the best advantage. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his Amendment, because of the extent to which it goes and because it precludes and deprives the sitting tenant from a number of advantageous services which ought to be at his disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking for myself, there is one figure in the Amendment that I should not regard as of first-rate importance: that is, "within four years." This is, of course, only a very limited provision, and I want to make one or two things clear to the Parliamentary Secretary. Far be it from me to investigate too closely the relations within the Parliamentary Secretary's family, but I point out to him that people are more than usually suspicious of one another if they never borrow or lend money except on mortgage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the whole of his speech, the hon. Gentleman kept on talking about borrowing as though it were borrowing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
with which we were concerned. What we are concerned with in this Amendment is whether the house in question should be used as security for borrowing. There is nothing whatever to prevent a person borrowing on other security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The person may not have any other security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I am coming to. We are trying to provide that for a limited period—I am not sure that it need necessarily be as long as four years—a purchaser shall not mortgage or charge the house which he has bought from the public authority, except by way of using the powers of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) in Section 79 (1) of the 1936 Act: that is to say, by taking advantage of the provision under which the local authority can let some of the money remain on mortgage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that on any view of the matter—we have not come to it yet, and I cannot discuss it in detail—there is, or may be, some right or pre-emption by the local authority. We should complicate the matter pretty badly if we were to have this sort of position: first, a sale by the local authority, then a mortgage to, say, a building society, and then the right of pre-emption by the local authority if the man wants to sell again. We should be opening the door to a dangerous extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think there is any reality in the point that improvements and so on would be prevented. One does not really suppose that local authority houses would all be sold in such a state that they must be propped up immediately. It is perfectly simple for the improvements to be made before the sale if need be. I should have thought that if the man was really in a position to buy his house and wanted to spend money on improvements—one does not know the exact proportion of the improvements to the value of the house—he would very likely borrow for the improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That kind of suggestion, coming from the Tory Party, is very odd. They tell us that we have got to have economy, that the country is in a desperate state, that only they can save it, and all the rest. Then they seem to contemplate encouraging people to spend and borrow, in this instance, more than they can really afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is just that sort of thing about which my hon. Friend and I are afraid. I believe that the danger which was put to the Parliamentary Secretary is perfectly real. I do not say that all building societies are malevolent, or anything of that sort. But at present they have not the least difficulty in lending any money they can borrow. We are told that we are to have some healthy competition, but where is the money to come from? I thought we were all against inflation. That is what we have been told by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet here we are to provide another new channel for the building societies to use when in fact, I think it is true to say, they do not have the least difficulty about using any money they can borrow. I have seen a number of their reports. They say that it is all right and that they are very selective about the advances they make. But why at this moment do we want to open the door further in a complicated and difficult way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do open the door we shall not get the reputable building societies, but we shall attract people who want to make a good bit of new business out of this, and who will induce people to buy houses by playing on the feeling possessed by a great many people that they would like to own their own house. We shall be inducing people to a form of extravagance which, on that ground alone, is not a particularly good thing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only that which bothers me. If we sell a house to a man and if we put him in the position of borrowing not from the local authority who, because they are a local authority, would always be there, but from somebody or other in London or miles away, we set up three interests in the house: the purchaser, the person who has lent and the local authority which has the right of preemption. What we are doing is to tie the man there because he cannot get out of the mess in which he will find himself. It will be far harder to get out of it if, for a good reason of his own, or in the national interest, he wishes to move and get employment somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of not having a local authority mortgage, but a mortgage with some outside body, will tie him to the ground far more. I am sorry that the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), has left the Committee, but I am sure the Minister will see the point. I am afraid that what the Tory Party will do, in the hope of making a property-owning democracy, will be to produce an undoubtedly large number of serfs "tied to the glebe," as the mediaeval phrase went.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These people will be restrained by their mortgage in favour of a building society, or some other less reputable lender; restrained by the municipality's right of pre-emption; short of a job, owing to the violent deflationary policy of the Tory Party and the games they have been playing lately with the Bank rate, the Budget and what-not. They will find themselves unable to work, unable to pay interest on the house, and unable to move out of this remarkable burden which has been imposed on them by this somewhat ill-considered legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that kind of reason that I wish to simplify this matter. We have the machinery of Section 179 (1, 	<i>d</i>). Is there any real reason why we should be so devoted to the fetish of free competition that we should unnecessarily complicate what ought to be in the interests of the purchaser, the local authority and the country as a whole, a perfectly simple transaction of the type contemplated in Section 179 (1, 	<i>d</i>) of the original Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope we shall get a reconciliation on this matter between the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a matter of free competition. What we are concerned about today is whether, generally speaking, in the case of people who are allowed a loan to purchase these houses, the normal means of borrowing from the local authority will be allowed. It appears to me that the words of the Parliamentary Secretary completely rule out the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act. I do not necessarily agree with his interpretation, but it is rather difficult to be faced with this sort of statement across the Floor of the Committee. I know of sitting tenants who have bought their houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From private owners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From private owners. The Parliamentary Secretary, who speaks with authority on building but, if I may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
say with respect, with less authority upon the financial structure of local authorities, seemed to say that it was impossible to lend money under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act to sitting tenants. He did not qualify that by saying that he meant sitting tenants envisaged under this Bill and occupying council houses. That is why I express surprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has cropped up before and the Minister was rather indecisive, as if he was making up his mind. The hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) said at the Sixth Sitting of the Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think it is clear that, under Section 79 of the Housing Act of 1936, there is provision for the lending of money by local authorities to those people who wish to buy houses under that Act, so that it is not necessary to work under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act. There is no need for the Minister to take special powers to do this, because he is not altering the 1936 Act. except amending it as far as the sale of houses is concerned."</p></blockquote>
As a matter of fact the hon. Gentleman with his great knowledge of local government—I believe he is chairman of the Borough of Kensington Housing Committee—suggested to the Minister a way out of the hole. But the Minister did not rise to that bait at all. Following that statement my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I merely wished to point out that the purchaser from the municipality ought not to be placed in a different position, in regard to the rate of interest,"—</p></blockquote>
This is an important point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"from that of another purchaser who wished to avail himself of the provisions of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, under which the rate of interest is controlled. My reason for doing so is that the Minister, at the end of his speech, mentioned the building societies."</p></blockquote>
So that within that context we have the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, the power under Section 79 of the 1936 Act, and the private building societies. That is all very well, but it seems now that we are in the dilemma of not knowing whether any of these are to be accepted as a medium for buying council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has left the Committee, and perhaps that is just as well, because he did not know what he was talking about when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think we have strayed a very long way from the Amendment"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
The Minister has strayed from the Committee Room at the moment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"into discussing the variety of methods by which the purchase of house or other property can be financed in a way that is helpful to the saving member of the community. My hon. Friend"—</p></blockquote>
That is the hon. Member for Dulwich—
	<br><blockquote><p>"who knows a great deal about these matters, has recalled to my mind one method, but there are many others, and, surely, this is not a matter which it would be necessary to write into this Clause, and still less—although I will consider it—to put as a minimum condition in my circular to the local authorities."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee A,</i> 21st May, 1952; cols. 256-7.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that we shall have from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary a clear indication of what method is to be allowed; whether the three methods will be allowed, whether the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act will be retained, or whether this is to be the private preserve of the building societies. I put it no higher than that. The Minister seems far from clear on the subject. I am sure that all the snags concerning the selling of council houses never occurred to this Government before they started on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will receive a very dusty answer from the local authorities if it is suggested that building societies will find the money. I could have understood if the hon. Gentleman had said there was to be perfect freedom among the prospective purchasers. I hope there will be some assurance that the local authorities will not be arbitrarily divorced from these conditions of buying houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statement of the Parliamentary Secretary has come as a bombshell, and, if for no other reason, I think the Minister should reconsider the whole policy of the sale of council houses.

Let us consider the ridiculous position in which we shall be. A local authority, for example, has a house which is completed, and under its policy it will agree to sell the house as a new house. The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act can be applied to a new house, but, so far as a sitting tenant is concerned, the Act cannot be applied. The 1936 Act is suggested, or Section 4 of the 1949 Act. But Section 4 of the 1949 Act also refers to "acquiring houses." If this means that neither the Small Dwellings Acquisition

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
Act nor Section 4 can be used, people will be forced into the hands of speculative financiers or building societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the main, those persons acquiring new houses will be young married people. Those persons who will acquire houses as sitting tenants, if certain of our Amendments are carried, will be tenants of long standing. An important question to the ordinary purchaser is the length of time for which a loan may be obtained. That depends largely upon the age of the borrower. So we shall have the case of a person of 40 or 45 who is denied the advantage of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and the 1949 Act and most probably the 1936 Act as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will be forced into the hands of the insurance companies or the building societies, and because they are older than the normal age of a person taking out a loan for 20 or 25, or even 30 years—as can be done under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act—they will be debarred from those facilities. They will be forced to take up a short-term loan, or to secure an additional guarantor for the loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached the stage where the Government have had revealed to them the fallacy of this policy of council house purchase which they have initiated in Clause 3 of this Bill. They should take up the policy, which I suggested earlier, of encouraging local authorities to use the powers for building under tenant-purchase schemes, under which both Section 4 of the 1949 Act and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act can be used. If people are to be forced to borrow from speculative financiers, insurance companies or building societies, this policy of council house purchasing will be much less welcome than it normally would have been, even among Tory authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might make one point clear. It all depends on the interpretation of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act. The Government do not want to deprive the purchaser of the opportunity of using funds which local authorities have at their disposal under any Act. My right hon. Friend wants there to be free competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will go carefully into the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act to see whether
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
a local authority would be precluded from selling to sitting tenants in certain circumstances. The position is complicated by the fact that the owner is the local authority, and it depends on the interpretation. However, my right hon. Friend has no intention of telling local authorities that they shall not use the Act. They will be encouraged to use every Act on the Statute Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the interpretation is unfavourable, the sitting tenant might be deprived of the opportunity of getting money from local authorities and the balance would be unduly in favour of insurance companies. There is merit in what the hon. Gentleman has said. If it is found that there is difficulty about the application of the Act by the local authority, that will be looked into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since I spoke I have recollected certain properties which have been bought in this way. The local authorities have requisitioned houses because people went away. Later they bought them and put tenants into them, and then sold them under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act. If local authorities have gone as far as that, surely there is no difficulty? Did not the Parliamentary Secretary anticipate something I had no intention of saying in suggesting that I did not know what I was talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pargiter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act might want looking into. We want a specific assurance that, in that event, the Minister will move an Amendment at the appropriate stage to ensure that the Act can be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we might make a little progress if I put it this way. The Amendment limits the field from which a prospective purchaser can fortify himself with money. It says that he shall not borrow it on mortgage from a building society and that he must not pledge the house itself if he borrows the money from anyone except the local authority. There are, no doubt, arguments for that, but it limits the field, and they are not good reasons for passing the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is a little complicated. The Act can be used for the acquisition of the ownership of houses, and a loan
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
can, therefore, be made to a man who has bought the house under the Act. For this kind of transaction the procedure under Section 79 is probably much more convenient and more appropriate. This does not require the money to be raised by the local authority and then lent to the purchaser; it merely allows the authority not to be paid at once—if we can call that lending—but to postpone the period over which repayment is made. Whatever may be the technique of the Act, it is surely simpler to use the right to be paid by instalments existing under Section 79 (	<i>d</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that proposed to be done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems the obvious way. The other method is roundabout, because the local authority has to raise money and then lend it. That means getting permission from my Department. We may say that this shall be the only way in which the purchaser may pay, that he must borrow or pay instalments under the scheme envisaged under Section 79 (	<i>d</i>), but surely that is rather limiting the field. If a man wishes to buy a house, he may have some money and may want to borrow the balance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is more likely to want the extended period of repayment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should we stop the man doing that? Is there any harm in borrowing on a mortgage? Surely, people would feel that Parliament had rather cramped their style. While I have no doubt that in a great majority of cases people will make use of the convenience of paying by instalments to the municipality which is the original owner of the house, there may be cases in which for a variety of reasons they may wish to do it a different way and to borrow in all or in part from a society or an individual. Surely, we ought to allow the largest field for financing such transactions instead of trying to circumscribe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will see if there is any further point, but what I have said seems to sum up the position. In any case, I hope the Committee will decide not to limit the field. If there was any problem, surely the answer would be to extend the opportunities rather than to reduce them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitehison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman look at it also from the point
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
of view of the local authorities? He is talking about the liberty of prospective purchasers to borrow where they choose. He has said that the usual way would be to use the powers under Section 79 (	<i>d</i>), and I agree with that. Therefore, all we are considering is the rather exceptional instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because a loan or a postponed payment to the municipality is the obvious method to adopt, what alarms me is the type of lender who may be concerned. He may go one further than the municipality and lend too much or lend at too high a rate of interest. He will be an undesirable type of lender. During the comparatively short period that we have in mind, the local authority will still have the right of pre-emption. It will make it exceedingly awkward if, when the man in the house wishes to sell it, the municipality has to deal not only with him but also with someone who has lent too much or made an unduly profitable bargain on the security of the house. This brings in a type of lender who, by hypothesis, will be "introduced only in exceptional cases, and that alarms me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help feeling that, in pursuit of the notion of free competition in lending, the Minister will pile up trouble not only for the borrower-buyer but also for the local authority. If I thought that it was meeting a widespread need I should look at it rather differently, but I think it will meet only exceptional and dangerous cases. I hope the Minister will bear that aspect in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Committees have great educational value to those of us who are interested in local government because we learn a great deal as we go along. Section 1 of the 1899 Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority for any area may, subject to the provisions of this Act, advance money to a resident in any house within the area for the purpose of enabling him to acquire the ownership of that house… "</p></blockquote>
Section 2 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before making an advance under this Act in respect of a house a local authority shall be satisfied (	<i>a</i>) that the applicant for the advance is resident or intends to reside in the house, and is not already the proprietor within the meaning of this Act of a house to which the statutory conditions apply… "</p></blockquote>
There appears to be some conflict between the two. I hesitate to challenge the Parliamentary Secretary's statement because I know the great legal service he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
has behind him and he would not be advised to make his statement unless there were considerable grounds for doing so. Perhaps, for our general education, we could be told where the doubt arises in Sections (1) and (2) of the 1899 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not so much the doubt about the legalities as the common sense of it. Broadly speaking, the Act envisaged lending money to an individual to buy a municipal house. Therefore, money had to be borrowed to pay to the vendor. When the municipality proposes to sell its own house, there is no point in borrowing the money to pay itself and it would be more convenient to operate under the other Act under which it merely takes payment in instalments. That is the reality of it and that is what the Parliamentary Secretary had in mind. Where one is borrowing from outside one must raise the purchase price, but the obvious way in the other instance is to take payment by instalments. That is the difference between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Committee will now agree whether they wish to make this further limitation. I still hope they will not make it. For the convenience of the Committee, perhaps I might say something about Progress. I feel that it would be for the convenience of all if we could deal with the Committee stage before the Whitsun Recess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Bowles. Might we first get rid of the Amendment, and then the Minister might report Progress to enable him to make a statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind. The Minister is asking if the Committee can get on with the Bill. He is proposing to ask whether the Committee should sit tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning. No question of order arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is thought more appropriate, let us dispose of the Amendment and then I will say what I have to say. I did not want to wait until a minute to one o'clock in case some people had gone. I was contemplating giving oral notice—I have to do it under the rules of order—that I shall move a Motion tomorrow that we shall have a further Sitting after tomorrow morning in order to try to complete the Bill before Whitsun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
I think that perhaps we might make enough progress that we should not have to have very much of a further Sitting, but, under the rules, I have to give oral notice that I will move a Motion to that effect tomorrow morning. I have not, under the rules, the duty of making a precise Motion. I have to give oral notice that I will move a Motion. Concerning the times, I am sure that we want to meet each other's convenience. There are two possibilities, either that we meet tomorrow afternoon—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The Minister has not referred to the suggestion of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) about this matter. We want to make progress, but I want to know whether we shall be in order in discussing this part of the Minister's speech immediately after the Amendment is disposed of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is only saying that he has to give notice that he will move a Motion to sit tomorrow afternoon or on Thursday morning or at some other time. He is throwing out a hint. The matter is one we cannot discuss, but if it is controversial, I think we ought, perhaps—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very controversial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very good, let us get rid of the Amendment first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sparks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have risen about a dozen times, Mr. Bowles, but I have failed to catch your eye earlier. I do not think that the Minister has made this matter very clear concerning the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, and it would be advisable if he could give us an assurance that he will look into this question. He has referred to the procedure under the Housing Act, 1949, which has exactly the same disadvantages as the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act. The money which local authorities raise under the Housing Act, 1936, is raised from exactly the same source. Therefore, a local authority operating the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act will use the same procedure. I do not think that we ought to multiply the procedures under which local authorities can act. Therefore, I ask the Minister at least to say that he will look very carefully into the matter and not rule it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would be convenient to discuss together this Amendment and the following one—in line 25, to leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if so required by the Minister."</p></blockquote>
This, again, is one of a series of four Amendments, such as those with which we opened the proceedings this morning. It is designed to impose a limiting factor in the operation of this Clause. Its purpose is to require that the local authority shall impose conditions. At the moment, the Clause says that it may do so, and that it may do so again if the Minister so requires. We feel that this is unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it is desirable that there shall be an obligation upon a local authority which is selling houses, and therefore withdrawing them
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
guarantee if an Amendment is to be withdrawn, but, in this case, I will give the hon. Gentleman the guarantee he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, "That those words be there inserted."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 16; Noes, 18.</p>
	<p>from the pool of houses available for letting, that such conditions shall be applied.</p>
	<p>It may be that this is Parliamentary phrasing, and that it was not the intention of the Minister to draw the Clause as wide as it is drawn. I, therefore, move this Amendment to give the Minister the opportunity of accepting it, in which case it will be the first instance of his acceptance of a suggestion which we have made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is really a great disagreement of substance between us, but there is a difference on procedure. If this Amendment were accepted, it would then become part of the statute that the local authority must impose these conditions with the right of resale for ever and throughout all time, unless the Statute were amended. There might well be a period—let us hope there will be—when the conditions of scarcity, which make it right that in selling property there should be this power to limit the price on resale, might pass away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am not anxious to see what this Amendment proposes put into the Act, so that it is the duty, for ever and for all time, of every local authority selling houses under this system to have this condition limiting the price at which the house may be sold or let.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my intention, in issuing the instructions to them, to say that they are to impose these conditions, so that, in point of fact, we are agreed on what is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1951-1952V000P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
happen, and there is no doubt about that at all. I want to leave the matter open for some Minister who may succeed me, in happier times, when the housing shortage, perhaps, has been so dealt with that there are really no grounds for putting upon an ordinary freeholder this limiting factor the opportunity to remove that condition. It is my intention to see that, so long as scarcity and famine prices remain, these conditions should be imposed, but I do not want to write it into the Bill, because that means that it could never be taken out again except by an amending Bill. All of us who know what Parliamentary troubles are like appreciate how difficult it is to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept my statement that it is my intention, as I am sure it would be of any Minister of whatever party who succeeded me, so long as these conditions exist, to require the local authority to have rules of this kind. I do not wish to make it obligatory upon them for ever, because these conditions may well pass away. I hope that with that assurance, while I understand what the hon. Gentleman wants to do, he will agree that there is no need for it to be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will go further than merely to accept the spirit of the Amendment. He has accepted the spirit of quite a lot of Amendments which we have put forward, but, by some peculiar process, not one of them has got into the Bill. I do not blame the Minister for that, but it is not encouraging for us to be given only these vain promises of consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one coming very soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that he did not want the Amendment to operate beyond the time of scarcity, but there will be this scarcity for many years, and nothing which this Government have done in connection with the housing programme will change that. In fact, in the current issue of one of the influential journals of the building industry, the point is made that private builders, because they have not got the land on which to build, will find in a very short time that their building programme has been brought to a standstill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
That is an expression of view by a journal representing the private builders, and I think it is a tragedy that it should be so. If their programme is brought to a standstill, there will not be much help from the private enterprise side of the building industry towards solving the housing problem. The local authorities will have to be given a great deal more freedom and will require a good deal more pushing to solve the housing shortage, in its broadest sense, in our lifetime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harmar Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman give the name of the authoritative journal which makes that statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is made in an article in "The Builder" of this month on page 749. The article is written by a man named Robert W. Porter, an expert on these matters, who has been writing in that journal and dealing with housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not the journal itself, but a correspondent to that journal, which was expressing that view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is expressed in an article in that journal, and it is not accompanied with the usual comment that it does not bind the editor. That is what the writer said in an article in that journal. The actual words are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unless builders are able to acquire extensive plots of land in the near future at reasonable prices, the private enterprise side of the building programme may be brought to a standstill."</p></blockquote>
The danger is that the private enterprise sector of house building will come to a standstill for many reasons, partly due to the point mentioned in this article, and partly due to the way in which the Town and Country Planning Act is operating. I said that when the Bill was going through, and hon. Gentlemen opposite did not. There will be a scarcity, and, therefore, there should be this provision giving the local authorities the instruction that they must put in a condition such as is laid down in the two following subsections of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the Minister's objection. Earlier, he told us he could not accept an Amendment because it imposed on him duties and responsibilities which he did not want. My hon. Friend the
