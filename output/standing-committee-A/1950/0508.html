	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee at its rising this day do adjourn until Tuesday, 5th June, and that during the further consideration of the Mineral Workings Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays and Tuesdays."</p></blockquote>
I hope that we may make good progress with the Bill, as I am sure we shall, because there are no points of fundamental difference dividing us. I hope that it may not be necessary to have many more Sittings when we resume our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that it will not be practical to meet on the day that Parliament re-assembles, as we might have more difficulty that day than we have had this morning in getting a quorum. I think that the first meeting which we could conveniently convene would be on Tuesday, 5th June. As I indicated last week, I think that it would be well to provide for two Sittings a week thereafter, although I hope that not many weeks will be necessary to conclude the Committee stage. I, therefore, propose that we meet on Tuesday, 5th June and on Wednesday, 6th June, on the subsequent Tuesday, and, if necessary, on the following Wednesday. I understand that that will be convenient for the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Blackburn, West (Mr. Assheton), whom we are sorry has not found it easy to attend on Tuesdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Motion. My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn, West (Mr. Assheton) is not usually able to attend on Tuesdays, but he is able to come on Wednesdays. I think that it will be for the convenience of everyone to know in advance that the Committee will be meeting on Tuesdays and Wednesdays until the Bill is completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the right hon. Gentleman has given me

	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(CONTRIBUTIONS FROM IRONSTONE OPERATORS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 3, after "therein)," to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in such other area as the Minister may by order prescribe."</p></blockquote>
I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we discussed this Amendment together with the following Amendment in page 3, line 4, at the end, to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An order made by the Minister under this subsection shall be of no effect unless it be approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
We on this side of the Committee are anxious that there shall be statutory provision to ensure that where there are opencast ironstone workings there shall be an effective means of ensuring that they are restored. As the Bill is at present drafted its effect is confined to the areas comprised in the ironstone district set out in the First Schedule. It is quite true that the ironstone district includes all the areas which are at present being worked and where restoration is a great problem. It is, of course, to be hoped that the same problems will not arise in other parts of the country. We are satisfied that for the time being, at any rate, the Bill shall be confined to the ironstone district as defined in the First Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, it is impossible to be sure that with the greatly increased demand for steel and the effort which we are making in this country to provide as much as possible of our raw materials ourselves the same problem will not arise in other parts of the country. It is for that reason that we on this side of the Committee desire to provide in the Bill a certain flexibility which is not provided at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us desirable that the Minister should be able to extend the operations of the Bill by order. At the same time, we are anxious that Parliament shall retain its control over so considerable an extension of the effect of the Bill as would be involved in extending it to other areas, and, therefore, we propose that the order made by the Minister under subsection (4) shall be of no effect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>403</span>
unless it is approved by Resolution of each House of Parliament. I ask the Minister to consider the amount of unnecessary trouble that would be involved for himself or his successors if it was desirable to extend the operations of the Bill and a special Bill had to be introduced in order to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might remind him of one instance of this kind in which I played a small part, and which may be of interest to him later. About 1934, the late Mr. Oliver Stanley introduced a Bill to deal with what we then called the distressed areas. Some of us moved an amendment to enable additional areas to be included by order, subject to an affirmative Resolution of the House. That was opposed at the time. It was not long before it was considered desirable to extend the areas to which the legislation and similar legislation applied. There is nothing to be lost and there may be much to be gained if the Bill contains an Amendment of this kind. I think that it would combine, at the same time, the speed and flexibility of administrative action and the retention of legislative control by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Planning (Mr. Lindgren)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To save the time of the Committee, I say at once that we accept the principle of the Amendment. I am advised by the Parliamentary draftsmen that there is a slight difficulty in regard to the wording, and particularly in regard to the word "or." If the hon. Gentleman will accept our assurance that we accept the principle, we will include on the Report stage a suitable Amendment to cover both points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Parliamentary Secretary. It is most satisfactory to know that he accepts the general principle, but I notice that I must postpone once more that day to which I am looking forward when it will be possible for amateurs to draft an Amendment which will be considered satisfactory by the Parliamentary draftsmen. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 38, after "ironstone," to insert "by opencast operations."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the addition of these words will merely clarify the Clause, because by paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule the calculations made in consequence of this Clause only take account of opencast workings, and if the value attributable to opencast workings is nought then no contribution is possible. Nevertheless, when the Bill was before us on Second Reading, I think there was a widespread impression that ironstone workable by any means was liable to attract to the owner the obligation to pay a contribution under this Clause. I, therefore, suggest that it would be an improvement to the intelligibility of the Bill if the words "by opencast operations" were not only in the Schedule but also in the body of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept the Amendment as drafted without any further amendment by the Parliamentary draftsmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 4, to leave out from "section," to the end of line 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment concerns a more substantial point. The words that I propose should be omitted enable the Treasury, in the scheme which they make under Section 58 of the principal Act, to lay down the manner in which questions as to who is liable and to what extent he is liable are to be determined. The ground on which I would prefer to see these words omitted is that it is for Parliament and not for the Treasury to decide how the application of any Act of Parliament is to be determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, of course, unless any other provision is written into an Act of Parliament, the interpretation is referred to the courts. In certain circumstances, where it has been thought more convenient, it has been laid down in an Act that decisions shall be taken by other tribunals or by Ministerial authority. But it seems proper that it should be Parliament itself which decides whether an interpretation other than from the courts should be admitted.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here in this subsection we are leaving it to the Treasury, under regulations, to say what tribunal, if any, there shall be for determining these questions. It is idle to argue that the regulations will come before both Houses of Parliament for affirmative approval, and that there will be an opportunity to object if the method proposed for determination is found to be unsatisfactory, because everyone knows that it is quite impracticable for Parliament to criticise with success any particular detail. It would seem, therefore, greatly preferable, if the courts are not the proper authority to determine these questions, that we should write into this Bill what is the proper authority and the proper method. Possibly the details might be left to regulations, but the principle should be settled in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will not pray in aid, if it is their intention to resist this Amendment, the fact that under the principal Act Clause 58 allows for a scheme to include provision for the determination of questions, etc. The words which I propose to leave out are, in fact, found in Section 58 (4, c) of the principal Act. As I am reminded, it is more than probable that that Section was not discussed at all by the House of Commons at any stage because of the operation of the guillotine. I confess that I do not feel myself bound by the precedent of the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another reason why we should not hesitate to depart from that precedent in this case. We are here introducing into a scheme under Section 58 a new range of questions. There is the question of whether the value is attributable to opencast, and if so what direction should be made as a result. These are different kinds of questions from those which may fall to be determined under the Section 58 scheme. Therefore, there is no anomaly created, even in the light of the provision in Section 58 of the principal Act, if we here state on the face of the Bill what tribunal should determine these questions. I feel that the Committee would be wise to omit these words, and leave the determination of the questions arising under this Clause to the jurisdiction of the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
them for a few moments on what my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) has described as a substantial point, and in connection with which we are coming to one of the more complicated parts of this not so simple Bill. My hon. Friend has referred to the provisions of Section 58 of the principal Act, and if the Committee will look at this Amendment they will see that its effect would be to leave the provisions in this Clause in the same position as the provisions in Section 58 governing the main Treasury scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee look at Section 58 they will see the sort of matters which it is contemplated shall be prescribed in the scheme set out in subsection (4) of that Section. All the matters provided for in that Section are, of course, a very long way away from the matters sought to be provided for by the words which my hon. Friend has moved to delete, because this Bill, as drafted, would enable the scheme to contain provisions for the determination of payments out from the ironstone royalty owners, whereas the whole of Section 50 is concerned only with the provisions defining who shall be the recipients of payments out of the fund. That is, of course, the cardinal difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that the words which my hon. Friend moves to delete are in no way 	<i>ejusdem generis,</i> as the lawyers say, with the provisions contained in Section 58 of the principal Act. I submit to the Committee, and to the right hon. Gentleman in particular, that the test to be applied as to whether or not this is a reasonable provision is that if all that is involved is a mathematical calculation, it is, of course, quite proper that it it should be dealt with by the administrative machinery of the scheme, but where details of valuation are concerned that is not a matter for the administrative provisions of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind the Committee that, of course, the Treasury have no valuation duties at all under Section 58 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. It would be a most unfortunate thing if there were given to the Treasury in this subordinate Bill valuation powers which were properly withheld from them by the Act as passed by this House in 1947. If that test is the right one it is necessary to see how it works out in practice. What
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
is done here by Clause 4 (2) is to link the amount of the contribution to the formula contained in the Second Schedule. That is not permissive; it is, of course, a mandatory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That involves looking at the Second Schedule of the Bill, where the formula is set out. If I might briefly analyse the formula from the point of view of applying that test—that is to say whether it is a mathematical calculation or whether it is a matter of what may be broadly called valuation—there are four matters to be taken into account lettered respectively 	<i>a</i> to 	<i>d</i> Let us deal with those matters so far as 	<i>a</i> is concerned. That is the amount of the payments to be made under the Section 58 scheme, and that is, of course, in the knowledge of the Treasury, so there can be, I apprehend, no objection to that point being settled by the administrative procedure of the scheme. So I concede a.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next we have 	<i>b,</i> which relates to the development value of the interest as ascertained for the purposes of the scheme. Of course, whatever this Bill may do when it becomes law, 	<i>b,</i> that is the development value, will continue to be ascertained in accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 61 of the principal Act. Therefore, so far as the application of 	<i>b</i> to the scheme is concerned it will, as I understand it, be merely a matter of reporting, because once the development value has been ascertained in accordance with Section 61, the Treasury, in the furtherance of that scheme, have no option but to adopt the development value properly arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may perhaps concede 	<i>b</i> with this proviso—the Committee appreciate that if there is a disagreement in ascertaining the development value under the terms of Section 61. then there is a right of arbitration before the Lands Tribunal under Regulation 13 of the Claims for Depreciation of Land Values Regulations, 1948. In the case of 	<i>b,</i> I would summarise it by saying that the Treasury would only, in fact, be applying a figure which has already been ascertained either by agreement between the parties or found by arbitration in default of agreement, and in either case by prescribed statutory principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
The same thing applies broadly in the case of 	<i>c,</i> which, as the Committee have observed, is such part of the
	<br><blockquote><p>"development value as is attributable to the prospect of winning and working ironstone by opencast operations."</p></blockquote>
There are, of course, claims put in under Section 58 in respect of minerals—overlapping claims in the sense that some land that has a mineral development value has in many cases a development value in respect of other potential development. But in the course of the higgling between the parties and the Central Land Board, or in the course of arbitration in default of agreement, the overlapping aspects have to be cut out, in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act. It is fair to say that 	<i>c</i> is governed by the same considerations as 	<i>b,</i> and it follows that in respect of those parts of the formula there is nothing very wrong in leaving the application of the formula to the Treasury scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to 	<i>d</i> we are on rather different ground. If the Committee will be good enough to look at the Second Schedule they will see that d is defined there at some length. Now the effect of 	<i>d</i> in the Second Schedule is to assume a hypothetical or notional lease for the purpose of calculation in respect of this formula. We are no strangers to the provisions of hypothetical and notional leases and all the complications that arise therefrom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a hypothetical tenant in respect of rating; a hypothetical tenant under Section 2 of the Compensation (Defence) Act in regard to compensation for requisitioning; a notional lease under Section 52 of the principal Act of 1947 in regard to the assessment of compensation for compulsory acquisition; and in all those cases—and I speak here as one with some experience in these matters—there are a great many complexities, variations and difficulties arising out of the application of these various hypothetical and notional leases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Second Schedule under this Clause is to add further a notional lease in working out the assumed average royalty, which is 	<i>d</i> in the formula contained in the Second Schedule. The working out of this may well raise a difficult problem as to the application of all hypothetical and notional leases, which various Acts of Parliament force us to assume for a variety of purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complications are obvious. If hon. Members will look at paragraph 4 of the Second Schedule they will see that in the first place it is necessary to arrive at an average royalty, in itself no easy thing to do. Secondly, not only is the lease hypothetical but it is retrospective, going back to 7th January, 1947. Thirdly, as hon. Members will see from sub-paragraph (	<i>c</i>), there is a reference to the customary covenants in regard to dead rent or restoration after working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the last Sitting of this Committee there was abundant contradictory evidence given by hon. Members with experience as to what was customary in regard to leases in the ironstone areas. Here is this provision, relating to customary covenants for the payment of dead rent or restoration after working, but all these matters are hypothetical and uncertain, and are to be annexed to the retrospective lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these matters, according to the Clause, will be dealt with in the Treasury scheme by an administrative stroke of the pen. I hope that the Minister will concede that I am approaching this matter fairly objectively, and have sought to prescribe a test and to relate the various parts of the formula to that test. I have conceded, in three out of four cases, that I see no insuperable objection to the application of the Clause as it stands and to dealing with these matters by the Treasury scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot concede, for the reasons I have given—I am afraid at some length, but this is one of the more important and difficult problems—that the formula d can properly be left to the administrative determination by the Treasury scheme. It is a matter which is new and, therefore, unlike the ascertainment of development value, there is no provision for arbitration in regard to it in the principal Act. Really, on analysis, this matter falls, as it were, at the last fence. The right hon. Gentleman is putting far too much responsibility on the administrative procedure of the Treasury scheme, if this Clause is left as at present drafted, and the scheme is allowed to determine questions of liability which will involve not merely the application of a mathematical formula, which I concede the Treasury are competent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
to do, but also matters involving difficult questions of law and valuation, for which surely some more seemly procedure should properly be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. Gentleman and to others who have spoken on this Amendment. They may perhaps be reassured if I say that it is my intention to accept the Amendment which will come next, in the name of the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Nugent), in which the Lands Tribunal will be given jurisdiction. If we could have taken the two Amendments together I could have said this earlier, and that might have removed some of the apprehensions felt by hon. Gentlemen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Amendment stands, arbitration is still to be among the incidental and consequential provisions referred to in lines 2 and 3. Arbitration would not be removed, and the words proposed to be left out by the Amendment were included to make it clear that the scheme should provide for arbitration on the amount of development. I hope, in view of the statement that I intend to put the Lands Tribunal in the position of determining these matters, that the hon. Gentleman might not press his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman recognises the force behind the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend. I agree with him in his observations that without these words which the Amendment moves to leave out the scheme could provide for the very things to which the Amendment refers, and that these words are strictly unnecessary. At the same time, it has clarified matters to have them there. I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman recognises the necessity for being a little more definite—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —about the body which is to determine these questions. Still, recognising the desirability of some body being appointed for this purpose, I had in my own mind a little doubt whether the Lands Tribunal was quite appropriate for determining questions between the Ministry and the individual iron ore extractor. No doubt the right hon. Gentleman has considered that point very carefully. If he is convinced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>411</span>
that the Lands Tribunal will be the appropriate body for determining these questions, I see no objection to the course he proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the action which the Minister has forecast, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 5, after "determination," to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by the Lands Tribunal."</p></blockquote>
I will not argue the case for this Amendment because the right hon. Gentleman has been good enough to do it for me. It seems that there is a need for some independent authority, and that the Lands Tribunal, with its expert knowledge in dealing with disputes about compulsory acquisition, would possibly be the appropriate body. I am very glad that the right hon. Gentleman agrees to the principle of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to raise two points in regard to the Lands Tribunal. Is the right hon. Gentleman satisfied, or has he considered, whether or not there is a danger, at any rate in the next few years, of the Lands Tribunal being somewhat overloaded with jurisdiction? He will have in mind the fact that they will have expanding business to deal with in regard to arbitrations under Section 61 of the Town and Country Planning Act, and also with rating appeals, as the Local Government Act gets into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that there might also be some danger of a multiplicity of juridictions in regard to these questions of minerals. There is, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, the 1923 Act—the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act—which goes to the Chancery Division of the High Court. I see, in the Minerals Regulations, that there is provision for certain matters going to yet another tribunal set out in the Schedule to these Regulations, but whether that tribunal has ever met or has been appointed I am not quite clear. No doubt the right hon. Gentleman can enlighten us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which tribunal is this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am asking the right hon. Gentleman. I can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
tell him where he can find out about it—in the Schedule to the Minerals Regulations of 1948. Paragraph 9 (1) says, among other things:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a development charge is payable…in respect of the winning and working of minerals comprised in a mining lease which was in force on the appointed day. the royalty or other payment required to be made under the lease may be varied by the Tribunal prescribed by paragraph (4) of this Regulation so far as may be just, having regard to the amount of the development charge."</p></blockquote>
That is an important provision containing a possible power of varying mining leases. For that, there is a special tribunal set up and drawn from a panel consisting of a chairman and such number of other members as the Lord Chancellor may from time to time determine. If it is more convenient I will put down a Question to the right hon. Gentleman asking him whether the tribunal has been appointed.

I am a little apprehensive that these mineral questions are being spread over an inconveniently wide area of jurisdiction which will not make it easier for the people engaged in the minerals industry to know exactly where they stand in regard to these matters. As now proposed, they would be the concern, first of the Chancery Division of the High Court, secondly of the Lands Tribunal, and thirdly of this rather fugitive and not altogether hypothetical tribunal, details of which I am glad to see the right hon. Gentleman is conscientiously searching for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to give information upon this somewhat fugitive tribunal. It has not been appointed. It has not, therefore, met, and under Clause 27 it is supplanted by the Lands Tribunal. To that extent we shall minimise multiplication. There is a difference between the ordinary courts and the Lands Tribunal. There was a balance of argument in favour of using the Lands Tribunal, and I will, of course, watch any danger of its becoming overloaded. I rather hope it may not be, but that indeed happens to the ordinary courts. They become heavily overloaded. I would, therefore, think on balance that it is best, as the Amendment suggests, to give the jurisdiction in this matter to the Lands Tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to put to the right hon. Gentleman a question for consideration, and not because I am opposing his suggestion. As

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>413</span>
there is a serious possibility of the Lands Tribunal being clogged by too much work, I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman, while referring matters specifically to the Lands Tribunal, should consider the possibility of making provision for arbitration, as an alternative. Although the courts might get clogged—and one knows that they do—arbitration enables a short cut to be made, and here it might be an effective form of tribunal without getting into the difficulties to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-Smith) has referred. It might be convenient to have that power in specific cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I think about that suggestion and consider whether we shall put anything down on Report? I have an open mind about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may appear ungracious if, when the right hon. Gentleman has advised the Committee to accept two Amendments moved from this side of the Committee, I now say that I shall very much regret to see this Clause, even as amended, stand part of the Bill. However, I am consoled by the fact that this can scarcely come as a shock to the right hon. Gentleman, who will have been aware, from the Second Reading debate, of the objections entertained by many of my hon. Friends and myself in regard to the Clause. Briefly, I object to it because it is a clear breach of promise as between the Government and the subject. Its results, if properly understood, are such as no hon. Member would be prepared to support. I want, therefore, first to explain briefly exactly what the Clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the principal Act, certain development rights were taken away from their owners as at the appointed day, upon payment of compensation. That compensation was the value at that day of the rights of which they were being deprived. The actual Section of the principal Act which lays that down is Section 61, which prescribes broadly that the compensation shall be equivalent to the difference between the restricted and the unrestricted values of land at the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
appointed day. What happened was that by the principal Act the State bought something from its owner in the condition that it was at a certain point of time, that being the appointed day, 1st July, 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By Clause 4 we are now, in 1951, jobbing backwards. We are now saying, "We are changing the law. We are imposing duties upon landowners and developers which did not exist in 1947 and 1948; but we are going to assume that they did exist in 1948. We are, therefore, going to say that the unrestricted value of your land in 1948 was less than in fact it was. We are going to import into land values three years ago conditions which did not exist three years ago." In other words we are reducing the compensation which people are hereafter to receive for something which was taken from them by process of law in 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, not to put too fine a point upon it, stealing from them part of their property as at that date. The inequity of this proceeding will appear if one or two alternative cases are considered. Suppose that the payments under Part VI of the principal Act had already been made. They might possibly have been made. Suppose that they had been made last month. It would then have been impossible for Parliament, by this Clause, to reduce those payments retrospectively, which is what is happening. Are we then to say that as long as we can delay the payment of compensation for property which is nationalised we can, during that period, always job backwards and reduce it retrospectively? How long is this process to be continued into the future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose that the payment under Part VI of the Act does not take place for another two or three years, and that in those two or three years further legislation imposing burdens, restrictions and duties upon landowners and developers, is passed. Are we then to assume that they also were in force in 1948 and reduce the compensation accordingly. It becomes a matter of luck. If one's property is nationalised and one gets the cash, one is safe from this sort of retrospective legislation, but if the State can delay paying the cash for the property then, by this sort of legislation, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>415</span>
reduces the price which it eventually has to pay by creating assumptions that conditions when it acquired that property were different from what they were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case known to me which puts vividly the injustice of what we are doing. I have a constituent part of whose property is being compulsorily acquired by the War Office. It is at present being valued by the Lands Tribunal for the purpose of compulsory acquisition. It is already 18 months since notice to treat was given in respect of that property. In those subsequent 18 months considerable damage and dilapidation has occurred, but the Lands Tribunal will not say to my constituent "This property was in a good condition when the War Office gave notice to treat, but we notice that it has become dilapidated since then, and we are only going to pay you the dilapidated price." They will calculate what it was worth on the date when possession was deemed to pass, and my constituent has a legal right to that value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Government are proposing by this Clause is as if the Land Tribunal should say that, by virtue of waiting 18 months, this property has been able to deteriorate and, therefore, the War Office shall have it cheaper. That case not only incidentally confirms the anxieties expressed about the burden of work upon the Lands Tribunal, but it also emphasises the essential injustice of what is being done. Therefore, I am heartily opposed to this Clause. I cannot say I am opposed because it is unlawful, for whatever the King in Parliament determines—just or unjust, moral or immoral—is law; but I am against it because it is plainly unjust and plainly immoral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) has most eloquently attacked the principle of this Clause, and has pointed out the inequity of applying this retrospective provision so as in effect to diminish, in the case of a particular class of claimants, the compensation to which they are statutorily entitled under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. I wholly adopt and associate myself with his arguments in regard to that inequity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take the matter a stage further and query the practicability of this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>416</span>
proposal as it stands. It is very strange now, suddenly, in 1951, to link the question of lost development value with contributions to restoration from ironstone owners. That in itself is a strange proceeding and one which is being done at a very indeterminate time in the programme for the assessment of development value and the estimation of the amounts to be paid to claimants under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Second Schedule and the formula contained therein is in any case at present a mass of hypotheses and unknowns. I think the Committee would be interested, because the House was not informed on Second Reading, to know just how this strange formula was arrived at. I have already spent a little time this morning in analysing the formula. I do not want to repeat anything I have already said, but I should like to point out that as a good many of these factors are at present entirely unknown and hypothetical, it must follow that their relationship, which is the basis of this formula, is unknown and hypothetical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent some time last night trying to puzzle out how this formula was arrived at. There are three different considerations put in relationship to each other. There are the figures of 9 and 8. No doubt the Minister will explain just why those figures are chosen. I see that one of my hon. Friends proposes to substitute an appreciably lower figure above the line. Then there is the question of the relationship of 	<i>a</i> and 	<i>b,</i> which is one of the governing factors in the working out and application of this formula, and which is at present, and must be, entirely unknown and hypothetical. The 	<i>a</i> is the amount of the payment falling to be made, but nobody either knows or can know at present what is the average or expected relationship between the admitted development value and the claim made in respect of it. Yet those are precisely the considerations in 	<i>a</i> and	<i>b</i> which are to determine the amount of deduction to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to think that the Minister could give the Committee some answer in regard to the expected relationship, but I know perfectly well that it is impossible either for him—or perhaps I should say even for him—and certainly for anyone
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
else to attempt such an answer. The Committee have only to reflect upon the time-table of the Treasury scheme under Section 58 of the principal Act. There was a year for the lodging of claims. Then three years were to follow for the working out for development value and the consequent arbitrations in respect thereof. Then there was to be a final year for the making of the scheme and the prescribing of the payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are nowhere near the final year yet; we are only just over half way through the three-year period for the working out of the development values and the holding of arbitrations. The arbitrations have not yet started, and it is impossible for anybody even to say in looking at the formula how much the total amount of lost development value is. We have not even got anywhere near ascertaining a precise figure in regard to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is at present known is that there is so much claimed—I do not know how much, but no doubt the right hon. Gentleman does—in respect of lost development value. But how much of that will be recognised as fufilling the statutory requirements under Section 51 is, and must be, unknown. So it is impossible for anybody at this stage to say what will be the average relationship between the amount of a payment made and the amount of lost development value agreed to rank for entitlement under the provisions of the principal Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, the relationship of 	<i>a</i> to 	<i>b</i> is entirely unknown, because it is the relationship of two unknown factors to each other. If the amount of payment in relation to lost development value is to be higher that is generally expected, then that might well affect the formula, or 	<i>vice versa.</i> What I fail to understand is how this complicated formula came to be worked out on the basis of so much uncertainty and hypothesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I would add to my hon. Friend's indictment—that this provision is vicious and retrospective in the sense that it imposes a penalty on a selected class of persons—that, even taking it as a formula and assuming the principle was sound, it is premature because the formula cannot as yet be precisely ascertained or evaluated. It is a classic case
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>418</span>
of making the worst of both worlds. I agree with my hon. Friend that this Clause, even improved as it has been, by the entitlement to arbitration in respect of a formula, is nevertheless bad in principle and likely to be extremely difficult to work in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering the proposal that the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. I had hoped that I had softened up the critics a bit by the various Amendments I have accepted. Of course, it is still open for hon. Gentlemen to argue against the general principle that the ironstone owners should contribute to restoring past, present, and future damage in the iron ore fields, but I think that the House when the Bill received a Second Reading, took the view that this was just. I certainly took that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to the Second Schedule, and the algebra and all that, I will do my best to give such explanation as I can, but I judge that we should be multiplying our discussion if I now went into a detailed explanation of 	<i>a,</i> 	<i>b,</i> 	<i>c</i> and 	<i>d.</i> That would more naturally come when we reach the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), I would say that the 1947 Act did not make a provision to deal with this grave problem of the devastation—past and prospective—of large areas of these Midland counties. It did not make provision, as this Bill makes provision, for the raising of funds in order to finance the restoration of past damage and the prevention of future damage. It was accepted when the House considered the Second Reading that the three parties here set down should make their contributions—the ironstone owners, the operators, and the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems to me that the principle of this Clause cannot be resisted by anybody who accepted the Bill on Second Reading. I do not think it is reasonable to say that we are stealing anybody's property, except in so far as one might say that about any increase in the taxation of any property anywhere. It might be said that, if we increased Death Duty, we would be stealing people's property, but I would say that we would be imposing an additional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
charge on the property owner to meet new needs which have arisen since the charge was last fixed; and that is what we are doing here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the particularly grave problem of devastation of this land and the dereliction of a large part of it, and, in the process of putting right the finances, we must collect money from the people who should pay it. One class of these people is the class of ironstone owners. I cannot accept that there is anything immoral or unusual in that, because there are precedents for it in other directions. I cannot accept the general argument against this Clause, although we have accepted some arguments and the Clause has been improved thereby. However, I reserve any observations on the Schedule until we come to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister might have made some observations concerning the Schedule, if only to make some contribution to our being more informed and more helpful when we come to discuss the Schedule. That is what I have in mind, and I feel that it would be a convenience to the Committee. Neither on this Clause nor on Second Reading of this Bill have we been vouchsafed any clue as to how this formula was arrived at, what it is and why, and what is in the Minister's mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I cannot share the right hon. Gentleman's opinion as to what is just or equitable in this matter. As he knows, I have always pressed for something to be done with regard to restoration; indeed, it was not our fault that there was no provision in the 1947 Act to deal with that problem. According to my recollection, I pressed the Government at that time to do something about it, but nothing was done, for one reason or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the right hon. Gentleman is quite right in saying that there was no provision in the 1947 Act. If some provision had been made then, the position so far as this argument is concerned would be very different. When the right hon. Gentleman now talks about ironstone owners, that is now, in one sense, and has been ever since the passing of the 1947 Act, an inaccurate description, because the development rights since that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
time have passed away from them. They are to be compensated for what was taken away from them by the 1947 Act; at least, we hope so. The compensation will come out of the £300 million Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pausing there for a moment, the effect of that is surely that the rights and the duties of the ironstone owners so far as restoration is concerned underwent a very significant and important change in 1947. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will agree on that. Under that Act, compensation was to be given to the ironstone owners for what they lost. This Bill—and this is the point which my hon. Friend has put—says in clause 4 that the amount of the compensation which, under the 1947 Act, one was to receive for what one had parted with is now to be reduced by some contribution which one is to make to the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should it not be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary asks why should it not be. If he will only listen, light may dawn upon him. I am trying to put an involved argument quite briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What may happen is that extraction has begun to take place since 1947, and what the right hon. Gentleman considers to be just is that an owner of land who had a right to compensation after the passing of the 1947 Act in respect of the loss of his development values, will now, because of some subsequent operations on the land since he parted with his development rights—since he is no longer the owner of the development rights in respect of the iron ore—have to suffer a reduction of his compensation, to which he was entitled under the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has drawn attention to a defect in this Measure, and it does not rest with the right hon. Gentleman to say that, because this Bill received a Second Reading without a Division in the House of Commons, and has met with support from all who want to see this devastation stopped, we are, therefore, committed to the approval of what are, in my opinion, obvious and avoidable inequities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would agree with the right hon. Gentleman to this extent. I see no objection to those responsible for the devastation making a contribution, but I do not want to see this retrospective action,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>421</span>
which will lead to unfairness, and might, and probably will, lead to the penalising of people on whom no responsibility rests for the present state of affairs. That may happen, and I think will happen, under this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I say to the right hon. Gentleman that I cannot accept his view that this provision, as it stands, is either just or equitable, and I ask him to say that he will look at it again, with a view to ensuring that this burden does not fall on those who should not bear it, because they are not the guilty parties, and that the provision should not operate in such a way as to reduce the compensation under the 1947 Act because of work done since 1947, when the so-called ironstone owner is no longer the owner of the development rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important point. I do not know whether the point raised by my hon. Friend perhaps took the right hon. Gentleman a little by surprise, but it certainly is a point which requires careful consideration. I have always taken the view that the right solution to this problem of who should pay would be to throw the burden on the persons guilty of causing the situation, and, normally, they are the ironstone extractors. Then, the ironstone extractor who does not restore the land would quite rightly pay, and, if need be, he could, when he accepts the lease, make arrangements with the person from whom he takes the lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think this Clause will do in its present form. While I welcome the Bill, as I did on Second Reading, I ask the right hon. Gentleman to look at it again, because I feel that, in its present form, it will result not in justice but in injustice to many people on whom no responsibility rests for the devastation now existing in certain parts of Northampton- shire, though I am glad to say very little in my own constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to associate myself with what has been said by my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee about the retrospective operation of this Clause. I do not wish to repeat what they have said, but the right hon. Gentle- man misunderstood the argument when he drew an analogy between this situation and Death Duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point we are seeking to make about this Clause is that the Government, at the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
time when the present Minister was Chancellor of the Exchequer, bought a certain property. I remember very well the Minister's speech in the House of Commons, in which he said to his hon. Friends on his side of the House that the State was making a good purchase. In fact, what is happening now under this Bill is that, now that the Minister has gone to another Department, he is seeking to pass legislation to make that purchase even more advantageous than it was at that time. He is, in fact, cutting down the price which, at that time, he said was fair and reasonable to pay for the purchase of development rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that he has not seen his way to give us some explanation of the formula in the Second Schedule, and I say that because I believe that it really would have helped the Committee and, in the long run, would have shortened our discussions. If he is not prepared to do that today, and I quite realise that on so highly complicated a matter as this it might be impossible for him at short notice to give an explanation of it, I venture to suggest that it would be in order if there could be a general explanation of the Schedule, since the Clause we are now discussing refers to that Schedule and lays down the formula which is to be applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I considered that when the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) was speaking, and I decided that it was in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were possible for the Minister to help us in this way, I would ask him to do so. I have here a note which has been prepared by a mineral agent, who has tried to work out what would be the effect of the formula. I am not going to give a lot of figures, but will only quote four. If the royalty was 6d. per ton, and these other figures apply, the contribution would be just over £700, and, if the royalty was only 4d. per ton the contribution would be £978 per ton. The Minister might well be asked, says this agent, to clarify the formula and explain how and why it is so devised that a larger contribution is to be paid on a lower royalty. The agent goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be that my appreciation of the formula is not correct. I am by no means sure that I have correctly understood it."</p></blockquote>
It is because we are confronted with that situation that, if it were possible at this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>423</span>
short notice for the Minister to give a general explanation of the principles underlying this formula, it would enable us to study the matter in detail between now and the time when we reach the Second Schedule, and I am sure that our discussion on it will be more informed and probably very much briefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there are really two points involved here. There is the point which the hon. and learned Member for Northants, South (Mr. Manningham-Buller), and other hon. Members have raised about the number of persons on whom the charge ought to fall, and there is the question of the formula in the Schedule. Perhaps there are really three points involved. Perhaps there is also the broad general question of whether the provision made in this Clause for getting part of the contributions to the Fund is fair in its broadest sense, even if one makes the qualifications which the hon. and learned Member has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that, so far as the Clause itself is concerned, it would be very difficult to justify the omission of the ironstone owners, as a class, from the contributors to this Fund. I repeat that I do not think that, in the House of Commons, that view was put in that form. With regard to the Schedule, since several hon. Members have asked me to say something about it, I will do so, but I think that it would not be well to have a considerable development of the discussion. If I say something broadly now, it might well enable some further reflection to take place, and, when we come to the Schedule in which it is actually embodied, it will perhaps be proper for Amendments to be put down if any hon. Member thinks he can improve the formula. Therefore, in any preliminary remarks which I make now I will not go into great detail, because I think that would mean duplication. I hope that we will not have a long debate on the formula at this stage but will consider it when we reach the Schedule itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very broadly, the formula is for calculating a slice deduction to be made under Clause 4 from payment out of the £300 million Fund. The formula provides that the slice deduction—the diminution in the compensation to be paid—should bear the same relation to the actual payment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
as 1⅛d. which is the contribution laid down as the mineral owners' share of the 3d. per ton levy. The formula provides that the slice should bear the same relation to the deduction as 1⅛d. bears to a full, normal ironstone royalty. That is the basis of the ratio which is laid down in the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example. If the royalty for a particular piece of land were 4½d., shall we say, and if the Section 58 payment was £1,000, then the slice deduction would be 1⅛d. divided by 4½d. or on-quarter of £1,000, that is to say, £250. I remember an hon. Friend saying in connection with another Bill that a blackboard and a piece of chalk might be advisable, but I am afraid that we shall have to do without that auxiliary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ratio of the slice has to have the same relation to the payment made as 1⅛ to a full, normal ironstone royalty, which varies from one case to another. That is the first approach. There is the complication that in some cases the development value is attributable partly to ironstone working by opencast methods—and the Bill is concerned with opencast workings—and partly to working of ironstone by underground methods. That is one of the possibilities of the future. Many of us think that it may represent an increase in the operation of these workings. The development charge may also be partly attributable to some other form of development taking place on the land, such as the erection of houses and factories. In such cases, the slice only operates on that part of the development value which is attributable to the prospect of winning the ironstone by opencast methods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am following the right hon. Gentleman. Where the right hon. Gentleman was educated one had to learn things without the use of the blackboard. He used the expression twice, "full, normal ironstone royalty," but I take it that the formula makes no allowance whatever for the case where the royalty is based on the assumption that the restoration will be effective, and where the royalty is in consequence very much lower than the value of a normal ironstone royalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. and learned Gentleman for raising that point. I had contemplated that this

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>425</span>
was a matter which would be discussed, and I am anxious to have it discussed later. I do not propose at this stage to say more. The answer is that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is correct. That is a matter which I would be glad to have discussed in the Committee later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I express my gratitude to the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that the point made by me had not been made on Second Reading. I must correct that statement. If he will refer to HANSARD of 9th April, 1951; Vol. 486, c. 716–7, he will find that in the Second Reading debate that point was developed at length. It is perfectly true that no notice was taken of it by the Government, but that is a different matter. I cannot seriously believe that this point has been grasped by the right hon. Gentleman, because I do not believe that had he grasped it he could defend what he is doing in this Clause. I do not believe that he would defend the acquisition by the State of property at a certain date in its condition and at its value on that date, and then for the State to say, three or four years later, that because of things that had been done subsequently that value was less at that time than in fact it was. I can only hope that further study will bring the right hon. Gentleman to a better frame of mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 5.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(APPLICATION TO LAND HELD BY OPERATORS ON 1ST JULY, 1948.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 41, to leave out "twopence farthing," and to insert "one penny and three farthings."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the effect may not appear upon the face of this Amendment, the effect would be that the ironstone owners' contribution would be reduced to five-eighths of a penny from 1⅛d. That is to say, it is reduced to approximately one-half of the contribution required from the operator. The object of the Amendment does not stand or fall with the actual amount selected. The object
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>426</span>
of the Amendment is to establish the principle that the contribution required by this Clause, and obtained indirectly by the machinery of this Clause, from the ironstone owner shall be appreciably less than that obtained from the ironstone worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In introducing the Bill, the Minister said that the rest of the cost—I am referring to HANSARD, 9th April, 1951, col. 666—of the contribution to the Fund after the Treasury had made their 25 per cent. payment would be divided equally between the industrialists and the royalty owners. Let us make no mistake, that is not what is being done by the Bill. The burden is not being borne equally by the landowner and the operator. It is being borne far more by the landowner and far less by the operator. It appears on the face of the Bill, and on reading the Financial Memorandum, that they each pay 1⅛d.; but they do not. The royalty owner pays lid. because that is extracted from him by the machinery of this Clause. The operator, however, pays 1⅛d. but he recoups it to a large extent from two sources—from the consumer and from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He is the occupier for the purpose of rating and the rateable value of the land will undoubtedly be reduced as a result of these extra burdens, and of this reduced profitability of the ironstone operator, in so far as the burden is imposed on him, part is automatically shifted, through the rating machinery, on to the local authority and through the local authority on to the Exchequer. By far the greater part of the 1⅛d. will be paid, Mr. Bowles, by you and me and not by the ironstone operator. It is quite untrue to say that the burden of restoration is being divided equally between the ironstone operator and the royalty owner. The royalty owner pays the whole of the 1⅛d. and the operator pays only an indeterminable fraction but a much reduced fraction of the sum of 1⅛d.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supposing this shifting of the burden did not in fact occur. Supposing the machinery of the Bill in fact resulted in equal sums being paid by the two parties. I would still maintain that it was wrong that the burden should be equal. The burden ought surely to be distributed between the two parties in the way in which it would be distributed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>427</span>
between them in a free market as between a willing lessor and a willing lessee. If the two were making a contract knowing that between them 2¼d. a ton had to be paid on the ironstone extraction, then it is most improbable that as between a willing lessor and a willing lessee that 2¼d. would be divided equally between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the figures of the total royalties which are normally obtainable. It is perfectly true, as the Parliamentary Secretary said on the Second Reading, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Royalties in the ironstone industry vary from about one shilling to 2½d."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th April, 1951; Vol. 486, c. 749.]</p></blockquote>
But the general run of royalties is far nearer the lower than the higher of these two limits. Can it possibly be maintained that 1⅛d. out of a royalty of 2½d. or 3d. or 3½d. is fairly attributable to the burden of the restoration of the land after the extraction? It is impossible to come to the conclusion that this burden of 2¼d. per ton would, in a free market, in free negotiations be shared in equal amount between the two parties to a lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I say that on two grounds the provision in this Clause is inequitable. It is wrong on the ground that the burden is being shared equally because in fact it falls much more heavily on the royalty owner; and it is wrong on the ground that it should be shared equally. On those grounds, I move this Amendment to make a substantial reduction in the contribution ultimately obtainable through the machinery of this Clause from the ironstone royalty owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Amendment of my hon. Friend opens an avenue to a very important discussion on this Bill and one which may be rather wide in its nature. I would like to give to the right hon. Gentleman some figures with which I have been supplied in support of the proposition of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), that in fact the contribution which will be made by the iron ore extractors—the amount of the burden falling on their shoulders—will be very much less than the burden falling on the ironstone owners—although from the Explanatory Memorandum it would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
appear that it was intended to be an equal division of the total burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the effect upon the rates. I think it may be of interest to the right hon. Gentleman, if he has not seen these figures, if I give them to him. I will give them as briefly as I can. If we take the present output as being 4 million tons a year in Northamptonshire it would mean that the producers' contribution to the fund at 1⅛d. per ton would be £19,000 a year. The same, of course, would apply to the ironstone owners' contribution, which would be £19,000. I am told that the present rates are about £1 in the pound, and that the effect of putting this burden on the producers would be to reduce the rates paid by the iron ore extractors from £12,500 to £7,750.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although they are having the same burden imposed upon them in this Bill as the ironstone owners, in fact, it will prove a very much lighter burden for them to bear. The result will be that, in practice, taking the rating position into account, the ironstone owners will get no rate relief as a result of this payment, and will be paying £19,000, whereas if these figures are correct the ironstone excavators will only be paying £14,250, because one must take from the £19,000 the saving they will make in their rating liability of £4,750.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know to what extent the rating liability was taken into account in fixing the proportions to be borne by the ironstone excavators or the ironstone owners, but it seems to me that one must go a little bit further than to establish an equality which exists only on paper. I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that this is one ground upon which it seems desirable that there should be reconsideration of the formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I will not be trespassing upon the Rules of order if I now turn to a question which is very closely related to this Amendment—the application of the formula to the case where the ironstone owner has deliberately agreed with the ironstone excavator on a royalty which is far less than the normal royalty. It may only be 2d. as opposed to the normal royalty, and it may even be less than that in order to secure restoration. I am not defending and I have never sought to defend the black sheep who are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>429</span>
responsible for the devastation. Indeed, I have often attacked them. At the same time, it would be very wrong if we in this Bill penalised those who of their own free will, without any obligation cast upon them by legislation, took steps to ensure that the land for which they were responsible was not devastated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure I will have the whole of the Committee with me when I say it would be wrong to put an unfair burden on those who have set a good example to their fellows. This formula in its present form does that, and I press the right hon. Gentleman very strongly to say that he will make some adjustment in that formula to make provision in the case where it is clear that a lower royalty than the normal—and very often a much lower royalty than the normal—has been settled in consequence of the responsibility for restoration by the excavator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that certain colleges in universities have in this respect adopted a very proper attitude, and imposed very low royalties in consideration of restoration. The effect of the formula upon those colleges will be almost to extinguish the royalty payments which they are receiving. The same thing applies to quite a number of individual owners. If the right hon. Gentleman makes inquiries he will find case after case where the owner of land, be it an Oxford or Cambridge college or a private individual, has deliberately imposed a royalty which is less than normal with a view to ensuring that the land after excavation does not remain an eyesore and a wilderness, but that it may be brought back, it may be after some considerable time, into use, and to being once again an attractive part of an attractive county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to say that he recognises the force in these points, and that he will couple my last point with the fact that the burden cast upon the operator will be less than the burden cast upon the ironstone owners because of the rating position as well as the other grounds mentioned by my hon. Friend. I also ask the right hon. Gentleman to say that he considers there is a case for the revision of the whole basis of the formula so as to make provision to avoid penalising the man who has acted properly, and not make him pay for the sins of those who have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>430</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harmar Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I have anything new to say. What I have to say will merely repeat the points already made by my hon. Friends. However, I do not think that that is a bad thing, because this is a very important point, and it may help the Minister to see that many of us, who have given much thought to this problem, have come to the conclusion that it is important. If we have agreed that the contribution by the operator and on the landowner should be equal, then do not let us make it worse by making the landowner the bigger contributor than the operator. If we work it out to the last decimal point, it should be the landowner who should have an advantage, if there is any.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must accept the fact that the operator will have the benefits of this rating help, as the figures given by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Manningham-Buller) show. In one county in one year the operators will be recouped to the extent of £4,750. so that that is the rebate they will get from their 1⅛d. contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side, it is right to raise the question of the landowner who has deliberately accepted a lower rate of royalty in consideration of the operator promising to restore the land. I say no more about that. The points have been very well put, and I hope the Minister will treat this matter with great sympathy and be prepared to bring in some Amendment that will meet the point that if the operator is to have assistance from both the Fund and the rating, the landowner. who has a better claim, will not be put in a worse position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept this Amendment as it stands. I am sure that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), will not be surprised if I say that quite flatly. I must sustain the Fund, and I must get sufficient money into it in order to carry out the work of restoration which it is designed to finance. The Fund must be substantially sustained in the total agreed upon, nor would it be reasonable to put an extra demand on the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is to be 25 per cent. from the Exchequer, and I think that that is a fair deal between the Treasury and myself and between the Treasury and those concerned with this problem. Therefore, the only reconsideration that I can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>431</span>
give must be subject to those two considerations. With that stipulation I am quite prepared to listen to argument. I notice that the owners have more vocal advocates on the other side of the Committee than have the excavators. No one has spoken a word for these unfortunate excavators because they have suffered at any rate some degree of nationalisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The right hon. Gentleman can have his fun about that, but it is not on that account. Certain excavators, but only certain of them, are the villains of the piece, and have made this Bill necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle that I tried to argue was that there was some force in the suggestion that the excavators should have the help of a ld. valuation if it was more than 16,000 tons, and down to a ½d. if it were more than 26,000 tons, for excavation in one county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be fair to say that Members opposite are concerned with all the owners but only with some of the excavators?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to see that these productive elements, these enterprising men, these people who put their brains and to some extent their money into extracting iron ore in the Midlands—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are all agreed that restoration must take place and that there has been grave neglect and shocking
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
dereliction in the past. That is why I am discussing the Bill. I am only noticing that a great deal of the argument put forward by hon. Gentlemen opposite was in favour of shifting some of the onus from some of the owners to the excavators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my point altogether. I am certainly asking for some reductions, but I base it on the fact that the amount of money expected to be expended on restoration will be lower than the right hon. Gentleman has accounted for. I think the remedy is that we can make some reduction from the operator and the landowner, and that a Id. is what we have in mind, because many believe that the figures will be much lower than the right hon. Gentleman has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that because I must sustain the income. There can be no substantial diminution of the revenue. We cannot ask the Treasury for more than the contribution provided for. So we come down to the question of deciding between the different sections in this matter other than the Treasury—the owners and the excavators—and I am quite prepared to look at that matter again broadly and at the particular points that have been brought up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about rating was raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. That is being gone into at the moment by my advisers with the valuation office, but we are not so sure that there is anything much in it, as has been alleged. I will have a look at it with the best advice that I can get, and if there should be anything substantial in the point I will certainly indicate it to the Committee at the appropriate moment when we resume. The argument was that the excavator would get a very great advantage as compared with the owners by reason of the rating assessment. I am not so sure how far that is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to a further point, which was raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Manningham-Buller). I should say quite frankly that I am not wedded to an absolute flat rate upon the owners. I am quite prepared to consider whether it should be varied in some way. There are not a large number of them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
concerned. The argument against complexity is criticised when the number of cases is large. If we are dealing with cases running into millions then it is necessary to have a simple rule which can be applied without a great deal of departure from the normal—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume the right hon. Gentleman meant "a million cases" and not "£1 million."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman talked about cases running into millions. He, of course, meant millions of cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Let us take the case of the Income Tax. It is desirable that the Income Tax law should be as simple as we can make it, but we know that we cannot make it completely simple. However, variation from the general rule should be minimised when dealing with -a large number of individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case there are not, I imagine, more than a couple of hundred owners concerned, whether persons or institutions. Therefore, there is not the same argument for absolute simplicity in terms of administrative convenience. It is something which we have to consider, and I have not arrived at any conclusion about it. We have to consider whether we should not have a variation from the flat rate of 1⅛d, taking account of some of the factors which have been raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, let us take a very simple contrast. We may have one owner who has been conscientious and has not wished his land to look like one of those horrible deserts of the moon, to repeat a phrase I have previously used, after the iron ore has been extracted. He has made it a condition that there shall be restoration, and has imposed that condition upon the extractors. He has, therefore, been able to get only a lower royalty, compared with that obtained by another man who has had no care at all for the restoration of the land, and has allowed these horrors to develop by not imposing any condition upon the extractors. In this case the extractor has had an insufficient sense of duty, and he is one of the villains of the piece. As a consequence of the failure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
of the second landowner to impose a condition of restoration, and the failure of the extractor to do that restoration himself, the first landlord may have had to take a comparatively lower royalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As between those two men, the one public-spirited and the other not, there is a case for differentiation, but I have no proposal to put to the Committee as to just how that should be done. It is a reasonable case in equity, which certainly should be looked into, and I undertake to look into it. As a matter of fact, before the point was raised this morning, I received representations about one or two cases which might be of very great importance. Therefore, I accept the principle that there should be some differentiation from the 1⅛d.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will seek what formula would best serve for maintaining the total revenue substantially and approximately, while putting a somewhat heavier burden upon those who have not been conscientious in the matter and a somewhat lighter burden upon those who received a lower royalty, while keeping a clean conscience. That is as far as I can carry that point. I will look further into it. I am glad that it has been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other proposal which has been put forward would mean imposing a flat rate upon both the conscientious and the unconscientious. That I cannot accept, partly because it is not equitable and partly because it would diminish the Fund. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has made some progress upon this point. Originally, the machinery of the Bill imposed an equal burden upon the owner and the operator. The right hon. Gentleman has come this far, that he has recognised that the power of the operator to shift the burden, as contrasted with the inability of the owner to do so, means that the 'burden is not equally shared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be led into admitting what I have not admitted. I said it was worth looking into this question of right, but that I was not sure that it was as important as the other matter. I have not admitted that there should be any variation, and I do not at this stage admit it, between the owners in the total and the extractors in the total. I said that I would look into it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
again, but I am not prepared to admit that there should be any departure from the principle of equal division, subject to adjustment round about the average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I am right in saying that the 'Minister has realised that the equality of burden which he desired to obtain as between the owner and the operator is not necessarily obtained by an equal levy in monetary terms imposed under the machinery of the Clause as it stands. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that it is not only by way of rates, but by way also of passing on the burden to the consumer, that the operator is in an advantageous position compared to the owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed that the Minister was constantly saying that he would not accept a larger burden for the Exchequer than 25 per cent. Let us be quite clear about this. The Exchequer is paying to the Fund considerably more than 25 per cent. of the sums contributed under the Bill. Your attention, Mr. Bowles, will have been given to a later provision in the Bill in Clause 35 (5), which provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>"There shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament any increase attributable to the provisions of this Act in the sums payable out of such moneys under Part I or Part II of the Local Government Act, 1948."</i></p></blockquote>
That is to say, whatever the local authorities lose in the way of rateable value, small or great, as a result of these provisions, will be made up to them in large part out of the Exchequer. There is also the question whether Schedule A payments by the operators will not be reduced as the result of this extra burden. I think it ought not to go out from this Committee that the Exchequer's real contribution is only 25 per cent. of the amount going into the Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other observation I should like to make relates to the point raised by hon. Members and replied to by the Minister, in regard to the relationship between royalty owners who have obtained full royalty and those who have obtained less than full royalty in consideration of obligations which were imposed to restore the land. This matter was raised on Second Reading, when I ventured to suggest to the Government that they had already made provision for this matter in the Bill, and that the object of paragraph 4 of the Third Schedule is to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>436</span>
achieve precisely that effect. Perhaps this will serve the Minister as a warning that, if that is not the object of that paragraph, he should be prepared, when we reach the appropriate stage, to explain what paragraph 4 does. We can, however, register that some impression has been made upon the Minister by the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong for us to pass from this Amendment, and it would be ungracious on my part, if I did not take the opportunity, even at the cost of delaying the Committee for a moment or two, to express my thanks to the Minister for the spirit in which he has received our suggestions. I do thank him for that. I appreciate that it means that he will have another look at the whole thing, particularly in regard —if he will accept the phrase for one moment—to the good landowner who has fulfilled his obligations. The right hon. Gentleman has said—and I quite understand him in his position saying so—that he has to maintain the Fund. In spite of that, some of us feel that he estimates the cost of restoration higher than do some of us on this side of 'the Committee. I quite understand his taking up that position that the Exchequer contribution is not to be increased, and therefore, as he says, the field of manoeuvre is, to a certain extent, limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would suggest—and I think from what the right hon. Gentleman has said that he will value the suggestion—that to do justice within that field of manoeuvre regard must be had to the owner who, for the purpose of securing restoration, took a lower royalty. That will mean an increased contribution either from the other owners, or from the extractors, or from both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it from what the right hon. Gentleman has said that, while it may be difficult to attribute guilt and to decide responsibility between some extractors and some owners, when he considers this further problem he will not close his mind to the possibility of putting what he takes off the lower royalty owner on to the extractors as well as perhaps to some extent on the other owners. That is to say, whatever he takes off the lower royalty owners should be cast upon the other payers into the Fund. I rather gathered that from what the right hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>437</span>
I do not want to press him at all upon that point at the present moment, but in support of the view that that should be done, so far as the extractors are concerned, I am sure that he will have regard to the weight of the argument both with regard to rating and with regard to possible alterations of Schedule A assessments, so far as they effect particular operators. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not think I am delaying matters—I am not intending to do so—by raising these points now, and expressing my thanks to him for the attitude which he has adopted towards these further suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we argue that the extractors may have the benefit of the rating rebate, we do so to point out that some further consideration should be given to the landowner, and not to draw attention to the idea of putting a further charge upon extractors. When I first became articled as a surveyor, some of the first jobs which were put on to me were to appear before the rating tribunals to appeal against the rate assessments of properties of some of our clients. The easy line that the young surveyor takes is to find a similar property with a lower assessment and then appear in front of the tribunal and say, "Because the assessment of this property is lower than that of the property of my client, then my client's assessment should be reduced." Never was that reduction granted. In each case, the assessment of the unfortunate owner whose property I used for comparison was raised to the same level as that of my client.

When we ask for greater fairness to the landowner it should not be at the expense of the extractors. There is no need for it. I am certain that the cost of restoration will allow for the rebates that the right hon. Gentleman can give.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 16, after "land," to insert:

The subsection to which I move this Amendment lays down the operations in respect of which, subject to certain conditions, payments may be made to operators out of the ironstone Fund. It specifies all such operations. The first is the levelling of worked ironstone land and the second is the respreading of surface soil. My Amendment seeks to add a third operation in respect of which payments might be made to operators—namely, measures other than the respreading of surface soil for restoring fertility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During earlier stages of the consideration of fills Bill, the possibility has been referred to by many hon. Members that where it is difficult or impracticable to retain the surface soil and to respread it,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1950-1951V000P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>439</span>
there may be at present, or there may be devised in future, methods by which surface soil might be, as it were, created from the levelled underlayers which are left after the ironstone has been extracted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it from a person like myself—a townee representing an industrial constituency—to take part in the arguments which have taken place between my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. Nugent) and some of my other hon. Friends on the question of whether it is possible to recreate humus in this way. But I do not think that we ought to let the Bill leave the Committee in such a form that if that possibility exists now, or should be devised in the future, it would be impossible to make payments out of the Fund in respect of that sort of restoration. In order to cover all possible methods of treating the soil so as to restore fertility, I suggest that these words should be added to the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will be able to accept this Amendment. I would remind him that on the last occasion the Committee met he referred to the encouraging results of some experiments. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where there is no top soil at all it may be possible first of all, to have pasture, and, perhaps after that, to grow crops upon it. They are hopeful about it. I think we ought to encourage them to experiment."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee</i> A. 1st May, 1951; c. 29.]</p></blockquote>
Then his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary reminded him that in one place where an experiment had worked satisfactorily this remarkable rejuvenation and regeneration of the soil had been brought about in the space of two years. Therefore, I hope that the scope will be widened to enable payments to be made to encourage this kind of experimental work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While not dissenting from the actual words of the Amendment, I should be sorry if the impression went out from this Committee that there is any real likelihood of success in the process of the artificial creation of top soil. There is no doubt at all that in these restorations the key to the whole future is the preservation of the top soil at the time when it is put back again. The words of the Amendment in no way weaken that, and as long as it is on the record that it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
was in the mind of the Committee that what we really want is to preserve the top soil and put it back again, I feel there would be no danger in accepting the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to impress on the right hon. Gentleman, if that is necessary, that in almost every case where work has been done to try to recreate agricultural land where the top soil has been lost—and hundreds of sites can be found, particularly in opencast coal workings—a sward is established which stays for the first and second years, but in the third year it goes backward and by the fourth it has gone. That land is not agricultural land and it probably will not be for hundreds of years. So long as it is clear that what we really want is what the Clause says—the levelling of the land and the restoration of the top soil—I am agreeable to the Amendment being accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Winterbottom</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it might be appropriate to mention one point. I agree with the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Nugent). I have made some first hand study of this problem of the restoration of top soil in the brown coal mines of Germany where for some years there has been a statutory obligation to restore the land. The technique has developed so that the whole care is for the restoration of the top soil. That can only be achieved by experiments in the techniques of mining. It is clear from subsection (3) of this Clause that there is considerable variation in technique.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we could improve our technique of mining we should be able to restore the top soil from the commencement of operations. For this reason, study and research into techniques are desirable. The Minister has already accepted in principle research into agricultural methods. I consider that research into engineering methods is equally desirable. Perhaps it is not the Minister's duty. It may be the duty of his colleague the Minister of Supply to undertake this type of research. I should be glad if the Minister would indicate whether in principle he is in favour of engineering research, and that he will promote it himself or stimulate his colleague to undertake it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. M. Philips Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene because I think I might be able to contribute an idea. During the war I was a member

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>441</span>
of the Select Committee on National Expenditure, which went to various parts of the country to investigate the extraction of coal from near the surface by quarrying methods. The question was whether by use of American machinery this could be done more cheaply. I remember seeing the methods adopted by those who were then operating in South Wales and parts of Yorkshire. Big excavators took away the surface soil and put it in a heap separate from the rest, probably in the same way that the work is done in Germany. The subsoil was also put in a separate heap, as was the native rock. Then the coal was extracted. After that the materials were put back in the same way—first the rock, then the subsoil and then the top soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a considerable disturbance and destruction of bacteria which make plant growth possible, but there is no doubt that, within a much shorter time than had been experienced hitherto, crops could grow again. We saw in Yorkshire a site where, after two years, crops were growing again. If these methods are adopted the damage can be reduced, though there is still damage. Whatever is done, I hope that steps will be taken to make that method of exploitation more possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had some most interesting contributions on this matter. I have said all the time, and the development order which I made last year has expressly affirmed, that wherever possible we want the top soil respread. I do not think there is any doubt that that is by far the best method, and, indeed, the only sure way of restoring the land to full agricultural potency. On the other hand, there are cases where that has not been done in the past, due to the neglect of the excavators and the failure of owners to make the necessary provision in the leases. There are also some cases where it is most expensive to do this work. That has all been discussed before, but it is useful to recapitulate it. In some cases it has been rendered impossible by failure to do the right thing; in other cases it is extremely expensive to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the purposes of this Bill is to set up a Fund out of which cases where it would be too expensive to do the work without a subsidy can be helped. That is the underlying thought. I am prepared to accept the Amendment. In effect it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>442</span>
not much more than a drafting Amendment to make clear that in cases where other methods for restoring fertility are applied they shall be covered by this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most anxious to encourage in every way I can research into this subject. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, Central (Mr. Ian Winterbottom) for mentioning his experience. As to where the responsibility would fall, I will investigate that question. I am not sure that the Ministry of Supply would be the appropriate Department. Conceivably it might be done by the D.S.I.R. or some such body as that. I have taken note of the point. It is an important one, and I will look into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Philips Price) has also given some interesting examples of what can be done, and I am much obliged to him. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Nugent) is pessimistic about some of these experiments. I am not an expert on these matters. I merely listen to experts. I do not share the hon. Gentleman's pessimism, but I repeat that it is far better to get the top soil back again if we can. Perhaps after these general observations and this useful discussion, if I accept the Amendment we might get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>443</span>
This Amendment is half way between being a drafting Amendment and being an Amendment of substance. The general purpose of the Bill is that all operators who work ironstone in this area by opencast operations shall contribute to the Fund. On an earlier Amendment, some hon. Members on this side of the Committee drew attention to the inequity, as it appeared to us, that while all opencast operators should contribute to the Fund, only those whose over-burden exceeded 35 ft. would, in the normal circumstances, be able to derive any payment from the Fund. We have now come to the Clause in which the basis of that payment is stated, and it appears to me that the whole principle is really provided in subsection (2) of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may read only the operative words, they are as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) the payment to be made to an operator…shall be at such rate per acre as may…represent the amount by which the cost…exceeds the average rate."</p></blockquote>
That average rate is defined as being the average rate of restoring an over-burden of 35 ft. It seems to me that subsection (2) states with a complete economy of words—I have only omitted the explanatory words in between—the general purpose of this Bill. As I see it, what will happen if subsection (2) stands alone will be this. If it be the case that the cost of restoring land is higher when the overburden is more than 35 ft., then the payment made to each operator would be the amount by which the cost of restoring the land exceeds the average cost of restoring an over-burden of 35 ft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly speaking, that is the purpose of this Bill. Subsection (4) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No payment shall be made to an operator under this section in respect of work carried out on any land unless the Minister is satisfied that the over-burden exceeds thirty-five feet in depth over at least nine-tenths of the land, or that by reason of special circumstances the cost per acre which the operator, working as mentioned in subsection (2) of this section, would incur in carrying out the work substantially exceeds the average rate."</p></blockquote>
I cannot see that subsection (4) does anything more than elaborate the general provisions of subsection (2). What it does, in fact, is to rub in, if I may use those words, the fact that operators with an over-burden of less than 35 ft. are to make the same contribution to the Fund,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
but are not to derive any benefit from it, but there is still the proviso that, where it can be shown that there are special circumstances which make the cost of restoration particularly high, even in the case of an over-burden of less than 35 ft., a contribution may be paid because of the special circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that we should arrive at almost exactly the same result in a simpler way if subsection (4) was left out and subsection (2) was left to operate. It would be fairer and more equitable,if this basic idea of the average cost of restoring an over-burden of 35 ft. were taken as being the only criterion, and, wherever the cost does exceed that, a contribution should be paid, and that, where it is only the average cost or less than the average cost, no payment should be made out of the Fund. I think that, therefore, because the purpose of any Bill should be stated as simply as possible in order that it should work as flexibly and equitably as possible, there is a strong case to be made out for leaving out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other important point which I would like to put forward, although I know that the Minister will say that he is not convinced by any of the figures that have been given. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Fylde (Colonel Lancaster) has very great experience of restoring land after iron ore operations, and he says that it makes extraordinarily little difference to the cost of restoration what the depth of the over-burden is. He says that it makes a difference to the cost of obtaining the iron ore, but very little difference to the cost of restoration, and that what really counts for far more is the nature of the over-burden which has to be restored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as I personally believe, he is right in that, it seems to me that, for that reason also, subsection (2) should be left to operate without being explained by subsection (4). I do not believe that this will make any appreciable difference to the contributions which will be received by the different operators, but I believe that it will be simpler to understand and will be rather more equitable in its operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a later Amendment on the Order Paper in my name which will have the effect of deleting this

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>445</span>
subsection, and I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has noticed it. Therefore, if my Amendment is accepted later on, the effect will be almost the same. The actual form of the present Amendment does away with the whole subsection, whereas it would be convenient to retain the initial words, which are not the substance of the matter. Therefore, I suggest that this Amendment might now be withdrawn, because we may consider the matter again in the light of the Amendment which I shall submit to the Committee later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is right, and I have no doubt that the other Amendment can easily be passed. I would point out to the Committee, if any evidence were needed of the fact, that we take as much interest in trying to secure equity for excavators as for landowners, and I would establish the inaccuracy of the Minister's remarks in trying to make it appear that we were only concerned with one particular interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to apologise for not having read the Minister's Amendment.
