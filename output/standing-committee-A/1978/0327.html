	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Overseas Development (Mr. John Tomlinson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 31, line 26, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"14. Negotiating and making contracts for the assembly, installation, commissioning of maintenance of equipment.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we arc to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 5, in clause 5, page 5, line 10, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ll) subject to subsection (3), assembling, installing, commissioning or maintaining any equipment procured and sold in pursuance of paragraph (l);".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 7, in clause 5, page 5, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>aa</i>) the power under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) to provide any of the services mentioned in subsection (2)(	<i>ll</i>);".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 35 is largely self-explanatory. As drafted, the Bill empowers the Crown Agents to procure property as agents on behalf of their principlas. The effect of this amendment would be to allow the Crown Agents to place contracts on behalf of their principals for the assembly, installation, commissioning and maintenance of equipment. In most cases these services will relate to equipment that the Crown Agents have procured, but since this is an agency service there is no reason to restrict it in this way, and the amendment will leave the Crown Agents free to place contracts for such services on behalf of principals for equipment which they themselves have not procured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are services which the Crown Agents already offer as agents and we think they should continue to do so. Not to be able to offer these services would seriously reduce the Crown Agents' effectiveness as a procurement agency whenever
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
installations or maintenance were factors influencing procurement. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 5 and 7 concern the same services, although their extent is slightly different. They authorise the Crown Agents to assemble, instal, corn-mission and maintain equipment procured in their own right under Clause 5(2)(	<i>l</i>), subject to ministerial consent. From the point of view of the principal, the installation or commissioning of a piece of equipment may often count as an integral part of its procurement, and it therefore seems right to make it possible for the Crown Agents to offer these services as part of their own procurement function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendent agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 31, line 26, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"14. Subcontracting to perform any of the activities within paragraphs 1–12".</p></blockquote>
I understand that we are to take at the same time amendment No. 4, in clause 5, page 4, line 25, after "right", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"either directly, or by subcontract".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of both these amendments is identical, that is, to probe the extent to which the Government envisage permitting the Crown Agents to sub-contract to private bodies, if necessary, a certain range of their activities. In recent years the Crown Agents have from time to time sub-contracted some of their services where they have found it more cost-effective or beneficial to do so. I do not think that there would be disagreement that in certain areas of authorised agency activities it would be more cost-effective and efficient for the Crown Agents deliberately to sub-contract certain of their activities to private enterprise. It would enable them to provide a more efficient service and would save costs. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us whether that is the case and in what areas there has been sub-contracting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take as an example, under the authorised agency activities, paragraph 3:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Obtaining professional advice on projects and negotiating and making contracts for the preparation of projects and the carrying out of feasibility studies."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
One can here envisage a wide range of private organisations which would be well equipped to supplement the work of the Crown Agents and one would like to be able to call upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, under paragraph 4—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Acquiring and disposing of land"</p></blockquote>
and paragraph 8—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Making travel and other arrangements for staff"</p></blockquote>
it could be more efficient to sub-contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7—here I declare an interest —covers "Recruiting staff". Again, I should have thought that the Crown Agents—this is an area in which they are increasingly involved, and in which they have been involved for a long time—could derive benefit from sub-contracting their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what extent does the Minister envisage the Crown Agents undertaking this kind of activity? Would there not be an advantage, if he does envisage this kind of activity, in making clear in the Bill that they are entitled to do that, and indeed encouraged to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham (Mr. Luce) and, in particular, to draw the Minister's attention to the possibility that the Crown Agents may in the future be called upon to provide marketing services for their principals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the developing countries move into industry and become more capable of packaging some of their primary products, they will need marketing advice if they are to penetrate the countries of Western Europe. Although assistance is available to them at the moment through the United Kingdom Trade and Development Authority—which used to be called the DCIOO —it is likely that they will need to go outside the resources of the Crown Agents to get specific marketing advice. I declare an interest here, as a marketing consultant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Agents, in my view, can provide a useful service to principals in encouraging them to market their goods and services efficiently not only in the United Kingdom but throughout Europe:. I believe that the Bill should make clear that they are free to seek private sector support and consultancy to aid them in this purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add a few words of caution on this matter. I can see the sense of the Crown Agents, having been asked to undertake a function which is in their powers as defined but on which hitherto they have not built up a great deal of expertise, seeking the advice of those who have built up expertise. There is good sense and prudence in so doing. But if this particular service which the Crown Agents may be in a good position to provide—particularly if it is associated with another service with the same clients, or, indeed, if the specialised service is related to a much bigger generalised service which is already being provided—is associated with subcontractors or consultants, it might inhibit or at least slow down the ability or willingness of the Crown Agents to extend their activities into that field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second hesitation that I have on this matter is that the Crown Agents, by virtue of their activity, are dealing with large sums and with a wide range of clientele, some of whom have very broad requirements. I have no doubt that the Minister will tell us to what extent, if at all, the Crown Agents now have that power. I ought to know that but I do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the power is extended, or confirmed if it exists, the ability, contacts and experience that a sub-contractor or consultant may thereby find beneficial in the Crown Agents' activities will, I suspect, be greater than with many other principal bodies and will therefore be potentially to the advantage—I shall not say to underbid, but be of advantage—to the sub-contractor. He might even be persuaded to do the work at cost, or a little under cost, in order to plug into this pipeline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, therefore, the Minister is considering adding to the powers or confirming those that already exist, there ought to be an indication—not necessarily in the Bill, but at least from the Minister—of the safeguards that he would think it prudent and right for the Crown Agents to insert at that point. The possibilities arising from this are not to be excluded. I foresee prices for a one-off service that might be appropriate. However, I can also see great dangers, and I hope that the Committee can also see them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) have put the issue very much into perspective. This is not just a question of black and white—whether we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
want to do it inside the Crown Agents or whether it should be entirely subcontracted. There will be matters of balance and judgment, depending on precisely what function has to be performed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my main point is that the amendment is not necessary. Under clause 6 the Crown Agents already have, with certain exceptions which do not affect subcontracting, ancillary powers
	<br><blockquote><p>"to do … anything which is calculated to facilitate the carrying on of the activities … or is incidental or conducive to the carrying on of … those activities".</p></blockquote>
It seems unlikely that the Crown Agents would in practice wish to sub-contract their agency functions as such, except perhaps in exceptional circumstances and in so far as the authority from their principals allowed them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, from some of the activities detailed in Schedule 4—for example those in paragraphs 3 and 4—it will be seen that the Crown Agents will be able to procure the services of private sector companies for their principals. That will depend partly on the precise relationship that they have with their principals. The Crown Agents will judge such matters on commercial criteria and on the interests of their principals, and will then make the decision to sub-contract where they have not the capacity to deal with the matter themselves. I suggest, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may answer the point made by the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). The purpose of the amendment was not to impose an obligation on the Crown Agents to sub-contract but to make clear that they were permitted to do so. The purpose was to probe that and to see whether the Crown Agents had that ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has answered the question, and, in view of what he has said, I shall not seek a vote of confidence on the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister for elucidation here? I think that I know the meaning but in the circumstances I think that some comments may be helpful. Subsection (4) provides that where the Crown Agents are acting for a scheduled authority or body and receive sums of money for investment on behalf of the principal
	<br><blockquote><p>"they shall have power in their own right, pending the disbursement or investment of that sum on behalf of the principal, to make use of it for their own benefit by investing it in their own name in accordance with regulations".</p></blockquote>
I take it—I am sure that the Minister will be able to confirm and amplify—that while the Crown Agents are looking for an appropriate home for the moneys entrusted to them, those moneys can go into their own account for their own activities. The activities, of course, are entirely within the regulations, as the subsection says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, those moneys can amount to a substantial sum. I assume that, although the amount is there for only a relatively short period—perhaps two or three months—cumulatively it could be quite a lot of money that was available for investment by the Crown Agents. I understand that that is, as it were, the floating account and will be closely controlled by the regulations, but I hope that my right hon. Friend will remind us of those regulations and tell us how substantial the sums are likely to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Overseas Development (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 think that I can reassure my hon. Friend. What he says is quite correct. Where the Crown Agents carry on activities in their own right in terms of the services specified in clause 5, it would be a limited amount of money. They are agents acting on behalf of their principals and as such, in their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
own right, they must be able to do certain things on behalf of those principals. It is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure my hon. Friend that there is no need for any anxiety that there would be any undue expenditure. It would be only the amount of money necessary for the Crown Agents to be able to carry out their services for their principals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister—not immediately now but when we come to clause 8, because there is a relationship between clause 5 and clause 8 —to tell us what is the relationship between subsection (4) of clause 5 and subsection (3) of clause 8? They appear to say virtually the same but with a different order of words, though using very much the same words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(4) says that where the Crown Agents are acting as agents and get some money as agents, before they do with that money the thing they are supposed to do as agents they are allowed in their own right and in their own name to do something else with it. Clause 8(3) looks to me as though it says the same thing. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that matter when we come to clause 8, since the matter clearly arises on both clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard orthodoxy is that nobody, certainly not a Member of Parliament—and some would say, no Minister either—should make any comment about the drafting of statutes, because that is always left to the experts. But there are some characteristics of the drafting of this Bill which I regard as decidedly curious—in fact, downright wrong and silly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 5(4) there is a reference to the regulations which the Minister is to make. The regulations are referred to in that subsection. They are referred to again, as I said, in clause 8(3). To some extent they arc covered in clause 30(1). Then we come to clause 31(1), the glossary or interpretation clause. It is arguable that they ought to be covered in clause 31(4), which says that if the Minister gives an order the person to whom she gives it must obey it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a messy way to construct a statute, and there is something to which I take great exception. In subsection (4) we have the word "regulations". It occurs also in clause 8(3). To find out what regulations are, we have to turn to the interpretation clause, clause 31, where regulations are defined as
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"regulations made by the Minister with the approval of the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
I know that that is a definition of the word, but it is not the kind of definition which belongs in the interpretation clause. That clause should be used for definitional purposes. It should not be used as the location for laying down the manner by which subordinate legislation is made, but that is what has been done here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we arc providing for the subordinate legislation in clause 30 and saying various things about how orders are to be made and so on, the manner by which regulations are to be made is not defined in clause 30. It comes in the interpretation clause. That is not right. It is not normal and it is untidy. It should be done in the clause that covers subordinate legislation, and normally it is. One does not normally say in an interpretation clause "When we refer in this Act to art order, we mean an order laid subject to affirmative resolution" and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the definition of regulations which appears in the glossary clause 31 ought to be taken out and built into clause 30 where it belongs. I hope that that can be tidied up. It is purely a drafting matter, but the drafting is getting worse and it is high time that Members and Ministers took more interest in it than they have done in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make three points: first, the relationship between clause 5(4) and clause 8(3); and second, the definition of regulations. Third—I am sure you will stop me if I am out of order, Mrs. Butler, but I think it does relate to this package—there is in clause 31(4) a statement that, when the Minister gives directions or instructions, that is to be construed as enforcing a duty to obey them upon those whom she directs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not say that the same applies to regulations. I suspect that that is all right because the manner in which the provisions dealing with regulations are drafted does the job. I think that clause 5(4) and clause 8(3) make clear that regulations are not just something that the Minister can issue but that the Crown Agents arc to obey them. If that is the explanation, I am satisfied, but I should like to know whether that is the explanation of why regulations are not included in the provisions of clause 31(4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely take the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for

	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham). I shall look at this drafting matter with parliamentary counsel. There are one or two small things that I have promised to look at before the Bill goes through its final stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend appreciates that it is not only officials who should give attention to the drafting of Bills. May I say that I understand that never in 30 years has the drafting of a Bill been so subject to ministerial amendment as has this one. But I am afraid that I took it virtually for granted that clause 31 was all right, and I am sorry if we need to make a slight drafting change to that clause. I assure my hon. Friend, however, that on this occasion deep attention was given to some of the precise drafting, for the convenience of the Committee which would deal with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to leave most of the points to be tidied up after the Committee stage, but I wonder whether, when we come to clause 8, the Minister will deal with the first point I made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed; my right hon. Friend will take up that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 7, line 43, after "profit", insert "or loss".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be a wise amendment to any statute. Profit is no more likely than loss, particularly in our experience in investment matters. As has been said, this clause allows the Crown Agents to receive money ahead of the need to spend or invest it, and to invest it in their own names and on their own responsibility until it is ultimately required for paying out. If they do so they will have to pay interest to the principal under subsection (4), but if they make a profit from using the investment they will not have to
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
account for it. It is essential that we should add the point if they make a loss they must not debit the principal with that loss, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be said that this is merely a drafting amendment, but since, so far as we can make out, the right hon. Lady has personally drafted the Bill, I hope that she will not feel insulted if I suggest that she ought to include these words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is, indeed, more understandable than most Bills. Since we now know the identity of the draftswomen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to intervene. I would not claim—I do not think that anyone on the Committee would claim—to have any expertise in the art of drafting Bills, but there can be moments when Ministers can draw attention to slight additions, deletions or changes in wording which would be to the convenience of the Members of the House who have to consider the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In clause 8 the wretched regulations crop up again. When I put down amendments about the regulations only on clause 15 I was not doing my work properly. Although what I have to say then will apply to the regulations in this clause, it might be more sensible—if the hon.

Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should say at the outset that I have never drafted a single word of any Finance Bill on which I have sat, and neither, I believe, has any other Treasury Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with amendment No. 8, and I quite see why hon. Members put it down. This issue has taken me hours of consultation with Government lawyers, who in the end have convinced me that the amendment is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By general law—by common law, if that is the right expression—the loss would in any case fall upon the Crown Agents. That is because of the fiduciary relationship between the agent in this case and the principal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection alters the general law of principal and agent in relation to profit. It embodies what has always been the position between principal and agent both fen. the Crown Agents and for other cases where the profit accrues to the agent. The clause merely reflects that position and the usage and custom that have grown up. It is not peculiar to this situation. There are other areas where it is so. There is a similar provision, for instance, in the Solicitors Act. It is a matter of practicality. This is short-term money. It is difficult to earmark it and trace it. Often the money is mixed together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I can give the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) the reassurance he needs, that any loss will fall on the Crown Agents. It is not necessary, therefore, to include that provision. The loss falls according to the law, and there is no intention to change the law. The clause does the right thing. The Crown Agents get the profit and they suffer the loss as a result of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I believe that the amendment is not necessary, but I quite understand the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One achievement, at least, of the amendment is that it has taken hours of the Minister of State's time which would have been much worse spent had he been considering the Finance Bill.

amendment No. 9, in page 8, line 16, at end insert —
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Bank of England or—".</p></blockquote>
The reason for the amendment, which is really a drafting amendment, is that "bank" is defined, for the purposes of the clause, in accordance with the Exchange Control Act 1947 or—if and when the Banking Bill that is now going through the other House becomes law—in accordance with the Banking Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately for the Bank of England, it is neither a bank for the purposes of the Exchange Control Act nor a bank for the purposes of the Banking Bill. For various reasons, it is not necessary to include it in either of those pieces of legislation. On the other hand, it is the Crown Agents' main banker. It would be rather perverse if the Crown Agents could not deposit money with their main banker. The amendment remedies that gap in the legislation to enable the Crown Agents to deposit their money with the Bank of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is a perfectly reasonable amendment. The only question that I have to ask—not being very familiar with the Banking Bill—is whether the two classes of bank would both be acceptable banks to receive the Crown Agents' deposits. Clearly, the Bank of England is acceptable, and so are the main banks. But can the "goats", as it were, in the Banking Bill accept money from the Crown Agents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another small point in this context. I suppose that it is in order to refer to the "Banking Act 1979", but, as far as I know, no such Act exists. There is a Banking Bill, but it has not yet received the Royal Assent. I accept that this wording may be necessary, but we could get into a mess if this Bill received the Royal Assent and the Banking Bill fell before the dissolution of Parliament. That could be a tricky situation. It is probably slightly bad practice, but that is by the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, under this legislation the banks in which the Crown Agents deposit their money are banks which are authorised under the Exchange Control Act 1947. Let me say that they are mostly not "goats". The Bank of England makes sure that they are responsible banks. if the Banking Bill becomes law, they will be recognised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
banks. The licensed deposit-taking sector would not be brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The banks under the Exchange Control Act and the recognised banks under the Banking Bill may not necessarily be completely identical, but in practice I do not believe that there will be many differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Gentleman's point about "the Banking Act". If the Banking Bill does not go through all its stages, presumably we should need to change the wording here to reflect that fact. Then the only requirement would be the Exchange Control Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to prolong this debate, but may I just flag a point for the Minister? The Banking Bill defines banks very closely and does so not to include the subsidiary or associated offices of banks registered in other countries. Such banks may be large and substantial banks in their own countries which run a comparatively small operation in the United Kingdom. Those banking institutions will not be entitled to use the word "bank" or, if the Banking Bill goes through as now worded, will need to qualify the use of the word "bank" in their title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An overseas institution with which the Crown Agents are dealing may wish for its own good purposes to see moneys deposited with a banking institution which is particularly connected with the overseas country, yet that overseas banking institution may not have the status of bank. I am making a point of detail. It depends, of course, on the way in which the Banking Bill eventually goes through. However, in my view it is worth flagging the point at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. We have already discussed the Banking Bill. Let me remind Opposition Members that it was, of course, a Conservative amendment in Committee which created this problem, if there is a problem. However, we are aware of the general point. The Banking Bill is now in the House of Lords, as I said, and the particular issue has not yet been resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have passed rather rapidly to clause 8, and thought that we were to have an explanation of the relationship between clause 5(4) and clause 8(3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal with that point now. Clause 8 deals with the moneys which the Crown Agents will receive pending the placing of orders and pending carrying out their activities. The moneys really represent short-term money as part of their pre-funding exercise. The Bill lays upon the Crown Agents the obligation for pre-funding their activities. That money may be needed or held by them for only a fairly short time, and clause 8(3)—and, indeed, clause 5—provide, in accordance with the regulations, how that money is to be invested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations under later clauses deal with different kinds of motley. It may be that both sets of regulations will not differ greatly, but here we are concerned with short-term money which may be held for only a couple of weeks. They may be large sums of money but held for only a couple of weeks, and the regulations will provide where that money is to be put, in the interests of everybody, for prudential reasons. That, of course, will be subject to agreement between the Crown Agents and the Minister, with the approval of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(4) says what is to be done in relation to that money, and clause 8(3) specifically sets out that the money must be invested "in accordance with regulations". I hope that that satisfies my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it does. Clause 5(4) and Clause 8(3) say precisely the same thing but in different words—indeed, very often using the same words but in different order. Let me take the guts of the two clauses, leaving out the filling. Clause 5(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where … they shall have power in their own right … to make use of it for their own benefit by investing it in their own name …".</p></blockquote>
Clause 8(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any sum … may … be invested by the Crown Agents in their own name and for their own benefit …".</p></blockquote>
Precisely the same circumstances are referred to. So if the Crown Agents turn to the law for advice on what they can do with money which they receive as agents but which is not immediately required, 
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
they will find the law contained in clause 5(4) and clause 8(3), which are differently worded but which mean precisely the same. I do not think that there is any substantive difference. That is the nature of my complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the following subsections of clause 8 contain material entirely additional to that contained in clause 5. But, surely, clause 8(4) should no refer back to the repetitive clause 8(3) but should refer back to clause 5(4), and clause 8(3) should be exdluded. It gets a little involved, does it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to leave that point for consideration by Ministers, but on the face of it there is a duplication in those two subsections. They have been badly drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I shall look at the point raised by my hon. Friend. As I understand it, clause 5(4) is the vires, the power to use such money, and clause 8(3) requires that power to be used in accordance with the regulations laid down. But I take the point made by my hon. Friend, and I shall certainly look at it to see whether we can improve the drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with that at the moment, but they both say that it must be done in accordance with regulations. Strictly speaking, no regulations can be made under clause 8(3). The regulations under clause 8(3) must be made under clause 5(4). There must be duplication, but we can deal with it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to probe the question of the Minister's objectives in clause 9. In terms of ministerial inter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
vention she will recall only too well, in view of her late experience with the Crown Agents, the Stevenson committee report published in 1974. In that report the recommendation, broadly speaking, was that the degree of ministerial intervention in the powers of Crown Agents should be minimised. Since then, a great deal of water has flowed under the bridge. There should be a distinction drawn between the own account activities—the realisation board—on the one hand, and the Crown Agents, on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first reflection on clause 9 is that the Minister is asking for powers of considerable intervention with regard to the efficiency and management of the Crown Agents. I am not necessarily saying that that is wrong, but I should like to know what the Minister has in mind here in trying to reconcile that with paragraph 4 of the explanatory memorandum, which highlights the important point that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The powers of financial control over Crown Agents given to the Minister by the Bill do not extend to allow intervention in the Crown Agents' commercial relations with their oversea and other principals".</p></blockquote>
It is important that, once the structure of the Crown Agents has been agreed upon and competent people—as now have—have been appointed, they should be allowed to get on with their task with the minimal amount of intervention. If we can have an explanation from the Minister as to what she has in mind here, it will help considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to give the hon. Member for Shoreham (Mr. Luce) an explanation. I do not think that he need be worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, with the history of Crown Agents behind us, clause 9 is necessary. What is vital in the clause is the provision in subsection (2) that reports will be laid before each House of Parliament. In the past, as we know, there has not been adequate opportunity for this or the other House to review what was happening. I regard that as crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 is a standard provision. It is a standard provision in the Gas Act 1972, for example. It provides for a management review—an overall review. There is no incliniation on my part—and I do not think there would be for any Minister—to relate this to day-to-day affairs. It provides for an overall management review, 
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
as is the case with every department of the Civil Service. Every Ministry has its own management review from time to time. It is to cover that kind of point. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no intention of exercising any sharp intervention in the day-to-day affairs of the Crown Agents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just two points to raise on this clause. The first follows what the Minister has said about parliamentary safeguards. This is a very wide-ranging power and I make no complaint about that. But the directions which have to be made under regulation, and which must be obeyed, can only follow after a report has been laid before Parliament, as the Minister pointed out when she referred to subsection (2). That is only a safeguard in the sense that although the Minister has powers at any time, there will not be too often—or necessarily at all—a pulling-up of the roots to see how they are growing. It is a matter of balance here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, can the Minister say—I think it important to put it on record at this time—what precisely laying a report before each House of Parliament entails? I take it that it is a deposit of a White Paper by command which lies on the Table of the House, which can be seen and perused and about which an hon. Member can ask a question, or put down a motion by Early-Day Motion or in Private Members' time, or the Opposition could table a motion on Supply. But I understand that that is not necessary and, so long as it is laid for some period of time, the Minister can go ahead and make such directions as he considers appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is right and proper that it should be made public by being laid on the Table, it does not necessarily need anything more. That may be all that is required. Can my right hon. Friend confirm that that is the position and whether it would be in the form of a White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I refer to clause 1. Here I make some apology. The Bill got off to such a cracking start, and we got clause 1 off the ground so quickly that I did not catch your eye in time, Mrs. Butler—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not returning to clause 1. He would be completely out of order if he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mrs. Butler, but it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
a point raised by clause 1 and by the words "review of the affairs". Clause 1 refers to a change of name, and if it is in order, when the Minister talks about a review of the affairs of the Crown Agents, it may save time later if we know whether such a review would include the change of name and under what criteria that might be undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quarrel for a moment with what the Minister said about the need for accountability to Parliament. That is one of the main objectives, with which we entirely concur. However, I want to be absolutely clear about the degree of intervention in overall management activities because, although the Minister says that this is in line with the objectives and laws in relation to other public sector bodies, she said on Second Reading—quite rightly, in my view—that this is a public sector body with a difference. It is a unique body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not quite answer my point about leaving to the Crown Agents as much autonomy as possible in their relations with their principals. That is an important point. I want to be clear, now that the broad structure is being established, that there should be minimal intervention by the Minister in overall management activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take that point first. I can give a complete assurance that no intention whatever is implied by clause 9 that there will be any ministerial intervention in the day-to-day running of affairs between the Crown Agents and their principals. We are all completely agreed that that would be most unsound and most unwelcome to everybody concerned—the Minister, the Crown Agents and the principals. I can give the hon. Gentleman that complete assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). In the past, the Crown Agents themselves have issued an annual report. That report has not been made to Parliament. In past years it has sometimes been a little out of date. It has sometimes not necessarily contained the information that Members of the House would want. There is therefore now a requirement for a report to be made to the Minister and then to be laid before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I can be fairly categorical about this matter. I shall make an analogy which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
my hon. Friend may understand. The new town development corporations submit annual reports either to the Secretary of State for Scotland or to the Secretary of State for the Environment. Those reports take the form of Blue Books which are laid before Parliament. I envisage that this report will take the same form. It will not be a White Paper, I think, because a White Paper is normally a statement of Government policy. There will be an annual report in the form of a Blue Book laid before Parliament with which Parliament can do whatever it wishes. If Parliament wishes to debate it—from time to time it has debated such annual reports—it may do so. If Parliament does not wish to debate it, it need not do so. The report will be available to hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my right hon. Friend is saying that the report will be a Command Paper, but not necessarily a White Paper. But is she not mixing up two things? She has talked about an annual report, but the report referred to in clause 9 arises only out of a review of the Crown Agents' affairs. As we are dealing with this matter, could my right hon. Friend also deal with the status of the annual report? It may be given in the Bill but, if so, I am afraid I have forgotten it. Is it, like the reports of other publicly-owned or publicly-associated institutions, to be laid on the Table; is it only for the Minister; or will it go, in general, to nobody, as happened previously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 9(2) deals with the report following a review. Both that report and the annual report would take the form that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 11, line 3, leave out "period" and insert "year or years".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 deals with the financial
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
performance expected of the Crown Agents. I am quite keen that we should give financial targets to trading corporations in the public sector and that those financial targets should be adhered to, unless there are good reasons to the contrary. That discipline should be brought into the whole of the nationalised industries in a more convincing way than at present, not in a higgledy-piggledy way. Some nationalised industries have had targets of so much percentage on turnover and so much on capital employed while others have just had to break even, taking one year with another. The targets should reflect the cost of the funds being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Agents should be no exception. If they receive funds from the taxpayer—a point that I shall question later—they should make a rate of return roughly in line with the cost of the money they have borrowed. The Government are right to include that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me, however, is that it is a rate of return for "any period". "Any period" could be a day or 100 years. I do not think that rates of return should be varied frequently. The suggestion of a yearly variation should be the minimum acceptable period. Indeed, I should prefer targets to be set for longer periods. It would be easier for the management, it would be less confusing, and there would be less opportunity to move profits from one year to another in order to comply with the required rate of return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was tempted to repalce "any period" with "any period of two or three years." But, in order to move slowly in that direction, I suggest that we should substitute "year or years", because "period" could be interpreted as all too short a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the intention of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) in exploring this matter. I am sure he will appreciate that his amendment would cause a loss of flexibility, which I am sure he would not wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, especially with you in the Chair, Mrs. Butler, that at some time the House should consider that Ministers in Bills are always "he".
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may determine … the overall rate of return which he considers … appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Somehow we must find a new bisexual word. I do not enjoy the way all Ministers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
are "he" or "him". However, that is not a point that would concern the hon. Gentleman, although perhaps I may malign him. In practice, it is the Government's intention to set an overall rate of return for specific periods—12 months or perhaps a little longer—to coincide with the period of the accounting year for which audited figures will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly it would not be possible to fine tune the management of the Crown Agents' business to meet, say, monthly or quarterly targets. But any attempt to specify in advance the precise period for which the target should be set would reduce flexibility and lead to difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if it were decided to change the accounting year, the 12-month period would be different. One might want to set a target to coincide with either an extended or a shortened accounting year. But it is certainly the intention that there should be a fairly precise, not too long-term, basis on which to set the targets. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman about that aspect. Indeed, that will be known to Parliament. Whatever the Minister determines will be a matter of which Parliament becomes aware.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 12, in page 12, line 13, leave out "in accordance with regulations".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, I wish to probe a little into the regulations that appear throughout the Bill. Perhaps this is an inappropriate clause to seek to amend, but my argument applies here as in other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not quite know what the regulations will contain. They will not be laid before Parliament for approval. Regulations can be issued without any further parliamentary sanction, and I am suspicious as to what they may provide. Most public bodies having funds which from time to time shall be invested by them are severely restricted in the investments that they may make. It is only recently that trustees have been allowed to invest half of their funds in equities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of this sort of restriction— which perhaps dates from Victorian times— has been that, at one time, it was perfectly all right to invest in war loan, but not in equities. War loan fell to one-tenth of its former value and equities struggled manfully to try to keep up. Restrictions, which tend to get out of date and are not revised, may not be as great a safeguard as we think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that, by saying that money should be invested only in accordance with regulations, we imagine that we have solved the problem of making bad investments. But we have not solved the problem of making bad regulations. We are not even to be shown the regulations. What will these regulations include?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to refer to amendment No. 43, standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Northwest (Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler), other than to say that one's attitude to that amendment depends on what one thinks of the regulations. If one believes that regulations are a guarantee of good investment, one should certainly support his amendment. If, like me, one wonders whether regulations sometimes make investments worse, perhaps the amendment is not so useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the contents of the regulations, because I do not believe that we should make regulations in this way. In my opinion, they should have been written into an order or, better still, into the Bill. This is an im-
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
portant matter and we are being asked to accept it by agreeing to this and other clauses. We should have much more opportunity to comment on the sort of regulations which may be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak for a moment in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley). I, too, am concerned that we have no idea what constraints will be imposed upon the Crown Agents in the investments that they make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Agents first came to the attention of the Select Committee through the activities of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) some years ago. Parliament's attention was drawn to the activities of certain of the Agents in investing their moneys in ways which caused social difficulties in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee want it made absolutely clear that the status of the Crown Agents in regard to money is that of trustees. I should like to see the Crown Agents bound to act as trustees in placing their investments. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether that is possible. There must be no doubt in future that the Crown Agents invest their money in a proper and responsible way, and Parliament must be assured on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 43, standing in my name, is to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that clause 15—in common with clause 5(4) and clause 8(3)—sets out yet another set of criteria for the handling of money. I understand from what the Minister of State said earlier that these are different kinds of money and that therefore they should be dealt with in different clauses. All I would say is that they can be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No less an authority than the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies— the parent body which looks after the affairs of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland and Ireland, the Association of Certified Accountants, the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy—having looked at this Bill, came to the conclusion that it enabled regulations to be made describing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
how money held by the Crown Agents or their subsidiaries should be invested, but specifically excluded the investment of money held by the Crown Agents acting as agents. That body considered that there was a stronger argument for regulating what the Crown Agents did with other people's money than with their own and suggested that regulations should be made for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that it was wrong in coming to that conclusion. But the mere fact that so distinguished a body can be mistaken in coming to such a conclusion says something about the parliamentary draftsmanship to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has already referred. Is there not a case for simplifying this clause so that it provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any money for the time being standing to the credit of the Crown Agents shall be held or invested by them in accordance with regulations"</p></blockquote>
—the regulations are those to which my hon. Friend has already referred and about which the Minister will give us some details—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the Crown Agents shall ensure that any money for the time being standing to the credit of any wholly owned subsidiary of the Crown Agents is held or invested in accordance with those regulations."</p></blockquote>
We are referring to different kinds of money in different ways throughout the clauses of the Bill, including clause 15. It is not clear to any of us how the handling of that money is to be regulated. The purpose of my amendment is to try to simplify the series of clauses dealing with this matter in the hope that they will be understood more clearly not only by the Crown Agents themselves, but by the public and accountancy bodies at large.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments would leave the Crown Agents and their wholly owned subsidiary companies free to invest their own funds as they thought fit, subject only to the provision in clause 6(3)(	<i>a</i>) that they may not acquire land except for their own occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment by the Crown Agents in their own name of principals' funds will continue to be subject to regulations under clause 5(4). I shall spend slightly longer in replying to this point because it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill draws a distinction between money held by the Crown Agents in their own name and at their own risk and money held by Crown Agents in the name of and
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
at the risk of their principals. Money held in the Crown Agents' own name and at their own risk includes both their own money and money received from principals and held by them pending disbursement or investment on behalf of a principal in the Crown Agents' own name. All such money is to be invested in accordance with regulations under clause 15 and clause 5(4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, money will also be held and managed by the Crown Agents at the principals' risk. This is to be invested in accordance with general or specific instructions from principals as laid down in schedule 4, paragraph 10. The reason for drawing this distinction will be clear to the Committee. Where the Crown Agents invest in their own name and at their own risk, it is important to ensure that they follow prudent investment policies. In view of past history, I am sure that all members of the Committee will agree that some provision needs to be made for regulating the way in which the Crown Agents invest in their own name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why those considerations should apply in the case of money that the Agents carry at their own risk, but not in the case of money held by them on behalf of principals at the principals' risk. What is the case for having a separate series of regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has quite understood what I said. I said that the first category—money held in the Crown Agents' own name at their own risk—included both their own money and money received from principals that they held pending disbursement or investment on behalf of the principals. I distinguished that group from money held and managed by Crown Agents at the principals' risk. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman misunderstood me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. I am trying to find out why there should be one set of regulations for one lot of money and a different set of regulations for a quite different lot of money. Will the Minister spell out clearly for the Committee the extent to which the regulations differ?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two separate sets of regulations relate, on one hand, to money
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
held in the Crown Agents' own name and at their own risk and, on the other hand, to money held and managed by the Crown Agents at the principals' risk. There are clearly two separate areas here with two separate sets of regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was what I said during the earlier part of my remarks. Where the money is held and managed by the Crown Agents at the principals' risk, it is to be invested in accordance with general or specific instructions from the principals. Where they receive separate and specific instructions from the principals, there will clearly be a need for separate regulations compared with what are needed when they themselves make a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises a substantial point. I understand, from what the Minister said, that the principals can still give instructions to the Crown Agents to invest money in ways that would differ from those allowed to the Agents themselves. The kind of problems that arose at the time of the original criticism of the Crown Agents will, therefore, still be allowed to continue. That is a fundamental issue lying at the heart of the Bill. Will the Minister look at it and consider whether there is a powerful case for ensuring that whatever rules apply to the Crown Agents in respect of money that they hold at their own risk shall also apply to money that they hold on behalf of their principals, not in so far as they direct it into particular investments, but in so far as they prevent it going into what the House of Commons might judge to be not the kind of investments that trustees would normally make?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that there is no regulation for money held at the principal's risk. The principal, on whose behalf the Crown Agents are acting, must be free to give instructions to the Crown Agents about how the money is to be invested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful to get the matter absolutely clear. The hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler) has lighted upon an extremely important point. The Minister has just said that the Crown Agents must be
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
free to invest at the direction of the principals. At first sight, that is absolutely right and clear. But has he taken on board the hon. Gentleman's last point whether that should be entirely and completely at the discretion of the principals? Should there not be an additional filter—we see that there is some provision for it—which expresses the idea that the Crown Agents are not there for investing in that sort of activity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler) asks what is the justification for having those two sets of regulations. If it is a good enough filter for the Crown Agents' money in their own right, should that not be the identical filter to apply to principals, too?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can return to this at a later date. It is a fundamental point, but we cannot take it further because of the nature of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making is that principals' money must be invested according to the principals' instructions. To make principals' own money subject to regulation would prevent the Crown Agents from operating under paragraph 10 of schedule 4(10), which lays down the parameters within which they may operate. This is a matter of some concern at which I shall look again, although I am fairly satisfied that the provision as drafted is adequate to cover points that concern members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could put the point with rather extreme force. If, say, the Government of country gives instructions to the Crown Agents to invest money in brothels in London—deciding that it is a growing thing—do we want the Crown Agents to be free to do so. Such a question has arisen before. In fact, when the Minister announced her decisions on the tightening of the regulations regarding the Crown Agents she made clear that the arrangements embodied in the Bill would be those she proposed—I have forgotten in what form—either in a debate in the House or in an article—and some of us made the point that the kind of property investment that had been possible before would continue to be possible so long as the Government of the overseas country said "I give you 	<i>carte blanche</i> to invest wherever you get the most money" or gave instructions to go into whatever
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
named undesirable activities they wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty between the Crown Agents operating as agents and, therefore, being obliged to act in accordance with instructions and, on the other hand, our desire for them not to go into certain activities even when asked or permitted to do so by the principal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I shall have to look at this further and reflect on the points raised in Committee. However, I reiterate that if principals give instructions they carry the risk: they benefit by any profit and are affected by having to carry any loss. Losses in the past were the Crown Agents' own account losses therefore the Government carried the loss. The Government would not be liable for any losses:incurred on a principal's instructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a principal's instructions were subjected to the type of ministerial screening that has been suggested, it would interfere with the commercial relations between the Crown Agents and their principals and there would be a real danger that principals would take their business elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall look at the matter further to see whether any addition is needed. However, I am satisfied that the point is adequately covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 43, inspired jointly by the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. BrocklebankFowler) and the consultative committee of accountancy bodies. Its effect would be to make the investment of principal's money held by a subsidiary company of the Crown Agents as agents subject to regulations made by the Minister with the approval of the Treasury. The reason for the exclusion is that paragraph 10 of schedule 4, which gives the Crown Agents power to accept and manage funds on behalf of principals, specifies that this is to be done at the risk of principals, in accordance with their general or specific instructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained the reason for the distinction drawn in Clause 15 between money held to the credit of the Crown Agents and money held by them as agents. Where the Crown Agents are managing the investment of principals' money in the name of and at the risk of principals, it is clearly right that the principals should be free to instruct the Crown Agents as to how the money is to be invested
Schedule 4 paragraph 10 therefore empowers the Crown Agents to accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
funds for investment on behalf of a principal and to manage the investment of those funds, but only in accordance with general or specific instructions given by the principal. It would not be right, as I said earlier, to make the management of such money subject to regulations by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I believe the amendment to be unnecessary. It is also imperfect in that it only covers money held by a subsidiary of the Crown Agents as agent and would not affect money held by the Crown Agents themselves as agent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past I have had dealings with some subordinate legislation which was made in a very informal manner. In that case it was not regulations but a scheme. That scheme, although it was the law of the land, was available only in typed form, not in printed form, and so on. There is a difficulty when one has subordinate legislation produced by relatively informal means. May we take it that these regulations, although not a statutory instrument, will be printed and made available not only to Members of the House but also to the public, and will therefore be markedly different from the kind of direction which the Minister could give on the same subject under clause 23? Under that clause, presumably she could just write a letter and tell the Crown Agents to do or not do something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give an undertaking to the Committee that the regulations would be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister be prepared to circulate regulations to members of this Committee before we reach the next stage of the Bill so that we should have the opportunity to raise this matter again at a later stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That I shall have to look at, but my instinctive reaction is that it is highly unlikely that regulations will have been made by that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a good debate on amendment No. 43 but far too little debate on amendment No. 11, which I moved, which concerns the regulations. However, in the course of the debate some interesting different political points of view came to light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) thought that it would be regrettable if any of the principals wished to invest in brothels. I think that it would be even more regrettable if they wished to invest in war loan, because they would lose their money. The likelihood is that the regulations will go against me. They are more likely to prevent investment in brothels than in war loan, although it is quite clear that the former is much the better investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know what these regulations will contain. Are we designing the regulations on moral grounds—are we to exclude slum property, brothels or any sleazy organisation—or are we designing them in order to try and cut out the less good investments? The reason why I tabled my amendment is that it is not clear what the point of the regulations is to be. That is why I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler) in asking that they be published before we reach the last stage of the Bill. We have had no answer on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely that if a principal asks the Crown Agents to make any specific investment—whatever it may be—we should not restrict the power so to do, because the loss or profit is for the principal, and the obloquy is for the principal. If we deny the Crown Agents the power to carry out what the principals ask, the principals can either do it directly or through some other agent. In no sense would we frustrate that investment being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that it is not our business to lay down how the principals shall invest their money. We must make clear that where the principal is taking the risk it is for him to specify, and that that money cannot leak into some private speculations on behalf of the Crown Agents, as happened before. We must make sure that money cannot leak from one fund to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
am not satisfied about the regulations. I hope that the Government will publish them, because I think that there is an unresolved problem here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be possible for us to give a draft of the proposed regulations to members of the Committee before further stages. That draft would be subject to revision, but it
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
would give members of the Committee a general indication of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, all hon. Members here today are right in saying that the key point in clause 15 is that we must be sure that any money held by the Crown Agents other than money held by them as agents is —"prudently" is the favourite word in Whitehall—prudently invested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is here a mix of morals and economic sense. There was a mix in 1974 when I issued the first directive to the Crown Agents saying that they must no longer engage in either the property market or secondary banking. I shall not enter into another feminist argument about brothels, but it seemed to me to be morally wrong that they were engaged in certain kinds of property speculation. And it was also sheer economic nonsense, because both the secondary banks and the property market were then being hammered. There is a mix—there is bound to be a mix—and Whitehall chooses a rather good word to include all these things when it uses the adjective "prudent".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know who this new feminist creature is—this "Prudence" who has come upon the scene—but I think that she will prove extremely difficult to define. I am very much looking forward to seeing how she is defined in the draft regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very handsome of the Government to offer to produce these draft regulations before the next stage. In view of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to elucidate further the position of the initial debt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
which the Crown Agents will take on under clause 17(1). I see that the debt is to be due to the Minister and not to any pre-existing Crown Agents. Will this debt be a burden to the Crown Agents in providing their normal services at reasonable rates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the justification for the new Crown Agents being saddled with this debt at the beginning? Would it not have been more natural for the new Crown Agents simply to take on the assets of the old Crown Agents—one expected that—without being required to pay for them, as it were, as an initial part of their financial activities? I do not understand the rationale behind saddling them with this burden at the outset. I perfectly understand that the losses previously incurred by the former Crown Agents should, if at all possible, be repaid to Her Majesty's Government. If this arrangement is intended to provide a security for that I can understand it, but an explanation would be useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was generally felt that in all the circumstances it was prudent that there should be a sum of money which came from the Government but came from the Government in the shape of a debt from the National Loans Fund. The £25 million of commencing debt will be Government money, provided by the taxpayer through the Government and, rather than provide it by way of a grant, it was thought more prudent—to use a word that has been used several times this morning—that it should be a debt on which interest would be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend knows, for the first five years full interest may not be paid on that £25 million, but when the initial period is past full interest will be paid, in accordance with the National Loans Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is a more prudent and sensible way of operating, especially in view of what has happened in the past in relation to the Crown Agents. I do not imagine that they themselves would object. This provision will mean that they can operate as much as possible as a commercial body. They will see that there are interest payments that have to be met and, no doubt, they will order their affairs accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand. is it intended that the Government will provide the Crown Agents with £25 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. To some extent that is a fiction in that it has been decided, and it is deemed for the purposes of this legislation, that the Crown Agents will owe the Government—and ultimately the taxpayer—£25 million as an initial commencing debt, and that interest will be paid on that debt. I fail to see what my hon. Friend's objection is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us assume that the former Crown Agents bought a building recently and that they paid for it out of cash or had a loan and are servicing that loan. So the Crown Agents have that building and they also have, I assume, the burden of servicing the loan that they used to pay for it. Why, in addition, should they have a debt to the Treasury for £25 million deemed to exist? What have they received to balance this book debt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They received no money actually.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. If we are saying that we have put £120 million, or whatever sum, into the Crown Agents because of their past losses, and as a sort of token on that we want to see them booked as owing £25 million to the Government, I understand that as the reasoning. But I must say that since the Minister has the power to order the Crown Agents to pay back anything which he thinks is surplus to their current requirements so that we do get some of our money back, I find it hard to combine that power with the £25 million initial paper debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that when the new Crown Agents come into existence they will take over the property of the old Crown Agents in the form of buildings, offices, typewriters, cash in the bank and investments, which they would otherwise get for free? Surely, the point is that that £25 million represents the value of the assets which they will take over. I do not know whether it is the right value for those assets, but that is what the figure represents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may amplify the point. The £25 million is made up of £19 million for the assets, which they have, and £6 million which they might need for reserves. Perhaps I should remind my hon.

Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) makes. In these circumstances, if one were aplying the full principles of commercialism, one might be in that position. We felt that the best way to regularise the position was to say that the commencing debt represents the fixed assets plus £6 million for working capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, they must have bought something a little while ago. In taking over the £19 million worth of assets, had they any obligation to meet the costs of those assets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist. It is always a problem when one incorporates a body which has hitherto not been incorporated that one has to make an assessment in determining the value of the assets and the return to the Government, the level of interest and all the arrangements covered by the clause. On this occasion we had to asses the value of the property they occupied and how much working capital they would need. It is the essence of the problem of transferring them into an incorporated public body. I do not think that problem is avoidable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could argue whether it should be this or that amount, but that is a different matter. One has to make an assumption as to how one asesses the caital value of the assets they posses as the starting points for incorporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am not quite sure what they must do to require them to borrow heavily for the future and I should be surprised in they engaged in a great deal of own account activities in future. I am of the opinion that they will not need to do a great deal of borrowing under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a matter of some importance here. If [they have to borrow, then, rather than borrow from the Minister— that is, the taxpayer—why not borrow vfrom the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From secondary banks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. Borrowing from secondary banks is very different from lending to them, as the right hon. Lady will know. There is no harm in borrowing from a dud bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic effects of borrowing from the Treasury are totally different from borrowing from the market. For Governments wishing to control the money supply, the limitation of their own lending is an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should move more towards getting these concerns to borrow from the market. They will then have to pay the going rate for money at the time. The question then arises whether the Treasury will guarantee it. Indeed, if the Treasury has to guarantee those borrowings, there is no great virtue in not lending the money oneself. I am not pleading that there should be a Treasyur guarantee behind these borrowings. If the Crown Agents wish and are allowed to go into various ventures, they should borrow their money in a perfectly normal way from the market. I should like to hear arguments as to why they should not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
Loans Fund than from the market. The Government cannot make a loss on lending from the National Loans Fund, but the terms are finer and nationalised bodies—and the Crown Agents will be a nationalised body—will no doubt continue to borrow from the Government, unless there is a change of Government. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman would do if he were in a position of responsibility. I am sure it would be very interesting. Obviously it would cost more for the Crown agents to borrow in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is a fundamental difference between us on this issue. I have heard the hon. Gentleman give his views on this matter before. He maintains that borrowing in the market would be a form of discipline on public bodies. There are, however, other disciplines which the Government can and do impose on public bodies. We think it only right that the Crown Agents should be dealt with in exactly the same way as any other public body in this respect and should be enabled to borrow from Ministers—that is, from the National Loans Fund—as provided in this legislation. These amendments would prevent them doing so in future. One side effect would be that the Crown Agents would not be able to roll over their existing debt if conditions were different. They would have to go to the market; they would not be able to come back to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the question of the money supply. Hon. Gentlemen know that it does not make any difference whether a public body borrows from the Government or from the market. The public sector borrowing requirement is still a borrowing, and money supply targets relate to that borrowing. We are concerned here with the cost of money. The cost to the Crown Agents will be lower if they borrow from the Government as provided in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister skirts too easily over the money supply problems. He must have been sweating through the long nights, with his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, trying to grapple with the £11 billion borrowing requirement.

	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
requirement, the less he will have to get from the banks and the less inflation there will be. I was trying to make a contribution to the fight against inflation, but the hand that I prudentley proffered to the right hon. Gentleman has been bitten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the time or place to argue this matter at length. I think it right that we should record our disagreement and move on to consider other matters. So, instead of withdrawing the amendment, I should prefer that it be negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to bite another finger of the hon. Gentleman's hand. Of course, we cannot this morning engage in a great philosophical and economic discussion. But the hon. Gentleman must appreciate that, if the public sector borrows at a higher rate of interest from private sector banking, in terms of the hon. Gentleman's economic beliefs, it will have to raise its prices to cover the higher cost of that borrowing. I shall not ask the hon. Gentleman to explain now how that helps inflation, but perhaps he could explain it to us on some other occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley). This Government have mismanaged the economy. The United Kingdom Government had at one point a lower borrowing ability and standing on the New York stock exchange than, for instance, British Petroleum. There was a time when the British Government would not have had an AAA rating on the New York stock exchange. Moreover, borrowing by the United Kingdom Government this year through the sale of gilts has also been so mishandled that the Government have paid far more for their money that a prudently handled nationalised industry. There is therefore a strong argument for allowing a body such as the Crown Agents to do their own borrowing direct rather than to make them borrow from the Government at much higher rates since the Government need to take a turn in lending on to their subsidiaries. Those are valid points. However, I shall not seek to pursue them too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go into what the hon. Gentleman said about the British Government borrowing in New York. Every time the Government have borrowed, they have had the highest rating.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
I shall not go into the question of the gilts market either, although, when we form the next Administration, perhaps we should consider the operation of that market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to say, as the hon. Gentleman did, that it would cost more to borrow from the Government. Under the Bill, the Crown Agents would borrow from the National Loans Fund. The terms on that are finer than can be obtained in the gilt-edged market or any other market, because of the very nature of the operation. The Government's turn is very small. The only obligation on the Government is not to make a loss on that operation. It is not correct, therefore, to say that they will pay more. They are bound to pay less if they borrow from the National Loans Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will cost more for the Crown Agents to borrow in the market, because the rate is bound to be higher. We have provided that they should be allowed to borrow from the National Loans Fund so that they can borrow at the cheapest rate available, whatever may be the rate of interest on the commercial market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are related to the same problem as that in our previous debate on Clause 18. That debate concerned the manner in which the Crown Agents and their wholly owned subsidiaries might borrow money. On this clause and this amendment we are discussing the limit to the amount of money that the Crown Agents may borrow from whatever source. I shall not now prolong the discussion on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like from the right hon. Lady a clear exposition of the criteria for the selection of these limits of £50 million or £80 million by order. I do not quarrel with the right to permit the Crown Agents to borrow, nor with the right to set limits—certainly not on the last matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are two factors here. One concerns the Government's broad economic policy which, when we look at our economic conditions, must contain the objective of restraining the amount of borrowing. In my view and that of my hon. Friends that borrowing is at present excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second factor is that it is most important to impose a clear discipline on the Crown Agents. The Committee ought to be given the justification for the figures that have been chosen. Is any parallel drawn here with other public sector bodies? Why has the right hon. Lady picked these figures in relation to the Crown Agents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can explain the matter satisfactorily to the hon. Member for Shoreham (Mr. Luce). I fully understand his point, and it is right that he should explore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the clause limits the total amount that the Crown Agents may have outstanding to £50 million, and it provides that that may be increased up to £80 million with the consent of the Treasury and the approval of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The borrowing limits for the Crown Agents, as for the realisation hoard, are designed to cover a five-year period. The lower limit, which covers the first three years, is based fairly precisely on three main items.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
The first item is the National Loans Fund capital to cover the commencing capital debt, which we have just discussed on a previous amendment. That is £25 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the realisation board. This clause refers to the Crown Agents. Could the Minister make the position clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me repeat what I said. I shall do so slowly, because the matter is somewhat complex. The borrowing limits for the Crown Agents, as for the realisation board, are designed to cover a five-year period. The lower limit—that is, the £50 million—covers the first three years, and it is based on three items.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the National Loans Fund capital of £25 million is to cover the capital debt with which the Crown Agents begin. We have just discussed that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second item is the funding of principals' overdrafts. These are largely overdrafts inherited from the unincorporated Agents. That is about £8 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third item is the provision for increase in working capital, allowing for a modest degree of inflation and a small real increase. That is £5 million. That brings us to £38 million. To that we have added a general provision for contingencies of £10 million. That brings us up to £48 million. We have—reasonably, I think—rounded that up to £50 million. That is the breakdown. I hope that meets the hon. Gentleman's query.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"as being uneconomic functions which they would not otherwise undertake, ".</p></blockquote>
Under this clause the Minister has power to make grants to the Crown Agents. I do not know what sort of grant is envisaged. Why is the power to make grants to be provided? I have no objection to making grants if some specific duty or purpose is required of the Crown Agents which they would not otherwise pursue. I cannot think of any such circumstances. If the Crown Agents wanted to place a contract with firm A, because it was cheaper than firm B, the Government—perhaps for a social reason—might make a grant in order to secure the work with firm B. There may be other uneconomic social requirements for a grant being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we are on another point of principle here, although it has minimal application to the Crown Agents. If the Government or local government require a nationalised industry to do anything which it would not otherwise do because it was uneconomic, the authority requiring that service to be provided should carry the uneconomic cost of it on its Vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not object to this power, but I should like that point to be confirmed by the inclusion of the amendment. There may be other reasons for these grants. If so, I am sure the right hon. Lady will tell us. There is an important point of principle here, and we may be fairly near agreement upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a lot of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's amendment. I see exactly why he has tabled it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Ministry of Overseas Development were to make a grant under the clause for something which was not economic, it would most probably be for an overseas development purpose. For example, if the ODM or the Minister wanted the Crown Agents to continue a service to a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
dependency which in itself would not yield a good economic return—frequently services to the smaller territories are not economic—the Minister would be empowered to make a grant. Such a grant woudl clearly be carried on the ODM Vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of accountability, we are covered. I hope that I have sufficiently explained the point about unecomic functions. I am sure that hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that an acceptable explanation. I agree with it, but that does not mean that I agree with any particular social or overseas development policy that may be pursued.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments deal with the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would hazard—drafting errors apart—that if these amendments had applied in the early 1970s hon. Members sitting on Select Committees, particularly the Public Accounts Committee, would have got on to this before anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, reading the Fay report, that the Comptroller and Auditor General's position in relation to the Crown Agents was an extraordinarily weak one. He, more than anybody, suspected that things were amiss and he told the Bank of England and the Treasury. But nothing happened. In due course, he probably told the Public Accounts Committee. I do not know what happened in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now moving to a state where the Comptroller and Auditor General is identified as a servant of the House of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
Commons who is there, with his staff, acting as a watchdog for the House of Commons over the expenditure and investment of public money. Although the Government have not fully accepted this—a review of the role of Comptroller and Auditor General is taking place—there are proposals for legislation and Select Committees are actively considering the details of his position, function and role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make two points regarding the Bill. It is difficult, because one does not want to pre-empt what might come out of the review of the Comptroller's position. But, on the other hand, if we do not amend the Bill, it will not contain what we want. The Comptroller, responsible to Parliament, should lay down the standards of accounting which we expect. The difficult questions of depreciation, historic cost or replacement cost, inflation accounting and matters of that sort, should be treated as a standard across the public sector, the standards being laid down by him. Most people are beginning to be aware that the criteria and standards used in accounting in the nationalised industries vary from industry to industry, which is a most unsatisfactory position. That is the reason for the first amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 22 brings the Comptroller into the group of people who will be given copies of the accounts as audited. He should have the right to go through that audited account, asking further questions if he is not satisfied, reporting thereon to the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to make his role clearer and stronger that I move the amendments. I shall accept the criticism, if proffered by the Government, that it might be better to do this after the Bill dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General has been published. By that time, however, this Bill will have become an Act of Parliament, so I cannot do that. For a short debate, it seems to me right that these issues should be raised now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) said I believe, that amendment No. 20 sought to provide that the Comptroller should lay down the standards of accounting. In fact, the amendment does not do that. The amendment is to a subsection which clearly provides that the standards of accounting shall be "the best commercial standards". That is the difference from the previous position. We have here
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
in legislation an absolute requirement that the accounts of the Crown Agents:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall conform to the best commercial standards".</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman really intended that the standards should be laid down by the Comptroller or anyone else. We are providing for the best commercial standards to operate. In addition—and we have dealt with this matter on the previous amendment—there may from time to time be certain areas where the Government may wish to provide for further information to be contained in the statement of accounts. That is what subsections (4)(a), (b) and (c) are about and why we put forward the previous set of amendments—to ensure that there was no clash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 would remove the Minister's power to seek that additional information and to lay down what kind of information he requires. It has nothing to do with standards of accounting. That is not the right way of dealing with the matter. At the end of the day, it is the Minister who is responsible to Parliament, and the Minister, having accepted that the accounts must be prepared according to the best commercial standards, should be allowed, if he wishes, to seek for additional information to be provided. That responsibility cannot be shifted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, however good we know his work may be. It has to be a ministerial matter once we have provided for the accounting standards to be of the highest. Amendment No. 20 really does not, therefore, meet the point that the hon. Gentleman wished to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we can meet the hon. Gentleman on amendment No. 22, because the Bill provides now for what it seeks to do. The hon. Gentleman wished to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have a copy of the accounts. The Bill provides that a copy of the accounts is to be laid before each House of Parliament. The PAC would then be entitled to pick up those accounts and inquire into them, and the Comptroller and Auditor General would play his part there. There is no question of his being bypassed.

I believe that the points made by the hon. Gentleman are met in the Bill, and that the amendments would not improve the position. Indeed, amendment No. 20 would make the position worse than it is. The Bill meets the legitimate needs of the House for proper commercial standards

and proper accountability to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The old, unreformed Crown Agents did have their accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General under a Treasury minute instruction. But the Comptroller and Auditor General was not answerable in respect of that activity to the Public Accounts Committee of the House, any more than he is when he audits accounts of that nature for other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had thought that it was intended that the Comptroller and Auditor General would not necessarily play any role in the accounts of the new body because of subsection (5), where the Minister is given power to nominate the auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it envisaged that the Minister would nominate the Comptroller and Auditor General under that subsection as the person to carry out the audit? Or is it envisaged that it would be commercial auditors? I see that the Minister is indicating that it would be commercial auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case I am a bit puzzled about one remark by the Minister of State as to how the Comptroller and Auditor General gets in on the act at all. I seethat the accounts are to be laid before Parliament. I see that the PAC can pursue. Can it? I am not sure that it can. It has had a role only in the last few years because Government money was being provided. Its entree to the Crown Agents was the fact that the Government were providing God knows how many millions to the Crown Agents. When the Government are not doing that, I am not sure that the PAC has a locus to make an investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore comes to this: what is expected to be the roles of the PAC and the Comptroller and Auditor General, bearing in mind that those two things do not necessarily go together? The Comptroller and Auditor General in the past had a role vis-a-vis the Crown Agents, without the PAC having a role. It is conceivable that it might work the other way round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the PAC can look at any report that is laid before Parliament, as my hon. Friend will know, having served on that Committee. We served on it together. It has a wide-ranging function—a much
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
wider-ranging function than any other Select Committee of the House. The PAC can inquire into any report. Whether that formally means that the Comptroller and Auditor General can get in on the act, I do not know, but in practice, he assists the PAC in the way it conducts its inquiries. I should have thought that the Comptroller and Auditor General would then be part of that operation. Basically one must make it clear that the PAC—the watchdog over expenditure—has this role, can play this role and can use its powers if it thinks fit in relation to these reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that was a thoroughly unsatisfactory reply from the Minister of State. He did a lot of drafting nit-picking which may look good on a Treasury brief but he did not respond to the point of principle about what should be the relationship between this House, the Comptroller, the Minister and the Crown Agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment because of the time factor, but for no other reason. We must think much more carefully about how the House is to receive information about what goes on in nationalised industries and get it quickly, and how the Comptroller and Auditor General can have a much greater role to play. Clearly, it is not possible to work all that out in the next few minutes. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 18, line 39, leave out "Minister" and insert "Crown Agents".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to discuss Government amendment No. 47.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ridley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point raised in the amendment has been met half-way by the Government in amendment No. 47. The question concerns who should appoint the auditors. I believe it is true that in all other nationalised industries they appoint them themselves. I think that is right, although there should be some power of supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggests that he should appoint the auditors after consultation with the Crown Agents. I would prefer the Crown Agents to appoint the auditors after consultation with the Minister. If the Minister would meet me on that, I would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
be happier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a totally new departure for nationalised industries and one I am not too happy about. The central appointment of auditors by the Government will end up with there being a shortlist of approved auditors who will receive all the favoured business. Some very large fees are involved in connection with public sector auditing. It should be much more open to all competitors. I am frightened that we shall have a favoured list and deny new firms the chance to get in. I am therefore, not too happy about that, although the Minister's amendment goes some of the way to making me happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Government amendment No. 47 makes him somewhat happy, not very happy, but at least it goes some way to meeting his point. Perhaps at the appropriate time the hon. Gentleman would signify that, although he is not very happy, he would be prepared grudgingly to accede to amendment No. 47. From the Government's point of view, amendment No. 21 goes too far. I think that there must be some Ministerial oversight here. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's views. The Minister is ultimately responsible to Parliament. I feel that this is the best way within our system with which matters can be dealt. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be prepared to go along with Government amendment No. 47, as meeting him part of the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
clause where, in my view, we could deal, if we so wished, with the point raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler) about prohibiting the Crown Agents from doing things, even when they are acting as agents. I wish to make the point at this stage because, as I have said before, I feel that there should be some limitations upon what the Crown Agents can do, even when they are acting as agents. I do not think that it would be right—and it would be blatantly in conflict with agency status—to have advance rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister should use her power to request information in order to satisfy herself at any given time whether they are doing anything of this kind that she does not like. If they are doing something—such as investing in brothels, or whatever it may be—she should use her powers of direction to prohibit it. I think I am right in saying that at the moment she would not be able to do that if they were acting as agents. I should like to leave the point for consideration later whether, even at this late stage, it would not be right to reverse the position and make it a qualification to their total freedom to do whatever they are permitted or instructed to do by an agent by giving the Minister power to give them directions. That would involve deleting the words "in their own right".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause sets up the Crown Agents Holding and Realisation Board which deals with the Four Millbank group of companies. Schedule 5, with which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
we will deal in a moment, has six complex pages of regulations, which bind this board much closer to Ministerial direction than the others. Clause 1 and Schedule 1, however, do not mention the word "board".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I wish to raise is a practical one. The Board of the Crown Agents will consist of six to 10 members both at home and abroad, appointed by the Minister. In common parlance some word will have to be used, and it will be "board". I suggest that the use of the word "board" in the following schedule might cause some complications, both in general language and possibly in understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I intervene? I am sure that my hon.

Indeed, there was one dangerous moment when it seemed to me that there was about to be a volcanic eruption between the two sides on matters of philosophy, but at the last moment prudence intervened. It has been a harmonious occasion. We owe much to you, Mrs. Butler, for the efficient and agreeable way in which you have chaired our sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank both the Minister and the hon.
