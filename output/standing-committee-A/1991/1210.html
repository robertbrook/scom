	<time>Tuesday 10 December 1991</time>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL LATHAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Transport and Works Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during consideration of the Transport and Works Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. McLoughlin.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the sittings motion, but I must caution the Minister that the Opposition will expect the Government to concede some amendments. Obviously, the more willing they are to concede a few issues, the more likely we are to consider the Bill in a reasonable time. Let me draw to the Minister's attention my shopping list, which will encourage me to make shorter speeches and render it unnecessary for him to suggest that we should sit in the afternoons. I want to raise the issue of the statutory instrument procedures in the Bill. On Second Reading we made it clear that some issues were not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, while others were subject to annulment. We want many of them to be made affirmative rather than negative procedures. I shall not press that further now, but it might save time if I do not have to make too many such references during our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is the question of the major order that would come before Parliament about major schemes being amendable. I know that there is much anxiety about whether statutory instruments should be amendable. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) and others will cite the example of the census order as one way of making amendments. However, there should be an amendable order for major schemes. For examples, when the King's Cross Railways Bill came before Parliament, there was an instruction to the Committee, which was not successful, suggesting that the station should be built above ground rather than under ground. The only way that it would be possible under the new procedure for Parliament to express such an opinion is if we build into this legislation the ability to amend the statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have written already to the Minister about whether Parliament should have a final say, particularly if the Minister decides to make a final recommendation that is at variance with the suggestion of the inspector of the public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to make concessions on footpaths. I hope that he can assure us that the fears expressed by the Inland Waterways Association and other bodies can be allayed. It would seem that provision to protect inland waterways has come low down on the list of priorities in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wants to make speedy progress and if the rumours of the suggested finishing time are correct—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister would achieve that speedy progress by answering the five or six points that I have raised this morning. On the basis that he can satisfy us on some of those issues, I do not oppose the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), the hand of co-operation has been extended already early in our proceedings. I do not want to delay our deliberations and, in response to the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), I must say that as the Bill was not opposed on Second Reading, the Opposition support many of its provisions. However, there are as many aspects that we want to amend. Having noted that the Committee has been handpicked for brevity, I am sure that the Minister will think deeply before replying to the sittings motion because one wrong word could lead us into more delay than any of us would wish. I hope that we can proceed as we have begun and that the Minister can reply positively to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Dixon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Jarrow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason for us to sit on Thursday mornings as hon. Members will be preparing for the Christmas Adjournment and dealing with pressing constituency matters. The Government will receive co-operation on the Bill, for which there is no real hurry. It has taken years to change the private Bill procedure, so there is no reason to rush the Bill through Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider the decision to sit on Thursday mornings before the Christmas Adjournment. We should sit only on Tuesday of this week and on Tuesday of next week and allow hon. Members to have this Thursday morning off to prepare their speeches for the Christmas Adjournment and next Thursday morning off to get their presents for Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) said, we did not oppose the Bill on Second Reading. We shall offer some co-operation, which we expect the Government to reciprocate by conceding that until Christmas the Committee should sit only on Tuesday mornings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise the issue of consultation with outside bodies. In view of the letters that I, and no doubt other hon. Members, have received, it may be better to sit initially on Tuesdays only rather than make rapid progress on the Bill. Various inland waterways associations, such as the National Association of Boat Owners and the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council, have made clear that they feel strongly that consultation should have taken place and that the inclusion of the clauses affecting waterways is ill judged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If consideration of the Bill during the remainder of 1991 were confined to Tuesdays, that might permit the Minister to engage in consultation and meet the strong representations that have been made. Has the Minister made provision for consultation, and if so, how long will that take? After examining the position, in keen consultation with his officials, he might decide that it is better to confine our sittings to Tuesdays to begin with. I am not saying that Thursday sittings will not be necessary in 1992, but in view of the representations it would be better to sit only on Tuesdays in the initial stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on consultation because the sole topic of the letters that I have received has been a strong sense of injustice at the lack of consultation. As we all agree that we want to encourage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the preservation and use of our canal and inland waterway system, we should take those points into account when we consider the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I walked into the Room, I did not intend to speak on the sittings motion. However, it would be more appropriate to mention one or two points now rather than later. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) mentioned the ejaculation that I made when I heard rumours of an informal agreement. The Committee is in an unusual position. The purposes of the Bill are broadly agreed. The Bill was unchallenged on Second Reading. Some hon. Members may have reservations about the broad agreement that was reached. It was a procedural, and, therefore, a constitutional agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike many commentators, I belive that the procedures of the House—probing amendments, replies, withdrawn amendments, new clauses, Report stage—and consideration in the House of Lords, will be useful for the Bill. There are neither differences in objective nor any reasons for party differences on the main thrust of the Bill. Differences may exist about minor details, but the personal and constituency interests of, for example, the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) in railways and the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Thorne) in new tramways in Ilford, are not primarily party matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a procedural and constitutional measure, which deals with the rights of Parliament, electors, private individuals and corporations in the sphere of transport. There is a common demand for timetabling Bills. I hope that we will be economical with the time that we spend on the Bill. However, I also hope that we will probe and discuss properly a subject that has many more angles than is currently supposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcomed the Bill on Second Reading. I shall raise one or two issues in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation with the Inland Waterways Association has been mentioned. The Minister promised on Second Reading to consult the association either before or during the Committee stage. Perhaps he can explain further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon). It is right for the Committee to sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings during the initial stages of our proceedings. I do not think that members of the Committee need much time to prepare their speeches. Tuesday and Thursday this week and next week will be normal parliamentary sitting days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) is worried about what concessions the Government are willing to make. We shall listen to all the arguments and representations. Christmas presents are not usually distributed before 25 December, but who knows what may be possible in this spirit of cordiality?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, North—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bradford, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry, Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer)—mentioned consultations. I am always prepared to meet delegations and hear representations on the Bill. I will inform the Committee about our meetings with the Inland
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Waterways Association, which took place last Friday. I shall also provide some information when we discuss clause 3</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that an agreement had been reached between the Minister and the Inland Waterways Association after Second Reading. Does the Minister realise that that agreement is a matter for further discussion and clarification?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Inland Waterways Association will want to suggest further amendments and that the Committee will discuss them at the appropriate stage. Consultations have taken place and some discussions were held last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night I met the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Adley) to discuss some of the problems with non-statutory railway bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he would tell us about the outcome of his meeting with the Inland Waterways Association when we discuss clause 3, but we may not reach that clause this morning. The sooner he enlightens the Committee, the sooner we may be able to withdraw some of our amendments and avoid tabling others. Amendments take up time, so it would be helpful if the Minister would let us know what outside groups he has met and on which points we should focus our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I have already made a copy of some points available to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley). I see no problem in making available other copies to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) kindly sent me a letter yesterday. Unfortunately, I did not receive it until late last night; it was on the board, but I just did not see it. He made several points which I am willing to discuss at greater length outside the Committee. I am sorry that I was not able to give him a more positive reply last night and I thank him for the letter. I agree with him. I hope that we can consider the Bill in a reasonable, sensible manner, because the issues are important. The Bill is very welcome as was shown by the report of the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure and the reaction on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) raised points about consultation with members of the Committee and the Minister. I find it unusual that I have received handwritten letters among the representations that have been made to me as well as formal representations from organisations. All members of the Committee probably need more time to develop their work. Thursday sittings should be set aside to allow us to pursue some matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not necessarily a good idea. We should make some progress on the Bill—it is important for the way in which we deal in future with private legislation. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will support the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during consideration of the Transport and Works Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two announcements. Before I call the order of consideration motion, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments. I call the Minister to move the order of consideration motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. Perhaps you could explain what the standing order on quorums means in this Committee? Standing Order No. 89 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the quorum of a standing committee shall be seventeen or one third of the number of its members excluding the chairman, whichever is the less; and in calculating the quorum fractions shall be counted as one."</p></blockquote>
As the Select Committee on Selection has now decided that the 18-person Committee should be a 19-person Committee, am I right to assume that seven is a quorum for this Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. The Chairman has to see six Members in front of him—the quorum is seven, including the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a privilege to initiate the first debate on this important Bill. I shall not be brief, and I do not apologise for that because what I say in our debate on these amendments will save time later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his comments. I wrote to tell him and his advisers of the general drift of my remarks and to give cohesion to the amendments that I have tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after 'section', insert 'and section 3'".</p></blockquote>
The first part of the Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, seeks to establish
	<br><blockquote><p>"a system of Ministerial orders in England and Wales for authorising railway, tramway and other guided transport schemes; canal works; and other works which would interfere with navigation. It provides a means of avoiding the need for special enactments for these purposes."</p></blockquote>
In other words, legislation that was hitherto "private" will be replaced by statutory instruments. I ask the Minister what constitutes an "order"? That is the term used in clauses 1 and 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "order" is an important term. It appears in the proposal in lower case but it comes from an authority. An order must be obeyed; it is something from which there is no escape. If there is a dispute about whether it is being obeyed, it is for a court to decide whether it should be. It is an engine of authority, and I make no complaint about that. Until now, the authority has been the House. The high court of Parliament decided on sometimes complex changes in the law, as the courts judge an appeal. We are replacing what was done with the advice and consent of Parliament assembled—to use the age-old phrase in the preamble to any Bill—with the views and wishes first, of a Minister of the Crown, a member of the Executive and, potentially, with an authoritarian person or body. Anyone who wanted to introduce authoritarian institutions to this country would have only to table a one-clause Bill expanding the power of statutory instruments. That is no secret. It could be done relatively easily and would comply with constitutional and legal requirements, although I hope that no members of the Committee would go along with that. Therefore, power would be transferred from more than 600 persons to at least one person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one small safeguard, to which my hon. Friends may wish to refer. Time and again, we read in the Bill that the order is
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
In plain language, it is a negative instrument. Unfortunately, a negative instrument is not always given time on the Floor of the House. It might get less that an hour and a half after 10 o'clock. There is only a tenuous possibility of Parliament having control over any exercise of such an instrument by a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are substituting the Privy Council's authority and the Crown's prerogatives for the prerogatives of Parliament. That is why I described the Bill as constitutional and procedural.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private legislation, understandably, is seen as archaic and time-wasting. It provides opportunities for hon. Members to use Standing Orders to delay legislation that a tiny minority do not want. It can entail weeks in Committee listening to well-paid people in wigs. It takes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
up the time of hon. Members who might otherwise be engaged in their proper duties. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) is here today. He is only too well aware of the constitutional and procedural matters that attended the committee that considered the King's Cross Railways Bill, which he chaired. If we were making a film of our proceedings, we could set the scene in an out-of-date, fusty Dickensian Parliament with a Jarndyce v. Jarndyce type case in which everything was tied up in ridiculous knots. That is not a difficult picture to paint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, anyone could petition a Bill. Indeed, privately promoted legislation is still done by petition. Petitioning is a fundamental democratic right. "Erskine May" states that private Bills conferring
	<br><blockquote><p>"particular powers or benefits on any person or body of persons—including individuals, local authorities, statutory corporations or private corporations—in excess of or in conflict with the general law."</p></blockquote>
In other words, they are out of kilter with what is universal throughout the realm and are entertained only if there is good reason for necessary legislation other than public Bills, including the so-called private Member's Bill, which are general legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private Bills are required because nowadays they are of general public benefit. Although it may mean temporarily overriding private rights with proper compensation or protection, the general benefit is beyond doubt. In the past the procedure may have been misused. For example, the Enclosure Acts had social repercussions. Later, private powers were used for building roads and for collecting the relevant fees at turnpikes. It seems that, with bridges and the possibility of new turnpike roads, we have returned to that era now. The canals and the railways were also examples of the same procedure, to which nobody objected because of its benefit to society. Parliament had to ensure that such legislation did not tread underfoot the private rights of people, corporations or the benefits of the realm and that proper compensation and protection was provided. Those of us who have been involved with the subject—I note that most hon. Members in the Committee have been—will know that the result was the familiar phrase "no prejudicial affection". That was what had to be proved in the evidence given to a private Bill Committee. In the end, a sort of justice was achieved and that is why we must be careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 34 would provide an intermediate stage in addition to the relatively short and narrow statutory instrument—we get a bit suspicious when such documents are too thick. Three questions spring to mind about a private Bill. First, is it necessary? Secondly, is it in the broad public benefit or does it confer undue benefit on private persons or corporations? Thirdly, is there justice and equity for people who might be disadvantaged in the small scale? In other words, we must take account of the macro-balance and the micro-balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer of such judgments to the Executive, as the Bill proposes, is an enormous constitutional step. Amendment No. 34 would provide that the Bill require a second document. A statutory instrument is a trigger mechanism, and amendment No. 34 states that the order:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall specify a scheme, or schemes, of work in accordance with the description specified in Schedule 1 or any other section of this Act."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
We are not just dealing with an order but with what, in statutory terms, is a scheme of work—a full description of the works and surrounding conditions which must be executed to fulfil the purposes of the Act. The amendment suggests that schedule 1 be converted into a description of what must be included in such a scheme of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 34 would change the existing title of schedule 1 to cover a description of matters to be included in any scheme of work. At present, schedule 1 contains a common-sense list of 18 matters that would be expected to be involved in the discussion before a statutory instrument is laid before the House by the Minister. Those matters are usually listed somewhere in the private Bill, but that list is not always complete. Schedule 1 is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Matters within sections 1 and 3".</p></blockquote>
I suggest that we add to the list, sufficient maps and plans of the various works, a section dealing with environmental assessment, which is not evident in the Bill, and a table to show properties involved. That is already used in private Bills as a schedule of properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list is minimal, but we can add to it. There is no reason why a description of works should not include other matters that need to be included on a particular project. Such a statutory requirement, which is described in statute, will be essential in the course of inquiries that the Bill will set in train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been helpful and sent us a summary of order-making procedure. In effect, that sets up, under the aegis of the Department of Transport a parallel system to existing planning inquiries with which we are familiar. I am happy to give way to any hon. Member in the development of my thesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some public inquiries are small and others are extensive. Problems sometimes arise. Inspectors from the Department of the Environment administer such inquiries, but not without some difficulty and controversy. The Bill gives power to the Department of Transport to set up a similar and parallel system of public inquiry. Unless there is a specification on a description of works, public activity cannot be focused properly at the inquiry to give it the necessary bite. The parallel planning procedure includes a planning application. The Secretary of State's request to the inspector to investigate the matter covers all aspects involved in a planning application. There should be a parallel library of documents which comes within the description of the works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the Joint Committee, whose recommendations formed the Bill, had in mind the analogy of planning applications. When a large planning application or a compulsory purchase order is made for some project, perhaps for a school or power station, the procedures are relatively well known. People have asked, not unreasonably, that if we can follow the procedures for those applications, why cannot we follow them for private Bills?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have said that if we can have a planning application for a motorway, why cannot we have one for a road, a tramway or a waterway? The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) nods his head. The idea is attractive, but we must draw a distinction between a mode of transport and a system of transport. The hon. Member for Faversham looks puzzled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we cross New Palace Yard, the road is a public space. Parliament has dedicated the road outside to the public. We are all implicated in the raft of legislation, which has been passed and modified by the House and which deals
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
with different aspects of that environment; for example, the ownership of the road; the maintenance of its surface, the construction, use and licensing of the vehicles that pass over it; the highway code; criminal law; the courts; the police and so on. An infrastructure of law, custom and practice is understood and taken for granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a very different sort of law and civic infrastructure exists for a transport system. A transport system requires additional mechanical devices, a system of access or non-access for persons. It sometimes requires complex machinery; it needs civil engineering works, which require considerable maintenance. The system also requires the development of techniques—the House has historically kept abreast of those, especially those on railways, airways and waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Committee meets two days after the problems in the Severn tunnel and all the consequent reports on the Floor of the House about system accidents. Apart from occasional motorway pile-ups, we do not have reports of system accidents on roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law for transport systems usually includes a range of legal constraints that do not apply to motorways or ordinary roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman believe that the distinction between a transport system and a transport mode seems very fine to the owner-occupier of land who is on the receiving end of the planning system? To him, it does not matter whether an 11-mile motorway or 11-mile railway is built through his land or adjacent to his home. Both will have a material affect on his life. It is therefore sensible that the same planning laws should apply to both those major infrastructure developments. Unless the hon Gentleman establishes a real distinction, I cannot see the point of the group of the amendments, which would spoil the general proposal that the House supported on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. Unfortunately, I was not present on Second Reading, and was unable to make my points then. The hon. Member for Faversham tried to hit the nail on the head but did not succeed. The apparently abstract and irrelevant distinction that I make is more fundamental than he supposes. If I wished to build a railway or waterway that crossed a roadway, a host of matters would have to be considered. They would not apply if I wished to build a new road. Who would maintain a railway bridge? It is not merely a question of right of way. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) will probably comment on that later. To protect a system, a wholly different structure is required. Perhaps that is why the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Sir G. Finsberg) rightly, but in an archaic way, delayed the House on a Bill that was relevant to London Transport or British Rail to make a speech about plans for a single railway bridge in Hampstead. We would all have done that in similar circumstances. I agree with the hon. Member for Faversham that those are not suitable topics for debate on the Floor of the House, but there should be similar procedures elsewhere, with similar protection for those involved. A transport system requires wholly different laws. Let us take policing, for example—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but he should return to schemes of work. I should be grateful if he would confine his remarks to amendment No. 39.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I certainly will. I am not doing well in conveying my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a scheme of work for a railway—for example, the docklands light railway—there is a schedule of noise limits. We build motorways, but we cannot limit the noise. Railways, by their nature, produce noise—they may not do so in the future—so conditions can be imposed. An amendment to the London Docklands Railway Bill stated that it would be constructed only of the trains ran at noise levels below a certain number of decibels. They are running above that level now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the description of works and in the schedule there would be a table of noise limits which would be binding upon the operators of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to the intervention of the hon. Member for Faversham, the county or borough councils are the operators of the roads, the bodies in which the roads are vested. A public or private railway must have its own byelaws, rules and regulations, some of which must be statutory, if only to protect the public who use the system. It is an entirely different range of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) who mentioned the carry-over motion for the King's Cross Railways Bill and suggestions about how to get passengers from King's Cross to Euston. Suddenly, a road was proposed. That will complicate matters because it will involve a different procedure from that suggested by my hon. Friend for the railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I take up his point. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), who chaired the Committee that considered the King's Cross Railways Bill will confirm that at one stage the installation of another transport system was suggested—a travolator between King's Cross and Euston. That is a good example of yet another transport system for which a different type of law specifying protection and powers would have to be devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to schedule 1, if noise levels, maintenance and other matters are not in the description of works, on what basis can the House, the public or anyone else consider how the systems will be operated? At present, we consider whether the company, owner or operator is operating in accordance with the law, especially when there are tragedies. Such matters are discussed on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend explain why it is necessary for these procedures to contain special powers rather being in national legislation? Historically, private Bills have imposed conditions, such as penalty fares. But if such Bills are to be replaced, would it not be more logical, instead of including piecemeal arrangements for penalty fares or safety standards in the transport system, to have national legislation on such matters that is applicable to all railways and tramways? The approach suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) could cause problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that such arrangements should go into the same amount of detail, nor that they should take the legal form to which we are accustomed in private Bills. All that I am suggesting is that they are encompassed, at whatever length is necessary, in a description of works which must conform to the detail
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
laid down in schedule 1. There may be other ways in which to do that, but we shall be in fair trouble if it is not done in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just referred to the docklands light railway. There have been three Bills about that railway, and it has caused a lot of trouble. At this very minute, a Committee down the Corridor is considering petitions about something in the Isle of Dogs known as the mudchute and about houses in Lewisham. I agree that such debates are more suited to planning inquiries. The Bill would require that such inquiries be used so that protection can be given to such things as the mudchute people's park and to houses in Lewisham. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and I do not differ on that matter. But what will happen when we have to deal with the whole length of the Jubilee line from Green Park to Stratford? The line is less than 10 miles long but it will involve difficult matters of public planning such as the layout of the line at, say, Parliament square.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other factors will also come into play, such as those encountered in the complicated legislation on King's Cross. Is the King's Cross Railways Bill to be substituted by a single, negative statutory instrument? I suppose that that is just about conceivable. Perhaps the hon. Member for Faversham can say whether we shall need a London-Channel tunnel railway order, covering the line from King's Cross to Cheriton? Will that one statutory instrument do everything that a Bill would do? If so, we shall need additions such as I have described—legal documents which the several public inquiries that might be held along the railway line in Kent, Essex and inner London would have to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example might be Cardiff bay. Will there be one negative statutory instrument to cover the whole of the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill? The Minister's helpful paper mentions "tidal energy barrages", but when is a barrage a port? When is a port a waterway? Such questions would be decided under the hybridity procedures but they must be taken into consideration. However, Cardiff bay is but a bay in the Severn estuary. Does that mean that in the future there will be a Severn barrage construction and use order 1234/99? I make no complaint about that in principle, but such a negative order would have to encompass everything to do with the construction, use and prejudicial affection of a Severn barrage, including all questions of power, fisheries and flooding. If there were to be such an order, we should adopt my suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that a new railway and tramway age is coming. Will an extension of the great continental railway system from King's Cross to Edinburgh, which many people want, be achieved under one statutory instrument? That is the best example of the extent of authority for which the Bill could provide. I challenge any hon. Member to dispute that, although I doubt that hon. Members have realised what could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why, to return to the remark of the hon. Member for Faversham, amendment No. 39 suggests that the scope of an order should have a limit. I do not propose 10 miles as a firm figure. The figures for railways and tramways could vary; tramways are on a smaller scale than railways. I also do not propose one value. For example, we do not know how many millions of pounds the extension of the Jubilee line to Parliament square will cost, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
perhaps there could be separate statutory instruments for separate parts of the project, appropriate to the value and length of each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause permits the use of the statutory instrument procedure for matters for which it was not originally designed. The statutory instrument procedure was introduced to allow Ministers to use executive powers along lines that everyone agreed were necessary. Examples of such use include the regulation of London taxis, the alteration in figures to uprate for inflation or technical changes and the London-Edinburgh trunk road order. There must be a statutory safeguard so that hon. Members can table a prayer or go to the Committee chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) to ensure that Ministers are not pursuing extra powers. That is the proper and logical use of statutory instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, there has been slippage. Longer statutory instruments containing greater detail are being made. If they are agreeable and necessary, and have been subject to the required consultation, no one would disagree with them. Many years ago I read a book by Sir Ivor Jennings about parliamentary procedure and statutory instruments, written in the middle 1930s. He said that such instruments were being abused by civil servants in getting past the rights and powers of individual Members. However, he pointed out that there was a great safeguard. In cases of the wrong use of statutory instruments, hon. Members could go to the Committee dealing with statutory instruments and could also table a prayer against them. He told of the story of one hon. Member who was getting hot under the collar about a statutory instrument that applied to his constituency. He met the Chief Whip in the Lobby who asked him where he was going. He replied that he was going to inquire from the Table Office how to table a prayer against the London-Holyhead highway order. The Whip said, "Hang on a minute, my dear fellow. Don't do that, please." At that time it was enough to threaten to table a prayer—and expose the Government to criticism on a controversial order—for that order to be at least temporarily withdrawn. We have moved a long way from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By using this method of legislation we are transferring power from the House to the Minister, which may be appropriate, but we must build in requirements on the inquiry procedure so that everything is sorted out before the Minister comes to the House with the order. If not, the Minister, the Government and the law will be brought into disrepute. No one wants to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) has brought many points to our attention. He has covered the Enclosure Acts and cited other early examples of private legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to respond to the amendments. The hon. Gentleman's amendment No. 38 to clause 3, when read in conjunction with the lead amendment No. 33, would create conflicting and incompatible provisions relating to the Secretary of State's order-making powers. The objective of amendment No. 34 appears to be restricted to the Secretary of State's powers to make orders under clause 1 to schemes of work including only those matters listed in schedule 1. That schedule is illustrative rather than exhaustive as it would be impractical to list every matter that would be capable of being dealt with under the order-making powers. I have in mind matters relating to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
novel transport works, where we cannot forecast precisely what should be covered in the order to avoid the need for a private Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 34 would be to increase the likelihood of future schemes coming before Parliament for authorisation. That was not the intention of the Joint Committee that examined the Bill nor the wish of the House on Second Reading. Novel transport systems are being developed. The aim of this Bill is not to exclude private Bills from coming before Parliament and it does not necessarily put that obstacle in their way when perhaps the matter might be better dealt with by a local public inquiry. Some matters will be specifically local and more relevant to an inquiry than to a debate on the Floor of the House. That is why there should be some flexibility in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with the matter straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 would be permissive. The amendment does not say that the schedule must list everything. After the inquiry had been held the inspector might report to the Minister that an agreement had been reached between the promoters and the petitioners on certain matters and that he recommended that it be implemented. The list in schedule 1 would be a minimum requirement—for example, No. 6 might not apply. The list is not designed to be exhaustive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we are trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By tabling amendment No. 39 the hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he wants Parliament to retain its role as the body responsible for authorising all new railway and tramway developments, apart from minor works, such as preserved railway schemes. In other words, he basically wants to preserve the private Bill procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the amendment would do. That is contrary to the views of the Joint Committee whose report and recommendations were widely welcomed by both sides of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 is as confusing as amendment No. 33. The two powers under clause 2 and clause 4 are quite distinct. One relates to the new order-making procedure's application to the types of guided transport other than those named in clause 1. The other relates to the application of the new procedure to different types of work that interfere with the rights of navigation under clause 3. There is no need to confuse those two powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 44, 54, 60, 80 and 81 are consequential on amendment No. 34. The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) said how he would like the procedure to work. The Joint Committee did not propose that we follow that line. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) has clarified or confused the matter. My hon. Friend wanted to establish some safeguards if we go ahead with this drastic change to our parliamentary procedures. I find it surprising that my interpretation of my hon. Friend's comments is so different from that of the Minister. The amendments seek to provide safeguards and clarification of the new procedures. They would satisfy the Committee—and eventually Parliament—that the Government have adopted the recommendations of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure and have modified the recommendations to protect the rights of those affected by any scheme covered by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments go to the heart of the proposed changes. I noted that my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South said that proper discussions should be held before an instrument is laid. He referred to the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which is so ably chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer). When I was first elected to the House more years ago than I care to recollect, that was the first Committee on which I sat, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) and you, Mr. Latham. It is not an experience that I wish to repeat. The fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South has chaired the Committee for so long demonstrates that he has greater stamina than we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be more instruments thanks to clause 1, so my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South will have to be even more diligent in future. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South said that the statutory instrument procedure is often controversial. Certain instruments seem non-controversial, but prove to be the opposite after the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments and my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South have carefully sifted through them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should reconsider his response. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South wanted to clarify the responsibilities that will be placed on the Secretary of State if the clause is not amended. The Minister's response was less than satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the Minister's reaction. He appears entirely to have misunderstood the thrust of my remarks. None of my amendments say that there should be no statutory instrument. I do not challenge the findings of the Select Committee, which were discussed on Second Reading. My amendments seek to make the negative instrument affirmative. That is not a major step; it is an understatement in view of the range of issues that we are considering. It seeks to build into the Bill proper procedures during the period of inquiry which would parallel those implicit in the private Bill procedure and transfer them to the inquiries that take place outside the House, under the aegis of the Department of Transport and the control of the Secretary of State. That can be achieved by listing in schedule 1 the schemes of works, large or small, for any projects which must, by statute, be attended to. The list in schedule 1 is incomplete, especially in respect of environmental and noise matters. If the procedures were carried out efficiently and effectively they would be superior to those of the present, anomalous private Bill procedure. Inquiries could be held where they mattered, with the full and proper protection for petitioners or objectors that is generally found in public planning procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 39, which relates to the 10-mile rule, seeks to remove substantial schemes from the order-making powers. The amendment would alter the basic philosophy of the Bill, although that may not be the intention of the amendment. Many issues that should be considered under the planning procedure would, in effect, come before the House and little would be gained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Faversham. I plead guilty to the accusation that my remarks, lengthy though they were, were not long enough to put the point clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of the effect of amendment No. 39. Let us take a London-channel rail company; the Secretaries of State for Transport and the Environment have said that that is Government policy so it is an actual, not a hypothetical example. If the House says, "No order shall be made for any work estimated by the Minister to exceed £10 million," there would be one order for King's Cross, one for the east London route from King's Cross to Stratford, one for the complex projects surrounding Stratford—I shall not enlarge on that for reasons which anyone who knows Stratford and channel tunnel stations will understand—one for the route from the channel tunnel to the Thames river crossing and so on. There would be separate public inquiries for each part of the route, but when they came before the House, several orders could be taken together, as the hon. Member for Faversham will appreciate. To enable the inquiries to be analysed properly and to be coherent, they would be grouped so that they did not exceed a specific length or value. The amendment would enable the procedure outside to work better than it would under the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments outline the same procedure as is adopted for motorway construction. There was no public inquiry into the construction of the M62 from Liverpool to Hull. A series of local inquiries took place, along the lines proposed in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that a Select Committee considered the channel tunnel Bill. I could not follow the proceedings as closely as I wished. However, I remember that the Committee adjourned to Folkestone and took evidence from its good citizens about the tunnel's effect on the area. Perhaps the Select Committee should have visited Maidstone too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the convenience of the petitioners, and everyone else, a line of waterway or tramway should be set up by the relevant Department, and Parliament could then state that one order would cover only one chunk. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) for making the motorway analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments are not accepted, the Bill may lead to negative instruments such as a Severn barrage construction and use Order. Does the Minister deny that the Bill, as drafted, would enable that to happen? Will he say yes or no? Silence breeds assent. The House should not accept the Bill without amendment. However, I do not wish to press the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must deal with some mountainous issues, which may not have come to the public's notice or to that of some hon. Members. The hon. Member for Faversham misunderstood what I said. That emphasises that our proceedings are at a preliminary stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case the hon. Gentleman believes that silence always breeds assent, I wish to challenge the idea that longer speeches necessarily clarify matters. Issues become clearer in shorter speeches. The hon. Gentleman is technically wrong. The amendments would not achieve the hon. Gentleman's objective. If the amendments were accepted, we would revert to current procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This ruling is not directed at any specific intervention. I remind members of the Committee that there is no limit on the number of times that hon. Members speak. Long interventions are to be regretted and, I hope, avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure hon. Members that, as I have made an introductory statement, my subsequent contributions will be briefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) did not believe that my words were directed at him or any other member of the Committee. It was a general observation to facilitate the proceedings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks were directed at the general comments of the hon. Member for Faversham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the London-channel tunnel order, which could affect the constituency of the hon. Member for Faversham. Would he deem it appropriate for an inquiry into that part of the railway, which could run more than 10 miles through northern Kent, to be conducted in Church house, Westminster and for the same inspector to cover the whole route. That could take a year or more. Would it not be preferable for a public inquiry to take place in Faversham or Sittingbourne, where a possible London-channel tunnel railway (Medway-Thanet) order could be discussed? His constituents could get a hearing from the inspector about the route's details in a way that would not be so practical at Church house. It would not only be better for the hon. Member for Faversham and his constituents, it would help the reputation of the House, the Committee and the Minister if some such formula were inserted in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the Select Committee that considered the channel tunnel. I was a member of that Committee and we held local hearings, such as amendment No. 34 proposes. Those hearings were very much appreciated by people who did not want the trouble and expense of travelling to London. They much preferred to give evidence in a more familiar environment than the House of Commons or Church house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He has illustrated the point that I have been making. I hope that the Minister will withdraw his remarks. I do not think that the inhibiting atmosphere of private Bill Committees, with their wigs, gowns and court-like ambience, is appropriate for matters that could be dealt with in local public inquiries in place such as Faversham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposal is that we should use the procedure that the Select Committee and the House want. I am prepared to set aside my constitutional doubts about the use of the statutory instrument trigger mechanism, but a change of procedure will not happen unless something similar to my amendment is included in the Bill. I know that Ministers would prefer to do everything in one process, and they have the powers to ensure that that is what happens. I think that the Committee is beginning to understand what I am talking about and I hope that that understanding will develop as our deliberations proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with a few particular points. First, it is not necessary to split the orders. The Secretary of State's original order may specify that local points may be made. Secondly, the person chairing the public inquiry is entitled to decide that, if necessary, an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
inquiry should move to another area to examine conditions there. Some of what the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) has suggested would be possible, but some would not. For instance, it is not possible to split orders relating to railway junctions, which are not so easy to change as road junctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Environmental and noise assessments will be covered by the rules to be made under clause 6. That will go some way towards answering the questions raised about such matters. However, I should point out to the hon. Member for Newham, South that schedule 1 is by no means an exhaustive list. I did not understand all of his initial argument, but I hope that I have allayed some of his fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's response, but I do not see the word "noise" anywhere in clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant that that could be dealt with in the rules that will be made under that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but those rules will be made by the Minister; they should be made by the House. We are involved in legislation and the Minsiter should not have carte blanche. A great deal of power is being transferred to the Executive. The Minister has just admitted as much. My contention is that noise provisions should be included in the Bill or in the consolidated list at the end, but the Minister has refused. That is startling. Perhaps he did not understand what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, I should like the Minister to withdraw what he said about the thrust of our amendments. They are not designed to retain the private Bill procedure, they would do the reverse. They spell out an alternative procedure, and I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that before I make my closing remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to offend the hon. Gentleman, but some parts of the amendments would get us back to the private Bill procedure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) pointed out. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that some of the main points that he wishes to cover are already dealt with in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the opinion of the Minister, not that of the Committee. I shall not rehearse now some of the protections in the outdated private Bill procedure. However, as we seem to be making a little progress in protecting the person, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 1, line 17, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 27, in page 1, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) Before laying any instrument under subsection (2) above, the Secretary of State shall lay before both Houses of Parliament his proposals for such an instrument, such proposals shall be subject to amendment by either House, and any such amendment shall be reflected in the instrument.'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 38, in clause 3, page 2, line 15, at end add 'approved by Resolution of both Houses of Parliament'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My amendment is extremely modest, as the Committee would expect. It is tabled in reply to the breathtaking effrontery of the Minister and his Department in seeking to obtain powers that are not subject to any parliamentary procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
We accepted the principle of the Bill, but when I saw that so many clauses state that the powers shall be exercised by statutory instrument, I could scarcely believe it. Despite the scrutiny of hon. Members on the Floor of the House and in the other place—Lord Rippon spoke on the matter—the Government seek to take powers in a breathtaking manner. Ministers' powers are being increased week by week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the notes on clauses from the Department of Transport. Paragraph 7 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of regulation 4 of the Statutory Instruments Regulations 1947 orders would be classified as local instruments; they would not attract any Parliamentary procedure other than in the circumstances where Clause 9 or Clause 12 would apply. Administrative arrangements will be made with the Statutory Publications Office to provide for the publication of orders in the annual edition of Statutory Instruments."</p></blockquote>
I thank the Department very much. It is bound to do that, anyhow. The Department is telling us that it will do what it is bound to do, as though it is a grace-and-favour concession given by the Department to Members of the House. Members of Parliament are elected and do not take kindly to being patronised by Government Departments telling them that the Department will do what it has to do anyhow. It is absolutely disgraceful that the Department is proposing, by administrative fiat, to produce orders that exercise several powers listed in schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Secretary of State issue a statutory instrument containing criminal penalties with sanctions of either fines or imprisonment? The powers in schedule 1(12) cover
	<br><blockquote><p>"The charging of tolls, fares (including penalty fares) and other charges, and the creation of summary offences in connection with non-payment (or in connection with a person's failure to give his name or address in accordance with provisions relating to penalty fares)."</p></blockquote>
Those are not civil matters, but criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of the construction of an embankment or creating or extinguishing rights over land, including the rights of navigation over water, whether compulsorily or by agreement—it is a criminal sanction. Yet the Department proposes that those sanctions be exercisable by statutory instruments, which are not subject to parliamentary procedure. There will be no prayer and no resolution of affirmative support or criticism. There will be no paltry hour or hour and a half for a prayer, which is the height of parliamentary scrutiny for statutory instruments. There will be nothing, except for notification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not good enough. The entire procedure for scrutiny of statutory instruments by the House is not good enough. We must try to roll back the administrative tide that has been sweeping through the House for the past quarter century and more. That is why amendment No. 32 would add that the statutory instrument
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
A later amendment to clause 3 would move a negative procedure instrument to an affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proposing simply to move the process whereby the Secretary of State makes a statutory instrument and that is the end of the matter, into the existing procedure, so that we have some right of scrutiny of statutory instruments. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) would go even further. He wants an amendable statutory instrument, which is an excellent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
idea. Therefore, there is a choice of the affirmative, amendable statutory instrument or the existing procedure of a negative instrument that enables a prayer to be tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not asking for much. A negative procedure instrument
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament"</p></blockquote>
is not a great power handed to elected Members of Parliament. If a Member of Parliament wants to oppose a negative procedure instrument, he or she must invoke the support of the Front Bench to get time to debate the instrument on the Floor of the House. If a group of Members table a prayer, the likelihood of the Government providing time is slim. The ordinary Back Bencher does not have much impact when dealing with such delegated powers; the Front Bench must be invoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens then? In their zest for parliamentary accountability, will the Government immediately provide time so that the prayer can be debated? Prayers can be tabled only during the 40 days when instruments are laid before Parliament. The instrument can often come into effect and the 40 laying days elapse so that a revocation motion must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a prayer on the health and safety—SI 1991 No. 15/31—currently on the Order Paper. The Front Bench of the Labour party is listed as opposing it, and in the previous Session of Parliament it was opposed by a group of Conservative Back Benchers. It has still not been allocated time for debate although it affects important lobbies, such as the shooting lobby which has made many representations. That prayer has been listed for about two and a half months, but still has not been debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking not for a right of veto—a scheme under which Members can confront and overthrow the Minister —but for a scheme such as Parliament has used for many years under which, with a great deal of effort and indulgence by the Government, a prayer against an instrument can be debated. A full one and a half hours debate would not necessarily be granted if there were a vote at 10 o'clock. A prayer usually has to finish at 11.30 pm. One or two votes would remove 25 minutes from the time allowed for the prayer. In the worst possible circumstances, the debate could be 1 hour 5 minutes. That is not much to ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Except for the most trivial matters, such as bringing an Act into operation, the House should abandon the system by which statutory instruments introduced by Ministers are not subject to parliamentary procedure. Clause 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make an order relating to, or to matters ancillary to, the construction or operation of a transport system of any of the following".</p></blockquote>
A list follows. A construction or operation could mean level crossings, points, safety on a railway, and so on. They are important matters and the Secretary of State and his advisers may not get it right. These important powers should be a matter for parliamentary scrutiny. In usual circumstances, few prayers are debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prayer is a stopgap, and not a very adequate one, but without the right to table a prayer, Members would be unable to do anything about such powers. It is outrageous that Parliament should be prepared to hand them to the Minister when so many issues are involved. The acquisition of land, whether compulsorily or by agreement, should be a matter for the House. There may be associated public inquiries and, as the notes on clauses
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
made clear, planning consent must be given. But planning consent is often judged by what the Government do. In Bradford, it was said that Ministers gave a nod and a wink to planning consent for a factory in the green belt because it would be approved by the Department of the Environment if it was approved by the local authority. Planning consent was given by a hint, so I am told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power and persuasion of Government is an important element in the issue. Parliament is a repository for the civil rights and liberties of individual citizens. Members of Parliament have the opportunity to raise issues and to defend those rights and liberties. It may not always work, but at least they have that opportunity. However, there will be no such opportunity if anything goes wrong in a procedure or planning application or if there is an injustice under the powers in schedule 1. If something goes wrong, the right of Members of Parliament to table a prayer and to force a debate will have been removed. It is an important control on Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk, much of it fiction, about House of Commons control of the Executive. Some people say that Parliament is a terrible, noisy place. We are not all just sitting there looking good. We sometimes shout and sometimes intervene and embarrass Ministers. That is good. If a Minister has to come to a noisy assembly in which there are no limitations, we do not have to be good all the time as they are in some other assemblies. Nobody speaks in the French National Assembly. It is a great deal easier for a Minister to make a case in an assembly which is well mannered than in a noisy place like the House of Commons. It is all part of that element of accountability. When a Minister comes to the House, he knows that he has a potentially difficult time ahead if his case is weak and he must ensure that he knows his ground. The whole process is abstruse, obscure and little used. It would be outrageous, except for the most trivial matters, if a Minister did not have to refer to Parliament. I have a bee in my bonnet about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, Parliament took little notice of statutory instruments. Extremely unusually, in 1929 the Lord Chancellor of the day, Lord Hewart, wrote a book entitled "The New Despotism". His book said that too many powers were being given to Ministers and that they could exercise them in an arbitrary and undemocratic manner —hence the title. That book had an effect on Parliament, which thought that there was much in what the Lord Chancellor said. Lord Hewart was not a raging left-winger. On the contrary, he was a right-winger who argued that the Executive should not become too powerful. Both right and left wings should bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changes were made, and when Ministers made further errors, the system of scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments was introduced. The Committees do not have the power to examine the merits of a policy, and they cannot challenge what Ministers do on that basis, but if Ministers make unusual use of power of if the Minister is ultra vires or the instrument is ambiguous, the Joint and Select Committee have power to report him to the House of Commons. The House of Commons does not take much notice of our reports, but at least they are there for people to use if they choose the route of the courts to challenge an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not depend on the courts to clarify legislation. People use our legislation and it is our duty to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
make it as clear as possible. Statutory instruments and delegated legislation give me cause for concern. From time to time, I have enjoyed chairing the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. We provide a useful service. The Minister is aware that sometimes his civil servants will produce a draft instrument and ask counsel to the Joint Commitee for an opinion. They will be told, for example, that they have made a mess of clause 3, and they will redraft it before the instrument is laid before Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, instruments do not reach Parliament because they have to be redrafted. Occasionally, counsel finds that an affirmative instrument is badly drafted. It is then withdrawn, redrafted and relaid before the House. If instruments were not subject to parliamentary procedure, that largely hidden area of scrutiny would be completely removed. The Joint Committee would not have to be consulted. Sometimes instruments that are not subject to parliamentary procedure are presented before the Joint Committee because we request it and want to exercise that degree of scrutiny—but we can do nothing about them. If they are flawed, we cannot report them to Parliament and expect someone to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is accepted unamended, another safeguard will be thrown out of the window. If the Department makes a mistake when preparing an instrument, which will be used by people outside the House, another order will have to be laid before the House or the original order will lie fallow until an amending opportunity occurs later. If an instrument is presented before the Joint Committee, the prayer will be better formed. Powerful arguments exist for invoking negative procedure instruments rather than the statutory instrument procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled amendments to every clause where the Minister has invoked only the statutory instrument procedure. I hope that the Minister will undertake to scrap entirely the procedure to invoke only statutory instruments. I accept that the procedure for transport work should improve on the private Bill procedure. I do not attack the principle of the Bill. The private Bill procedure meant that we were inundated with opportunities to discuss Bills. The Private Bill Select Committee enabled us to spend hours examining measures. We spent hours doing that because the gents in wigs were paid by the hour and they spoke slowly to ensure that they had their daily refreshers, which stimulated even slower speech on the following day and the day after. However, we should not move from that to a procedure whereby power is handed over to the Minister without parliamentary scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that my hon. Friend makes about prayers. However, considering the clamour for shorter hours in the House, does my hon. Friend believe that the Government will use that to ensure that even fewer prayers are debated on the Floor of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a good point on a separate but related issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is a member of the Select Committee on Sittings of the House. He and I have different views about the matter. The Leader of the House attended the Committee and said that ten-minute Bills could be waived and business questions curtailed. They are all valuable opportunities for Back Benchers to raise issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The Government should not believe that everything about statutory instruments is satisfactory because it is not. Parliament should provide more time to debate statutory instruments because that is sorely needed. In one or two court cases on social security statutory instruments the vires have been successfully challenged. I do not like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fault of Parliament, of parliamentary draftsmen and of the Departments involved if instruments are challenged as a result of their technical deficiencies. There should be more scrutiny. There should be no opportunity to curtail the hours of Parliament if we are to do our job properly and consider the merits, as distinct from the technicalities, of an instrument. They are important, but they are never subject to debate unless there is a debate on the merits of the instrument. More, not less, time is needed. I am opposed to handing to a Minister powers that will require no further reference to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will not draft the instrument himself; it will be compiled by civil servants and sent to him. In response to questions from the Minister such as, "Is clause 3 adequate?", two or three people will telephone his private office and say, "Can we come and see the Minister about section D—the bridge section?" They will then subject him to two or three hours of explanation and, at the end of the day, a weary and beaten Minister will sign the order. Much of the power is transferred not to the Minister but to the apparatus within the Department. That is less than satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with almost all that the hon. Gentleman says. Does he agree that there is some recourse, because after publication of a decision it can be challenged in the High Court? I believe that that must be done within six weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right, but the longstop should not be the court. It is extremely expensive to go to court; it is beyond the reach of most citizens. One may have to pay for an injunction or an order to prevent or to require a Minister to carry out an order of mandamus, for example, or to carry out his duty under an Act. We should not consider the courts as a longstop. Use by the citizen is the basic criterion on which we should judge delegated and primary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The private Bill procedure is like a court procedure. People who come to petition or to be cross-examined feel that they are in a court. An argument for the new proposals is that they move away from that. We do not want to return to a more clearly defined court procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The private Bill procedure is also extremely expensive and less than adequate. To promote a private Bill, it is usual to invoke parliamentary agents. Some of my acquaintances who work for a local authority saw parliamentary agents for one hour one afternoon and it cost the local authority £500. It is outrageous that there is such an oligopoly linked to Parliament. I made that absolutely clear, but I shall repeat it so that the Minister cannot claim that I am opposed to the principle of the Bill. I am in favour of diminishing the private Bill procedure so that a better procedure can be instituted. However, I do not support handing matters over for operation and administration by Ministers and their civil servants without any parliamentary involvement—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Whip, Mr. Latham. He is plotting, or something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall illustrate my contention that matters should not be left to Ministers and civil servants by recalling the argument that took place over the Rolvenden and Tenterden railway, which was the subject of a light railway order. The then Minister and her civil servants decided that it would be dangerous for trains to cross a level crossing over a trunk road. A railway preservation society, which now operates a successful light railway, had British Rail's permission to use the level crossing for a series of works trains. However, the Minister decided to stand firm on her civil servants' advice that the crossing was dangerous because cars could zoom down the A-road slap into the side of a six-coupled tank engine. The Minister said that it had to be ensured that trains could not cross the level crossing at all, so the railway preservation society was forced to chain the wheels of the locomotive and rolling stock to the track and to close and chain the locomotive's regulators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows how arbitrary Ministers and their civil servants can be. I would hesitate to give them more power and, in effect, to take away the more open system of the light railway orders, especially as in that case the Minister and the civil servants were wrong. The railway between Tenterden and Rolvenden and further to Robertsbridge has operated with complete safety and success. It is a valuable route that has given great pleasure to passengers and operators alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must always be careful about arbitrary ministerial power. We are assured that, of course no Minister would exercise power in an arbitrary fashion, and the Minister is smiling his nice smile to prove that that is true. However, the danger is that all sorts of things can happen when the Minister disappears into the Department of Transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to reflect that no such accusation could ever have been levelled against my hon. Friend when he was a distinguished Minister in the previous Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I was never accused of exercising power arbitrarily because the then Secretary of State was cautious about giving me any power at all. I cannot imagine why, unless he thought that I might have put more enterprises into public ownership than was then the policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Ministers should be subject to parliamentary accountability. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that he will, at the very least, accept my amendment. I do not wish to pre-empt my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, and I shall willingly withdraw my amendment if the Minister accepts his amendment, but an adventurous course would be to accept an amendable instument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point that I have not made is that we are faced with statutory instruments and we must take them or leave them. We cannot amend them; they are not subject to any process of improvement. It is all or nothing. When a prayer is tabled, it is to reject an instrument. When the House considers an affirmative instrument, it either approves or rejects it. Perfectly adequate instruments may contain an offensive clause or sub-clause, but we can do nothing about it. However, an area of legislation governing the census allows an amendable instrument to be tabled, and I concur with the views of my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
the Member for Denton and Reddish that that would be a good system on which to embark Why not use the opportunity provided by the Bill, which replaces a system considered by many to be outmoded and unsatisfactory, to be innovative? That is what entrepreneurs are supposed to be. We should be innovative, far-sighted and all the other jargonistic claptrap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not necessarily remain staid in our ways. The Bill gives powers to the Minister, but why not share them, to some degree, with Parliament in this fairly narrowly defined area by allowing some amendments to orders when they are tabled? That is a good idea. If the Minister wants to think about it, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish will be happy to give him time to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a range of options, all of which would improve democratic accountability. If the Bill is not amended, there will be no democratic accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that at present there is no limit to the number of paragraphs in a statutory instrument? If there is not, could there be a 300-paragraph instrument for the channel tunnel railway, for example, which the House, even if a prayer were tabled, would either have to accept or have no railway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister designated the statutory instrument as dealing with a work of national importance, a slightly different procedure would be invoked. However, there is no limitation on the length of a statutory instrument. Indeed, some statutory instruments that come before the Joint Committee are two or three inches thick. I do not think that hon, Members realise the effrontery behind generating a pile of papers—some statutory instruments cost £20 or £30 and contain 100 paragraphs. That would not disgrace primary legislation. Many statutory instruments are voluminous. They contain basic legislation, schedules and examples of the way that calculations should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South is right to say that the idea that statutory instruments are necessarily brief, clear documents, which can be easily absorbed, is not true. If we do not amend the Bill, we shall hand over to the Minister power to produce a statutory instrument that may contain 50 paragraphs, tables schedules, diagrams and calculations without reference to Parliament. I apologise to the Committee for not bringing examples of statutory instruments with me so that hon. Members realise what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have persuaded hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that something better should be done. I hope that the Minister will accept one of the interesting alternatives before him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South and hope that the Minister looks sympathetically on his amendment No. 32 and my amendment No. 27. It is a laudable principle to hand over power on private Bills from Parliament to people in the communities. However, I am unhappy with notion of handing over power from Parliament to the Secretary of State. The danger with the Bill is that it seems to be transferring power to the Secretary of State instead of to ordinary people. The Secretary of State will have the power to decide whether a scheme is of local or national significance. At some point during our proceedings, we must design an effective check on how he makes that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
We must also come up with a way in which it is possible for Parliament to express a view that is amendable. The issues are not necessarily black and white in many of these schemes; it is a question of having not just A, but A, B or C. Therefore, the procedure must retain for Parliament the opportunity for giving general guidance, which may be an amendment to an instrument or an instruction. Under the private Bill procedure there is an opportunity to put down an instruction. If we are to transfer power to people outside, we must try to avoid leaving such power with the Secretary of State. That is what worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power for the Secretary of State to make an order that is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny is unsatisfactory. It may be that in 99 per cent. of cases, orders will be laid and will go through without a prayer. However, there should be an automatic opportunity for a debate in Parliament for that small number of cases when there is anxiety outside or when it is felt that the Secretary of State is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South was worried that prayers are difficult to table. He must remember George Cunningham, who managed always to ensure that a prayer in his name was debated. It is possible to cause the Government sufficient annoyance that sooner or later, if a Member forces too many votes at inconvenient times, they will agree to a debate. Therefore, a debate, even on a prayer, is still an effective power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must look further and to the possibilities for amendments. It is always possible for a group of Members from both sides of a Committee to gang up on the Minister and force through a particular amendment. I had the impression that when we debated alcohol limits, there might have been sufficient agreement to have pressed the Minister further. I am not sure whether that sort of undercurrent is developing in this Committee, but it is possible to focus the attention of hon. Members on one amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with a statutory instrument is that there is no opportunity to focus attention on one element; it has to be all or nothing. At the moment, the Secretary of State can have all of it, without scrutiny. If my hon. Friend's amendment were accepted, there would at least be some scrutiny, but it would still be all or nothing. Hon. Members should have the opportunity to focus on one part, about which everybody may be unhappy, and to be able to force acceptance of an amendment to remove that part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, will he tell us how he will decide whether schemes are of national or local significance? I understand that plans are well afoot to put a barrage across the Mersey for a power scheme. It can be argued that as part of the north-west of England, the Mersey has regional significance only. However, it can be argued also that the scheme has national significance because of the power to be generated. Moreover, it can be argued that the possible loss of habitat for birds is of international significance. Would the Minister consider such a scheme to be national or local?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a scheme were considered to be national, would it be amendable so that there could be a clear instruction to Parliament to examine it, to limit the tidal range so that there would always be mudflats on the Mersey to protect the birds, and to ensure that there could always be a road across the top of the barrage? What are the Minister's views on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Greater Manchester is building a system of trams that will take it back to its position in 1945. However, to do that some railways must be closed. One discussion has been about bringing a tramway out into the Tameside part of my constituency, which could involve the closure of one of British Rail's lines. Would that be of national or local significance? Locally, it could improve the transport system for many of my constituents who travel to Manchester. Nationally, on the rare occasions when the line from Stoke northwards through Stockport is closed after an accident, for example, there would be far fewer opportunities for diverting the trains. How far would it be possible for Parliament to give an instruction that a light rapid transport system could be built out into my constituency, but not at the expense of closing a British Rail line?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier I referred to the King's Cross Railways Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) argued then that it would be reasonable to have a station at King's Cross, but that it should be a surface station of national importance as a channel tunnel terminal with links to the north of England, rather than a property development with a station stuck away somewhere in the basement. Parliament should be able to take a view on such an issue and, if necessary, table an amendment for the station to be on the surface rather than underground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to transfer power from Parliament to people outside and to ensure that the power does not stop with the Secretary of State. How can we challenge the Secretary of State's decision on whether a scheme is of local or national significance? As part of that challenging mechanism, will it be possible for Parliament to table amendments to statutory instruments that can identify a particular area about which we are especially worried and focus people's attention on altering one section while accepting the general principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) in his forceful speech. He said that safety would not be subject to the annulment order, but he is wrong. Clauses 42 and 44 make safety issues a matter for the annulment procedure. He was worried about the criminality aspect of the increase in penalties in clause 5. Those penalties are at level 3 and amount to £400. That is no different from many other powers in byelaws, which are subject to affirmation by Ministers. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's anxieties on two of the issues that he raised. I shall speak about the general issues in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) asked which schemes would be of national significance. He went some way to explain why it was not possible to bring forward a set of proposals to say what would be judged as schemes of national significance, and that if they met that criteria they would follow the procedures outlined later in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman outlined the position relating to the Manchester metro, asking whether a line might be closed down that may for all practical purposes be of local interest but which might have national implications. That is one reason why we are not yet convinced of the need to introduce a schedule specifying what should be designated of national significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing for a schedule to specify that one scheme should be national and one local. I am asking for procedures so that we can challenge the Minister's apparently unilateral decision-making powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The hon. Gentleman does not need advice from me on what he can do to challenge a Minister's decision whether a particular scheme falls within the category of national significance. I am not best qualified to advise the hon. Gentleman on tactics, although he might be able to advise me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is promoting the Bill. It should contain a mechanism for that challenge. I can think of many ways of disrupting Parliament, but I should not have to do so. There should be an orderly mechanism for the purpose of challenge. Is the Minsiter telling me to go down to the Floor of the House, to make a fuss and to table bogus points of order? A responsible Minister should offer me a constitutional way to challenge his decision on whether something is of national or local significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, the Bill states that the relevant Minister will decide whether a scheme is of national significance. When that is decided, the course of action outlined in the Bill will be followed. That is the present understanding of the Bill, partly because of the difficulties involved in saying which schemes should go into which category, as I explained earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has that ultimate decision, who does he consider he should consult before that decision is taken? Will he consult the local authorities or the communities involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of being sidetracked on to an issue that I am sure we shall discuss at length later in Committee, as it has already provoked interest. Overall, very few schemes will follow that particular line. A number of the schemes that we are discussing will naturally assume local significance. The ones that are of national significance, to which the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish referred—the channel tunnel links for example—will obviously be schemes of national significance, and that procedure will be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no way of knowing how the Minister will decide what will be of national significance. The Minister mentioned the channel tunnel in that respect, but it would be helpful if he could give us some further idea of the sort of scheme that he will consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned some of the difficulties. Some aspects that will be seen to be of local importance will be found to have wider implications and may therefore fall under the other procedure. I cannot specify those as such in the schedule, but we shall discuss it in far greater detail in clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want to curtail discussion; it is neither within my power nor desirable to do that. I remind the Committee that a specific clause tackles that subject. I am sure that hon. Members will bear that in mind when they intervene on the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I help the Minister to decide what is national and what is local? Perhaps he should import from the European Community the principle of subsidiarity, as soon as someone within the EC has worked out what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, the hon. Gentleman has carried the hon. Member for Bradford, South with him. However, I doubt whether the hon. Member for Bradford, South supported his last suggestion because he does not even believe that courts should be able to interpret the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not exclude courts. However, if a matter has to go to court, either the primary or the subordinate legislation must be defective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman made that point. I apologise if I misrepresented it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can conclude the matter— especially as you, Mr. Latham, have pointed out that we shall be able to discuss it under clause 9. However, I remind the Minister that amendment No. 65 bears on the matter. Does he recall that a Bill that authorised a simple wharf or port in the Trent had national significance? The point is, therefore, very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bear in mind what the hon. Member has said. However, I shall bear your strictures in mind, Mr. Latham, and return to the issue when we discuss clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Bradford, South, for Denton and Reddish and for Newham, South. The amendments are unsatisfactory. Under the annulment procedure, only one hon. Member would need to pray against the proposals for them to be debated. Under affirmative procedure, every order would have to be debated in both Houses. That places an extra obstacle in the way of the procedure for private Bills. One of the main recommendations of the Joint Committee was to allow local matters to be discussed in a local public inquiry. There are well-established procedures outside Parliament for authorising road schemes and planning developments. The private Bill procedure does not cover that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that if a local authority wishes to designate a gipsy camp site, it has to obtain an order, which is subject to annulment? Such an issue is important to a local community, but has no national significance; yet an hon. Member who feels strongly about it could pray against that order. Surely hon. Members should have the opportunity to pray against orders relating to transport. Hon. Members would probably use that opportunity rarely, but that safeguard should exist. An hon. Member should have the right to raise an issue that is relevant to his or her constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that most of those points would be tackled vociferously at the public inquiry stage. We are not attempting to remove from local people and authorities the right to present their case. Some parts of the Bill go some way to extend the powers of those who can make representations. A locus standi appears in private legislation that does not appear in the regulations that apply to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to the rights of petitioners—people who state that they wish their views to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
be considered, and who then depend on the authorities to decide whether to accept those views. Those are not the same rights as those of legislators, who want to be able to say that a matter should come before the House and be subject to amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. However, it is unclear how such an amendment would work. If it were accepted, Parliament could not have an important debate, unless the details of a scheme, the plans, the environmental statement and the inspector's report were made available after a local inquiry. That would be bound to prolong the decision-making process and involve the promoters in substantial additional costs. The hon. Member for Bradford, South may say that those costs should not worry the Committee, but I would not want various schemes to be stopped because other schemes cost huge amounts of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an amendment was carried in the other place, the order would be lost—possibly on a single vote. Such a procedure would provide uncertainty for promoters and it would be disincentive to railway and tramway developments. I doubt whether any hon. Members would wish to place greater obstacles in the path of public transport developments than already apply to highway schemes. The amendment is too over-regulatory and would lead to too many questions about what are likely to be local schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just heard the most outrageous jumble of arguments that I have ever heard—even in this place—about a simple and straightforward procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that I would not care about the cost. He has to lay an order before Parliament under other parts of the Bill, so that negates his argument. An order has to be laid before Parliament for 40 days, and there is the possibility that some hon. Members may be concerned about some aspect and wish to pray against it. It is not true that that would, of necessity, delay the order. Some orders have been made that come into operation as soon as they are laid. The notion that parliamentary procedures are followed scrupulously is simply not true. I cannot see that the switch from a cumbersome and expensive private Bill procedure to the tabling of a simple order is similar in terms of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
We are talking about a relatively small period of time. If the Minister is worried about delays to a scheme, it is up to him whether a prayer is heard in Parliament. All he has to say to the Chief Whip when he attends a Cabinet Committee to discuss a scheme is, "Look Charlie, or Jack. This is a matter of some importance. Can we slot in this hour and half as soon as possible after 10 o'clock?" The Chief Whip, who is not inundated with prayers or orders, says, "Next week, Patrick. We can do it at the drop of a hat." The notion that this procedure will be expensive does not bear examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister failed to answer some of the points that I made in my plea for parliamentary accountability. I simply ask that hon. Members have the right to put down a prayer on relatively important matters. The number of prayers that are tabled in relation to the number of orders is minuscule. I shall cite the figures for the Committee because we shall have further discussions about statutory instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister know that about 1,500 instruments are subject to parliamentary procedure each year? The Conservative Government have produced more statutory instruments than the previous Labour Government, so the Government who were elected to remove legislation from the backs of the people have produced much greater quantities of it. The number of negative procedure instruments that are subject to debate and prayer is well under 10 per cent.—a tiny proportion. The Minister argues that there might be some infinitesimal risk that some hon. Members may face a problem in their constituency or region, or be confronted with a national problem, and might exercise their democratic rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, on questions of safety, clauses 42 and 44 require instruments to be made under the negative procedure. Clause 42(3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations … may … dispense (conditionally or unconditionally) with compliance with regulations that would otherwise apply".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
