VALUATIONS FOR PURPOSES OF LISTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [27 November]:</i> No. 199, in page 13, line 12, after "valuations", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"referred to in subsection 1(a) above".—[<i>Mr. McAvoy.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing amendment No. 200, in page 13, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Without prejudice to their powers in subsection (1) above, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall carry out general revaluations of dwellings in England and Wales.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2B) The revaluations referred to in subsection 1(aa) above shall be carried out by reference to such date as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last night we began to consider banding, and especially the stability of property prices. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) moved the amendment and suggested that the instability of property prices will fundamentally undermine the banding process. The Government referred to the poll tax in their consultation paper on the council tax and acknowledged:
<br><blockquote><p>"The public have not been persuaded that the scheme is fair."</p></blockquote>
If that was true of the poll tax, it is also true of the council tax. People need to be persuaded that it is a fair system and that the basis on which the tax is levied is fair. They must be convinced, therefore, that property valuation is fair.<br><br>
I carried out a survey in my constituency. Someone who tried to sell a flat in Leeds went to three local estate agents for three valuations in the same week. The estate agents valued the flat at £37,400, £42,000 and £47,000. There is a difference of almost £10,000 between the highest and lowest valuation. Prices are lower in the north of England than they are in the south. However, those prices cross two of the bands in the proposed system. Band A applies to properties that are valued at less than £40,000; Band B covers properties that are valued from £40,000 to £52,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point. What valuation would the flat receive under "Fair Rates"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You tell me. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"]<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
The banding system is the property equivalent of the exchange rate mechanism. The Minister is wrong to believe that the banding system will control property prices. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Maybe I should shout. The Minister is keen to ask questions but not to answer them. He deflects questions and does not answer them. How will the banding system prevent fluctuations in property prices? Property valuations will not fluctuate within one band. Revaluations will not be limited within the range of bands set out in the Bill. The Minister could not guarantee that there would be no revaluations in perpetuity. Why does he believe that revaluations will be confined within bands? That is palpably wrong. The banding system will not act as a brake on the change in property prices.<br><br>
The property prices do not only increase. Prices also decrease as they have done in the south of England. The Government promote the idea that the value of shares always increases, but they have to include a notice at the bottom of application forms to state that shares occasionally decrease in value. The illusion that there is a continuum and a regular increase cannot be supported in practice. Property prices are incredibly unstable, varying between regions, different types of property and even between boroughs in the London area. The Government must take that into account in their banding proposals.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Minister is familiar with all the information that is available. Has he examined the research commissioned by the Association of London Authorities from the London Research Centre? That work challenged the view that there would not be a need for constant revaluation. What is the Minister's response to that research? It is likely that the council tax valuations will fail to reflect changes in relative property prices. That will lead to a massive number of appeals and to pressure for a regular valuation.<br><br>
I cited the Leeds case, and it is obvious that people allocated to a band will run and ask for a revaluation because they do not agree with the original valuation. The system will lead inevitably to appeal after appeal as people try to reduce their bill by shifting between the bands. Will the Minister say how he will prevent that? Will the system be clogged up with appeals for ever, or will he concede that our proposal of a regular valuation must be adopted? At present, the valuations are likely to be carried out in a cursory manner. Earlier in our proceedings the Minister spoke flippantly about aerial surveillance. However, people will not accept valuations that are based on brief external examinations and are more than likely to appeal.<br><br>
The Government must accept that it is wrong to say that regular revaluations will not be necessary. The Minister should acknowledge that the phrase "in perpetuity" will not retain its usual meaning and that regular revaluation will be required. Many people will believe that their properties have been assigned to the wrong band. Their appeals against the valuation will clog up the process, and will mean that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
local authorities will not be able to collect the money owed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government's notion of time scales is often at odds with other people's. As late as October 1983, the Government were saying that the rating system would be the source of local government finance for the foreseeable future. They published the poll tax Green Paper in 1985. When the poll tax was being debated, they said that it would last for years and years, so perhaps we can be optimistic about the future of the council tax, given the Government's strange language in connection with the passage of time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be even more apparent when we come to the next clause.<br><br>
In which financial year will a local authority get its resources if a process of appeal and revaluation is instituted? If there are appeals over the valuation of half or a third of the properties in a local authority's area, that authority's financial basis will be incomplete for that financial year.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the proposal that there will be no revaluations and that valuations will stand in perpetuity is not practical. How will the proposed bands cope with the great instability of property prices, which move up as well as down? When the long hours of debates in Committee and on the Floor of the House are over, the details will remain hidden in <i>Hansard.</i> They will not be made widely available through the press and the media, and people will only understand the proposals and feel their impact when it is too late to do anything about them. As with the transitional arrangements for benefits, I suspect that the Government's proposed banding system will be seen as a way of applying what might be called an exchange rate mechanism system to properties. However, such control over the property market smacks of intervention, which I would consider idealistic if the Conservative party were to agree with it. I hope that the Minister can assure us that "in perpetuity" will not be an appropriate response to his valuation proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a curious debate, because the Opposition have been tilting at windmills. When the Minister has a Spanish name, that is not unexpected. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)—a worthy Don Quixote— took up his lance and tilted at the proposition that valuations should go on in perpetuity and that the Government were against revaluations. We do not believe that valuations will go on in perpetuity and we do not propose that there should never be valuations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) cut a longer and thinner figure as Sancho Panza than I would have predicted but he was tilting at the same windmill. The hon. Gentleman broke his lance early when asked how he would value properties under the fair rating system. Answer came there none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there would be revaluations under the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
proposed scheme. We raised the matter on Second Reading and on other occasions. Will the Minister say when he envisages that there will be revaluations? Will they be done collectively, that is by revaluing other properties, or by some other system of revaluing the properties and altering the bands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition seem deeply confused. Our consultation document stated that, with a banding system, regular or frequent revaluations would not be needed. I stick by that. The Bill will enable two sorts of revaluations: one is a national revaluation, made possible by clauses 5 and 25 taken together. The other is at local level. If there is a major change in local circumstances, for example, the building of a motorway, that reduces the value of properties and one or two people appeal, the valuation officer may conclude that there has been a material change affecting several properties. He may therefore decide to alter the band into which those properties have been placed because of the substantial material change in their physical surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How local is local? For example, the impact of the oil industry on house prices in Aberdeen district and the whole of the Grampian region led to fluctuations in house prices. First they went up; then there was a slump in the oil industry and they went down. Now that the oil industry has revived, house prices have taken off again. How does one take account of those changes in relation to the rest of Scotland? Perhaps one does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's last remark is right; we would not take account of those changes, unless there were a national revaluation. My local example was of very particular circumstances affecting a small group of houses. The point that I made when I intervened during the speech of the hon. Member for Leeds, West was that in any system that depends upon property valuation like these proposals and those of the Labour party, the question is how to perform the valuation. People arrive at different conclusions. That is why it is so important that the operation should be consistent throughout the country.<br><br>
The answer to the question that I posed to the hon. Gentleman is the answer to the problem. In any system, whether a rating system or a council tax system, the valuation office must ensure that valuation is consistent everywhere. Last night, I described how the valuation office will perform that function for us under the council tax by using the data at its disposal, by establishing beacon properties in each local authority area and by conducting some of the valuations itself so that it has the ties to which to link the information that it receives from the private sector.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Our point is that banding is superior to independent valuations. Whatever the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) may say about the fluctuation in property prices—and I do not disagree with most of what has been said on that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
subject—it must be true that a fluctuation in price will be felt more immediately and more dramatically if each property has been valued individually than if it has been merely allocated to a band. There can be significant movement in the price of a property and its relative price within a band—I agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham that the relative price is the important factor—before the house transfers from one band to another.<br><br>
Our system must be more durable than an independent valuation of each property. For that reason, we believe that we can escape having regular or frequent revaluations. It would be a surprising election platform if the Opposition went to the people saying that they stand for constant revaluation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How often will the bands be reviewed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The bands will not be reviewed, except when there is a revaluation. As long as the first valuation lasts, which may be a long time, the properties that come to the notice of the listing officer as new will be put into the band in which they would have been at April 1991. There will be no change to the bands; the valuation will continue on that basis.<br><br>
Apart from tilting at windmills, the second curiosity in this debate is that the Oppostion are also tilting at banding. The "Fair Rates" document referred to banding and the hon. Member for Dagenham mentioned it as part of Labour policy. It is a relief that the hon. Gentleman is not present to intervene at this point. Although I do not want to take advantage of his absence, when he talked of banding I asked him to give more details, which he declined to do. He stuck by a half sentence, a single phrase, in the "Fair Rates" document that the annual revaluations might be on a banding basis.<br><br>
The Opposition have conducted a curious debate on the clause. They have argued against a proposition that the Government did not put forward. It must be noted that the Opposition continue to believe that there should be independent valuations, even though they understand that, with the movement of property, independent valuations would soon become out of date. Independent valuations must, by definition, be more controversial than banding valuations. It is also clear that the Labour party stands for constant revaluations in an undefined way involving banding. The British public will be interested to learn that, and now that we have heard the hon. Member for Dagenham say again that banding may feature as part of Labour policy, the Committee must be all the more confused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can draw from the Opposition an explanation of how the rolling revaluation will take place, given that there are four different factors in their valuation policy. Therefore, the four revaluations must be done concurrently, or there will be rolling chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks from a shared sense of deep frustration that during the many hours that we have sat together and on the numerous
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
occasions that we have raised these issues, we have been unable to draw from the Opposition any further elucidation of that throwaway remark in "Fair Rates". We are stuck with four revaluations, which have been described in "Fair Rates", rolling revaluations and annual revaluations. That at least is clear, although we do not know how they would be done. How the Labour party can claim that our system is administratively complex and that its own would be simple, defies belief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to understand the Minister's problem. There would not be four valuations; there would be one valuation that takes account of various factors. I must tell the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and the Minister that in Scotland, in deciding the rental value of property, assessors responsible for domestic and non-domestic valuations—some have been doing this for years—took into account all relevant factors, such as capital value, which we suggest should be taken into account now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And the insurance value?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, all the factors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in deep water now. I do not think that many valuation officers would stand up and say that, when calculating a property's rateable value, which was based on its rental value, they looked at the insurance value. The hon. Gentleman has taken advantage of the absence of his two colleagues on the Front Bench who would have waved him to his seat had they been present.<br><br>
The four revaluations have been proposed by the Labour party for one reason—they cannot be explained to the public. No one can possibly know the value of his house. It is a deliberate act of deceit against the public, because the Labour party intends to go to an election not telling people what tax they would have to pay if, unfortunately, it were returned to office. The extraordinary Marxist reinvention of the history of the rates will not carry any weight in the Committee or outside the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister started by saying that the Opposition had been tilting at windmills, but surely that applies to him. He should look at his own compilation of values in the banding system.<br><br>
This morning, we were given an extract from the third report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on the Domestic Property (Valuation) Regulations 1991. The Committee asked how the valuation of domestic property could be made on the assumption of "reasonable repair". There is a fault in that approach. Under the banding system, a valuer would have to decide whether property was in a reasonable state of repair.<br><br>
Yesterday, I said that about eight formulas were involved in the valuation system. The value of a property at April 1991 determines the band. Even the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments says that it is difficult to decide whether a property is in a proper state of repair, so how can a prospective
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
purchaser possibly know? How will that criterion be applied to the banding system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now the Labour party is even deeper in the mire. Instead of making the perfectly reasonable assumption, which is standard in valuations, that properties are on a like basis in regard to their state of repair, under the proposals in "Fair Rates" they are to be valued not only four times over and annually but according to their current state of repair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the Government's proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know what our proposal is. The hon. Gentleman says that every property should be valued according to its current state of repair. That means that when it is revalued a year later, the valuer must decide whether the state of repair has improved or become worse. Not only will a valuer have to value four times over, or every year, or on a banding system but, under "Fair Rates", he will have to take account of whether the property has been repaired in the past year and whether it has deteriorated. When the hon. Gentleman reads <i>Hansard,</i> he will understand the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If such a crazy valuation system as that proposed by the Labour party—[<i>Interruption</i>]—took account of the state of repair of properties each year, would it not greatly deter people from keeping their properties in a state of good repair? Would not it contribute to the general deterioration of housing stock in this country? Can the Minister think of a more perverse result of such an absurd system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. People would mark on their calendars the day that the rolling revaluer was coming down the street. They would chip paint off their door frames to try to make their houses look shabby, so that their house would not be revalued upwards. The Opposition make an extraordinary claim.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) yelled out during the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, "You don't know what we are proposing." That is precisely my point: the Labour party has hidden its proposals from the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. An article appeared in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday in which the Secretary of State was quoted as complaining about Labour Members filibustering on a guillotined motion in this Committee. We shall continue to refute that.<br><br>
As I understand it, the purpose of the Committee is to scrutinise the Government's proposals. If that is not the case, will you give a ruling, Mr. Leadbitter, because then we can all engage in the abuse that the Minister has degenerated to?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that often a hon. Member, with the best intentions, may go down the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
wrong track. Any suggestion of filibustering is a criticism of the Chairman. I am sure that the hon. Lady does not intend that.<br><br>
The Chairman has decided that no filibustering has gone on. It is only three minutes to 11 o'clock; we did not get in here until 10.30 am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. It is interesting that you should rule that a filibuster is an attack upon the Chairman. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) was not accusing anyone of filibustering; she was quoting the Secretary of State for the Environment who, at a press conference yesterday morning, accused Labour Members on the Committee of a filibuster. Therefore, that is an attack on you, Mr. Leadbitter, and Sir Michael because it is a cricitism of the way that the Committee is conducted. If that is so, it is your duty to report the matter to Mr. Speaker, who may care to take some action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I was present when the Secretary of State used the word. His authority for using it was your own learned remark, Mr. Leadbitter, when you described the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) as having made an irrelevant speech. The Secretary of State based his remarks on the word "irrelevant", which issued from your own wise lips.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the same thing at all. I suspect that the Minister will not construe that to be a learned remark but something that, as Lord Rothschild would say, is self-evident.<br><br>
The main and only duty of the Chairman is to see that the procedural requirements of the Committee are carried out. If some comment is made, at a press conference or elsewhere, that concerns Mr. Speaker, that is a matter for the hon. Member involved. At this stage, the Chairman has no reason to respond to any suggestion that the procedural requirements are not being met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I have always doubted what newspapers print, but if you, Mr. Leadbitter, require evidence of the word "filibuster" being used by the Secretary of State, I am happy to allow you to read my copy of the <i>Glasgow Herald,</i> which carries that report and also describes my reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall read it later. When I responded to the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo), I said that any reference to filibustering was an unfortune, albeit unintentional, criticism of the Chair. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) knows, newspaper reports are not matters for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I wish to place it on record that I have not filibustered. Many of my remarks have been cut short by the guillotine. How can I be cut short, yet take part in a filibuster?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee—we should move on. The Minister has not answered the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about perpetuity. My hon.

Friend the Member for Leeds, West stressed that people will not become aware of the difficulties that they will experience until it is too late. The Minister gave a flippant response to my hon.

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. When I was a member of a Standing Committee many years ago, I had a reputation for speaking for longer than anyone else. Being poacher-cum-gamekeeper is an interesting aspect of life in the House. I took advantage of the Chair many years ago, and I have learnt to temper being Chairman with a little understanding. The length of the Bill does not cover the length of some of my speeches on a non-timetabled motion. That has filled in a couple of minutes!</span></p>

COMPILATION AND MAINTENANCE OF LISTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 14, line 5, leave out "1st September" and insert "1st July".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 149, in page 14, line 6, leave out "15th November" and insert "15th October". No. 150, in page 14, line 6, leave out "1st December" and insert "1st November".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to highlight the tight timetable set by the Bill for local authorities to obtain a valuation list from the valuation officer in order to plan their budgets. Local authorities will have to deal with discounts, rebates and appeals, if the Bill is passed. That will influence their ability to budget for a year's commitments. In the interests of good local government, the Government agree to bring forward the dates. We propose that 15 November in line 6 should read 15 October, which would mean that the valuation list is introduced one month earlier.<br><br>
There is nothing mischievous or misleading in the proposals to replace 1 December with 1 November and 1 September with 1 July. The amendments are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
constructive: they take into consideration the treasurers and finance departments of local authorities. They have to decide from the valuation list the amount of revenue that would be recouped by the local authority if all the bills sent out were paid at the maximum level and by how much their total income will be reduced by claims for discount and rebates. It is important that that calculation be made as quickly as possible because on that decision will depend the payment to the local authority of revenue support grant from the Department of the Environment. It is crucial that the first valuation within the banding system is correct so that local authorities do not lose grant.<br><br>
It is proposed that the arrangements for the council tax valuation list should be similar to those used for non-domestic rates. The Inland Revenue will be required to appoint a listing officer to be responsible for the valuation list in each billing authority. He will provide copies of the list and notify any changes to the billing authority. The council tax technical sub-group appeared to endorse those arrangements.<br><br>
There will be changes in the valuation lists because people will appeal. When they lodge their appeal will depend on when they are notified of the value of their property and the band that it will be in. If they are notified only when they receive a demand for payment, that will cause problems for the appeal system and for the local authority in assessing its income, if property moves from a higher to a lower band on appeal.<br><br>
The value of the list will depend on the amount of grant paid by the Department. In the interests of local authorities—the collecting authorities—it is important to ensure that the system is right from the beginning. We maintain that insufficient time has been provided. The amendment would be of tremendous value to local authorities in making assessments.<br><br>
The first list to be provided to the billing authorities will be delivered by 1 September 1992. The Department has set that time for the valuation officers to deliver the advance list—as it is entitled—to the billing authorities. From that list, the authorities must estimate their 1992–93 tax base. The Department of the Environment envisages using that information to calculate and announce provisional revenue support grant entitlements under the 1992–93 settlement.<br><br>
A subsequent draft list will be provided to the billing authorities three months later, by 1 December 1992. Those billing authorities will again be required to estimate their tax base for the following year—1992–93. It is proposed that that should be the final data on which the 1992–93 revenue support grant entitlements are calculated and paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just to help the hon. Gentleman and <i>Hansard,</i> let me point out that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the year 1992–93 when he means 1993–94; he has the year wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I have the year wrong, the members of the council tax technical sub-group who met on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
30 October also have it wrong, because I am using the information in the document that it produced. And the representatives of local authorities who met that sub-group have been informed of the wrong year too. This is the third time I have been told that I am wrong. In the cases of garages and prisoners, the Minister accepted later that he was wrong. I am now being told that this Government document is wrong and the Minister is right. Is the document or the Minister right? They cannot both be right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government document that the hon. Gentleman is using has misprinted the year. The financial year 1992–93 starts on 1 April 1992 and the hon. Gentleman is talking about events that will happen after that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is another admission that officers of the Department of the Environment and of local authority associations were using a document containing incorrect figures. We only discover that the figures are wrong when we come to discuss the matter in Committee. Perhaps we should analyse this and other documents to see which figures are correct and which in error. I am prepared to change the dates so that they agree with the years suggested by the Minister, but we should scrutinise all the documents to ensure that there are no further errors.<br><br>
It is not unusual to discover errors when a Bill is rushed through in this way. The Minister has introduced a whole new chapter because an earlier version was wrong. I have referred already to the report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee draws the special attention of both Houses to these Regulations on the ground that they are so defectively drafted as not to provide a proper basis for the valuation of domestic properties under section 3 of the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991. That valuation is intended to begin the valuation exercise for the proposed council tax for which provision is made in the Local Government Finance Bill now before Parliament."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we are being told once more that the given information is inaccurate and that the figures in the document examined by the council tax technical sub-group are also incorrect. How many other elements in the charade are also wrong or misleading?<br><br>
I accept that the period under discussion could be 1993–94, but that does not alter the fact that the draft list will be provided to the billing authorities by 1 December 1992, after which they will again be required to estimate their 1993–94 tax base. It is proposed that this should be the final data on which the 1993–94 revenue support grant entitlements are calculated and paid.<br><br>
It is of paramount importance to local government that authorities be given the maximum time to ensure that the figures and details are correct and that they get the full revenue support grant to which they are entitled. In all fairness to local authorities and their taxpayers—and the consultation paper says a great deal about fairness—as much time as possible should be allowed so that they can gather accurate information and obtain all the grant to which they are entitled.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
The initial council tax bills are also expected to be based on the bands contained in the list to be submitted to the billing authorities, which will be required to make that and subsequent, amended lists available for public inspection. If the list is not provided until December, there will be only about 12 or 13 weeks—we must allow for the Christmas period in that time as well—before the tax bills are sent out on 1 April 1993. That means that the timetable for notifying the public about inspection of the list, which will affect their payments and the band into which their property will be placed, will be very tight.<br><br>
Listing officers will be required to compile definitive valuation lists on 1 April 1993 and to provide billing authorities with a copy as soon as possible thereafter. The time between the first submission of the draft list and the compilation of the definitive list is very limited. I hope that the Minister and Conservative Members will consider the matter very carefully, given its importance to local authorities. The valuation officer proposes that subsequent alterations to the valuation list be notified to the billing authorities by regular schedules of alterations. In addition, the valuation officer proposes providing four-monthly snapshots of lists showing their state on a particular day.<br><br>
The inference from the Joint Committee's report is that changes, perhaps regular changes, will occur. The Government plan to ensure that every four months a review takes place of the billing list which is lodged with the local authority. Will the Minister explain why it is anticipated that the valuation officer will need to give details of alterations to the valuation list, if no major alterations are envisaged? New properties will be included and an appeals procedure will be in place, but if the valuation officer has to present a report to the billing authority every 15 or 16 weeks, the operation will be very complicated and we must be told what changes the Government expect in the valuation list.<br><br>
The first list is necessary for local authorities to estimate their tax base for budgeting and grant purposes. We have evidence of how difficult it is for local authorities to operate within the financial restrictions imposed by the Department of the Environment. The capping procedure and the SSAs make matters difficult for local authorities. Local government understands that, for grant purposes, it is important to get the tax base right.<br><br>
The time limit set by the Government is very tight. Local authorities will need to adjust the list for discounts to arrive at their true tax base. No one knows what the results of the applications for discounts will be. The adjustment to the list because of the discount applications will affect the tax base of a local authority. Authorities will need to know which properties have discounts, because 25 per cent off a band H dwelling is a larger reduction in tax base than 25 per cent off a band A dwelling. This will not have such a great effect in my area where more properties fall into band A than band H, but Conservative Members' areas sometimes have large numbers of properties in band H. The discount paid will have a tremendous effect on the tax base of a local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 595</span>
authority. Conservative Members should carefully consider the amendments because they are in the interests of their local authorities as well as those controlled by the Labour party. Knowing the tax base and acknowledging the influence of discounts is very important—and tempus fugit.<br><br>
How will authorities know how much grant will be paid to them, given the discount procedure? Information has so far been poor. We are told that there will be advertisements and that the billing authorities will distribute notices. We look for an improvement in the provision of information. The Department of the Environment will use the list to estimate the likely level of council tax bills for the announcement of the 1995 RSG. How accurate will the Government's forecast be? The accuracy of the first forecast is important. How will the Department forecast tax levels for 1993–94? Local authorities will depend on the grants that they receive that year to sustain their services.<br><br>
I referred to a second list which is even more crucial. It constitutes the final data on which the grant will be based. It will not provide much more reliable information than the first list. It will provide no clearer information about discounts, because such a short time will elapse between the compilation of the two lists. Most householders will not have begun their appeals against valuations because they will not know about the appeals procedures.<br><br>
Many people will find it difficult to pay their bills. If they believe that they are entitled to a reduction in their bills, they may appeal and be moved from a higher to a lower band. People who work in local government ask how people will find out about discounts in time for authorities to budget for the support grant, and how householders will be able to commence their appeals against valuations in time for local authorities to calculate their effect on their budgets. If the success fo appeals during the first year of the tax causes a significant reduction in local authorities' income, how will the Government compensate them for that loss of revenue?<br><br>
The local authority association has raised the matter with the Department and asked for grant calculations, at least for the first year, to be flexible. The Government could ease matters by ensuring that grant calculations for the first year were not set in concrete. They could provide opportunities for a review and for adjustments so that local authorities could be compensated with new money for loss of revenue. The banding procedure is untried and we cannot predict its outcome.<br><br>
It would be wrong to withhold part of the grant from the budget set by the Government. Will there be new money to cover the problem? Will there be clawback, as has happened in the past? The Government clawed back money from the revenue support grant if local authorities made a hash of things.<br><br>
Ministers must surely realise the enormity of the task that the Government have set the valuation office and the private sector by introducing the banding system. The Government appear to have overlooked the enormity of the task imposed on local authorities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 596</span>
11.30 am<br><br>
We can imagine that the same problem will arise in administering the council tax as arose with the poll tax. In the light of our experience when considering the Local Government Finance Bill 1988, as it then was, we maintain that the dates in this Bill are too tight. Local authority associations want more time. If the extention were for only a month, it would benefit local government.<br><br>
The Department of the Environment says that local authorities will be required to provide estimates of their tax base during September and will expect them to take discounts into account. That is startling. How can the Government expect local authorities to provide a suggested tax base for determining the revenue support grant and to take discounts into account? It is impossible for local authorities to do that with accuracy. How does the Minister think that local authorities can conform with that request?<br><br>
When the initial list is available by 1 September— or by 1 July, if our amendment is accepted—local authorities will have to input the computer data and agree the list with the valuation office. No information will be available on the balancing totals that will accompany the list, nor will there be any relevant information from the valuation office. Local authorities will then have to investigate any discrepancies against the background of the sinking poll tax administration. We must remember that while the council tax is being introduced, the dying embers of the poll tax must still be tended. We have often observed that local authorities will still have problems in collecting the poll tax.<br><br>
The draft lists sent to local authorities must be complete and I assume that the final list will not be very different.<br><br>
The valuation office must not produce a list and then say "but", or "if or, "When we get further information we shall communicate with you." There should be no special cases. Local authorities need the information so that the preliminary revenue support grant calculations can be based on the first list. The valuation office must have correct details in the first instance otherwise chaos will result.<br><br>
It appears that the valuation office will determine its own timetable and the billing authorities will have to work round it. If that is so, it should be a matter for discussion and reasonable negotiation. If the valuation office can comply with the amended timetable, authorities will be better equipped to comply with the requirement of the Department of the Environment to send the second tranche of tax-based information.<br><br>
Local authorities require the support and assistance of the valuation office and the Government to ensure that the information they send to the Department of the Environment is accurate and detailed. It would help local authorities to prepare their first bills more accurately if the proposed timetable is changed as suggested in the amendments.<br><br>
The Government should ensure that information on banding sent to local authorities is correct. I believe that some advice from Government Departments was based on a miscalculation, and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 597</span>
proposed changes in the timetable will therefore help people working in local government departments. If it is not possible for the valuation office to amend its programme to accommodate the problems faced by local authorities, perhaps the Minister will say why the new timetable cannot be adopted.<br><br>
The constructive amendments will benefit local authorities and I appeal to the Minister to accept them. I shall, however, listen with interest if he argues that our timetable is not acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Leadbitter. First, I shall say good morning to the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities, even though he is not in his place. In an earlier intervention—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter, I am in my place. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I meant the Under-Secretary, whom I promoted. The Minister must be careful now. As I said, the Under-Secretary has been invisible so far today. However, the Minister of State did wish me good morning. I was unable to return his greeting as I was making an intervention, so I should like to do so now, just for the record.<br><br>
My reason for being a little late for this morning's proceedings is that today is my wife's birthday. We had breakfast together, which I made and which we both enjoyed very much. I shall not dwell on the fact that I have spent so much time in this Room that I was unable to get her a decent present. My wife is a little older than I, so I have given her a badge that says, "You're only as old as the man that you feel".—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I only hope that she does not feel any younger, but that is by the by.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to carry on with that line of conversation, Mr. Leadbitter, or I shall be accused of filibustering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the badge to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred been cleared with the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo), who I understand has strong views on such sexist material?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had better not go any further down that road, Mr. Leadbitter, or you will tell me off.<br><br>
I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). The timetable for these proposals is extremely tight. The amendment is valuable in that it would bring forward the date by which the lists must be prepared by the valuation officers. That would allow local authorities more time to prepare and send out accurate bills and to programme the information into their computers. As a result, local authorities would be able to do their billing job more efficiently.<br><br>
I suspect that the Minister will reply that that will mean that the Inland Revenue valuation office will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 598</span>
not have sufficient time to do its job. I see that the Minister is nodding his head. That shows two things: first, that the Bill's timetable is far too tight for both the Inland Revenue valuation office and the local authorities; and secondly, that the Government clearly do not care about the problems that they create for local authorities, which must try to collect local taxes as efficiently as possible. To please the Inland Revenue, the Government have decided that local authorities should be required to solve all the problems involved in the billing process.<br><br>
The Government must explain why local government is being put on the rack. Why cannot the misery be shared out more equitably between the Inland Revenue's valuation office and the local councils?—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The Under-Secretary for the Environment has arrived. I had better not offer any more good morning greetings, lest I have to go into the reasons for my lateness again, so I shall keep to the point.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton said, the first list—called the advance list—to be provided to the billing authorities by the valuation office will be delivered by 1 September 1992. The authorities will be required to estimate from that list their 1992–93 tax base. The Department of the Environment envisages using that information to calculate and announce provisional revenue support grant entitlements under the 1992–93 settlement.<br><br>
That will give scope for many more fiddles in the rate support grant system. There are already many fiddles associated with the standard spending assessment system. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) pointed out in the Chamber earlier this week that Harrow is calculated to have a greater snowfall than Cumbria. The Government calculate that Tory Brent has 14 days of snowfall, whereas nearby the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is reckoned to have less than eight days of snowfall. I believe that Gloucester gets a grant according to the number of children under five in the area even though its nurseries are provided not by the local authority, but privately, yet authorities that do provide facilities for their children in need do not receive as much grant. Those are examples of fiddles under the SSA system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: SSAs are a guide for financial distribution. The hon. Gentleman would be the first to complain if every authority were required to spend exactly what was recommended under the SSA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that there should be "local freedom" to spend what is required to provide for local needs. The trouble is that, when authorities do that, the Government cap them. Much of that capping is based on the difference between what they spend and what the Government say that they should spend within the SSA system. If the Government want to fiddle the system so it works against certain authorities, they set the SSAs too low and then are more likely to cap them.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
An inaccurate valuation list gives the Government scope to alter the RSG settlement in favour of their preferred authorities and against those that they dislike. That is the problem with an inaccurate advance and final list. It is on the final list, to be provided to billing authorities by 1 December 1992, that the authorities will be required to estimate their 1992–93 tax base. That will be the final data for calculating and paying the 1992–93 revenue support grant entitlement. The initial council tax bills will also be based on the bands in that list. Authorities are required to make available for public inspection that list and subsequent lists. Therefore, they will have much to do in connection with the data.<br><br>
It worries me that that constitutes the final date on which tax banding and the Government grant will be based. Council tax valuations, especially in London, will be unstable. Local authority associations in London have data to prove that house prices in London vary enormously. Some increase rapidly in a short time. House prices rose by 33 per cent in one London borough, but by only 9 per cent in another during the same period. Instability could be built into the valuation bands. The Government believe that the bands will be permanent. The Minister said that the allocation of property to individual bands would remain in perpetuity. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said:
<br><blockquote><p>"One of the great advantages of the council tax is that, because of the banding system, it will not require constant revaluations."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 19 November 1991; c.36.]</p></blockquote>
The Government consider the valuation process to be permanent. Yet it is inadequate for the valuation office, the Inland Revenue, and especially for local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just argued that the valuation process is inadequate for the valuation office, yet he supports an amendment that would shorten the time that the valuation office has to consider the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The time granted to the valuation office poses a serious problem for local authorities. However the data should not be final for grant allocation to local authorities, or for valuation. It cannot be final, because many appeals will be made and they will alter the valuations. The valuation process will be unstable and lead to pressure for regular revaluation.<br><br>
Local authority associations have also told the Department of the Environment that the data should not be final. They say that if reductions in tax bases are made during the year, the Government should compensate local authorities with new money. They do not want any offsetting reductions in the grants of other authorities—no "clawback", to use the RSG jargon of the early 1980s. They want new money.<br><br>
The timetable for valuations is inadequate. The date should be brought forward so that local authorities can distribute bills more efficiently, especially as valuations will be carried out in a cursory way by estate agents walking down a street and by aerial photography. That is not a realistic valuation of property. It would be better to bring the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
date forward, with the proviso that the data is not final.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I watched the Opposition's tactics with fascination. It is well known that if there is a timetable motion, Opposition parties in Committee use every opportunity to show the other place that a Bill has not been debated properly. We had an interesting example of that this morning when the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) spoke from 11.2 am to 11.38 am, that is, for 36 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Gentleman is shouting, because he was having a cup of tea at the time. I thought that the hon. Member for Normanton was speaking for so long to allow his hon. Friends to have elevenses break, but it turned into banquet break.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen), who is no slouch, began to speak at 11.38. It took him two minutes to say good morning and to tell us about his wife's birthday. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are slipping again into questioning how the Chairman conducts the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are. Once a member of the Committee complains about how long another member of the Committee speaks, he is implying, with more than a wink and a nod, that the Chairman has allowed it to happen. Given the opportunity, all Members of Parliament would speak for hours and hours and succeed in saying nothing. I am still worried about a matter that was raised earlier. I have said that this is not a point of order for me, but it is important that there is no imputation that the Chairman is allowing a hon. Member so much freedom that he uses and abuses the time of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You misunderstand me, Mr. Leadbitter. I was merely talking about the length of speeches. God forbid that I should suggest that Opposition Members would filibuster or be guilty of tedious repetition! That was the furthest matter from my thoughts. However, it is worth noting that when the Opposition want to make a point in detail, they bring out their secret weapons—the Members for Normanton and for Leyton. The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), who is not here at the moment, is also in the heavy gun league.<br><br>
When some student from the United States comes to write the history of the Committee, for his PhD, the speeches of the hon. Member for Normanton will go down as an exemplar of how one can put forward a detailed case on a very narrow point. The first amendment deals with a period of three months; the other amendments refer to some days. In his exhaustive speech, the hon. Gentleman went into great detail.<br><br>

We recognise that the timetable is tight, which is why the Government will allow the private sector to help with valuations, but we must strike a balance between the needs of local authorities to know what their valuation lists and their RSG will be and the need to ensure that the lists are as accurate as possible. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Normanton for making that point. The Government considers that the amendment would not give the valuation office sufficient time for the work to be completed by 1 July 1992 as required by amendment No. 148.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton made the same mistake as the hon. Member for Normanton when he referred to the RSG in 1992–1993. It is the RSG in 1993–94. It will be distributed according to a formula based on the list delivered between 15 November and 1 December 1992. That is of importance to all local authorities in England and Wales. We must ensure that the information is as up-to-date and accurate as possible, so it does not make sense to advance the dates by one month as amendments Nos. 149 and 150 suggest.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister agrees that local authorities must give correct information to guide the Department of the Environment on grant distribution, can he explain how that information can be supplied if local authorities do not know the amount of discount that will be paid? Secondly, authorities will not know the results of appeals or how they will affect their budgets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with those two points. Local authorities can start finding out the likely level of discounts as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. They will not have to wait for the valuation list to collate information on discounts. That will help local authorities considerably. If, with the Opposition's agreement, we can get the provision on to the statute book by early spring, local authorities will have a year to do the work on their discounts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Leyton and then return to the second point raised by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he expects local authorities to have all their discounts sorted out by November or December next year when the list is deposited with the Department of the Environment so that it can decide the RSG? Will the list take discounts into account? If the local authority has not managed to sort out the total discounts by that date will the Department go ahead with the revenue support grant allocation regardless?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two separate points, the first of which concerns the individual's discount. Local authorities must determine who is entitled to that discount by whichever means they choose—it could be by canvass or an individual could claim the discount when forms are sent out.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 602</span>
The second point concerns the aggregate number of discounts in a local authority area. Local authorities will have a fairly good idea of the numbers entitled to a single-person discount through the information available on the community charge register and other information, such as the electoral list. Local authorities will also have the aggregate information from the census. I stress that that is the aggregate information for a local authority area on the basis of the number of single-person households in the district. Aggregate information should be available fairly easily, but the exact information on which individuals are entitled to a discount will take a little longer.<br><br>
I expect that by the latter part of next year local authorities will have fairly accurate information, although they will have to work with some speed. We recognise that there will be pressures on local authorities and on valuation teams.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On discounts, an authority may know the number of single-person households, but it will not know which bands those dwellings are in. That will influence its budget. If the authority does not know whether the household is in band A, or H, or B, how can it assess the reduction in income?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By September local authorities will have the initial valuation. The valuation officer will use the local authority's property identification codes to make the merging of the two lists easier and more straightforward.<br><br>
A series of processes will be carried out in the six-month period. As the hon. Member for Normanton will see, subsection (5) states not later than 1 September 1992. If valuation teams get the information before that date they will give it to the local authority which can merge the two sets of information in time for the revenue support grant settlement negotiations later in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What did the Minister mean when he said that the valuation office will use the local authorities' description of properties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The old rates forms have a property identification code by which the computer identifies each property within a local authority area. That system will continue. The local authority has a list of the properties in its area and it will marry up—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The old rating list?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. The local authority will have a mixture of the old rating list. It is not for Ministers to instruct local authorities how to organise their identification codes. Local authorities have different ways of using their property identification codes and I know of no local authority in which these are not computerised. Updating may be by means of the community charge registers, which have identification codes, and have already been passed to the valuation office. Property identification codes will be married up with the discount lists compiled by local authorities. It will not bear much fruit to argue—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 603</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the Minister who is filibustering now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee must be aware that I am thinking deeply about the original issue. It has not yet been dispensed with. I have a responsibility to protect the business of the Committee and I caution every member of the Committee against making the slightest suggestion that the Chair is not complying with Standing Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It ill behoves the hon. Member for Normanton to ask me about identification codes and then to accuse me of filibustering when I give him an answer. Either he wants the information or he does not. The Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991 gives powers to local authorities to pass to valuation officers the property identification codes from the community charge register.<br><br>
Before I took a question from the hon. Member for Leyton the hon. Gentleman asked me how appeals about banding would affect revenue. It would depend first upon the number of appeals and on their success rate. The Government's broad bands will reduce the number of appeals, unlike amendment No. 220, tabled by the hon. Member for Normanton, which will require precise valuations. Valuation officers will ensure consistency of valuations and there is no reason to expect that appeals will be more successful in one area than another, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.<br><br>
The problem with revising grant in-year to reflect a high number of successful appeals—that is what the hon. Member for Normanton feared—is that some authorities would gain money, while others would have to lose money within the fixed amount of Government grant that is available for the year. It would be unrealistic to expect central Government to provide new money, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. Indeed, experience of the previous Labour Government shows that, far from increasing local authority spending in-year, any future Labour Government would be prepared to cut the money available for local government.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton also mentioned the reviews of the list that would take place every four months. Those reviews are needed to take account of new or demolished properties or properties that are split or merged, as well as changes resulting from public appeals. The public must have access to up-to-date information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's support. For example, there were typically a quarter of a million changes each year under the old rates system. However, under the proposed banding system, which the Labour party opposes, there are likely to be fewer appeals.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton argued for his amendments with great skill and ingenuity, but they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 604</span>
are unnecessary. The Government have struck a proper balance between the requirement that local authorities prepare for the 1993-94 financial year and the need to ensure that local authorities get the right amount of money through revenue support grant. The proposed system, according to which the initial list will be available on 1 September and the final list will be available between 15 November and 1 December 1992, is right, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary criticised me for taking 36 minutes to present my case. He has spent 25 minutes explaining the Government's proposals. Much of what he said was waffle, as he knows nothing about the subject. The Government would have been better advised to put the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Environment in to bat on this issue, as it is clear that the hon. Member for Monmouth, who is Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, knows very little about it. Ministers with responsibility for local government should take part in local government debates, not someone from over the border.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should check his facts. I spoke for 15 minutes, and I am the Member for Pembroke, not for Monmouth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the same difference. Wherever the hon. Gentleman comes from, it is a place where very little is known about local government. The Under-Secretary for the Environment would have done a better job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was a member of a local authority for eight years. I was the leader of the opposition on that authority, and for three years I was a member of the Inner London education authority. I think that I know a little about local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Gentleman's experience did him little good. All we heard from him today was waffle. The presentation of my case was delayed in part, by his intervention to correct a passage in a document published by the Department of the Environment. His contribution contained other inaccuracies, especially when he spoke about local government property identification codes. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary has said that the Government are relying on local authorities' rating valuation lists to identify properties. We have said all along that those lists were one of the best systems for judging local government income. The Under-Secretary has agreed that our faith in those lists has some substance. That is why we maintain that if Ministers listened more to local government, people in local government would be served.<br><br>
Our point, which to some extent has been accepted, is that the timetable is tight. The Under-Secretary said that as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent people can find out who qualifies for discount. That may be correct, but the number of people qualifying for discount is not the important figure. We want to know the amount of discount that is said to be paid by local authorities. That will decide the amount of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 605</span>
rate support grant for 1993–94. The Under-Secretary does not know what he is talking about. I am sure that we should have been given a different answer to the question on discounts from a Minister who is up-to-date on such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. The hon. Gentleman must have been busy writing his speech when I was making the point. Let me say again, simply, that local authorities have property identification codes. Some local authorities have used as the basis for that their old rating list, which they updated for the community charge register. The Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991 enables local authorities to transfer that information to the valuation office. Therefore, the valuation office uses the local authority identification codes in its valuations of properties. Using the same valuation codes the local authority will be able to consider discounts for individuals. On 1 September, local authorities will receive the initial valuation list. Using the same codes they can marry up the information on property and individuals who are entitled to discounts. That is a fair and simple process and if the hon. Gentleman does not understand it, that is his problem, not mine.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has taken to heart my point that he knows nothing about the matter; he is trying to justify himself in an intervention. He should give the catalogue of dates and Acts that he has just cited to the local authority associations and see what their response would be— it would be identical to what I am saying. He is way out on the issue of working out a programme to help local government. He tells us that he was the leader of an opposition in local government and, given the way in which he has conducted himself today, it will not be long before he is in Opposition again.<br><br>
However, I wonder about his local government experience. He has been rabbitting on about how various Acts would apply, but has not dealt with the issue. He has not discussed the matter or tried to assess how the timetable would affect the ability of local authorities to apply the measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will not leave the subject of property identification codes, by which the Under-Secretary has laid great store, because they do not tie up with the bands that the Government have set. When my hon. Friend asked how discounts fit into the individual bands, the Under-Secretary waffled and said that that was a matter for local authorities. Clearly, local authorities do not have the opportunity to marry them up— certainly not by using the property identification codes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously my hon. Friend is listening carefully. His comment on the Under-Secretary's remarks is correct. The Under-Secretary was misleading the Committee in his observations after I had outlined my anxiety about the inadequacy of how he presented his experience. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) can speak from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 606</span>
experience because he used to work on the rates in his local authority. It was his job to make amendments and to determine the income from rateable values. The Under-Secretary says that there will be regular presentations of revaluations every four months.<br><br>
Trying to get facts from Ministers is like pulling teeth from tigers. Ministers make statements to the Committee and, when we challenge them, they discover that they are wrong. This is the third or fourth time in the past few days that we have exposed the Government's weaknesses. I am sure that one reason why the Secretary of State does not attend the Committee is that, if he did, we would probably find out that he was trying to mislead us, as he often does on those rare occasions he addresses the House. He takes little interest in the Bill, despite his responsibility for local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman said that my right hon. Friend misleads the House, but I do not think that he meant that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that comments are made about local government, and I referred to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Comments are made about the way in which local government has to operate in the present circumstances. The Secretary of State tells us how it works, but I do not think that he is strictly correct, given what those involved in local government say.<br><br>
We were told that a document which was jointly considered by the Department of the Environment and local government representatives was misleading. That is the evidence that I used, and if the Secretary of State uses the same evidence, he is not correct in what he says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give me one example of how I got my facts wrong this morning, when I gave my outline of why the Government oppose the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I consider that the Minister got his facts wrong when he referred to the local government code for identifying properties. I said that that involved the old rating system and he said that it was a different system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>Hansard</i> will tell. I am prepared to give way to the hon. Gentleman to allow him to explain the different systems. He also said that there was a property identification code on the poll tax bills, so I ask him to give further details. A poll tax bill relates to a person, not to a property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The bill is sent to an address.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is sent to an address, but whether it is the correct address is another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah. Again, the Under-Secretary is saying that that is what he meant. If we are judging
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 607</span>
legislation on the basis of what the Under-Secretary meant and not on the facts, it is no wonder that we find ourselves in difficulty. The Government will find themselves in the same position with the Bill as they were with the poll tax legislation. Ministers, including the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, are coming to the Committee to defend a system which was presented in a hopeless manner and that is why we are in difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about accuracy but mentions a local government code. That is a different issue. I made it very clear that a local government property identification code is a matter for local authorities to decide. They have different systems by which they encode property. However, we know that each local authority uses a computer which has a property code. Some authorities put the code on the community charge bill, but all have a code for each property. If the hon. Gentleman will carefully examine the way in which local authorities work, he will see that.<br><br>
The Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991 enabled local authorities to pass over their property code numbers to the valuation officers to prepare the council tax information required to value properties in the coming year. There is no argument about that. Some local authorities may well have used their old ratings and others may not. It is for them to decide how their property code identifiers are organised. That was the point which I made to the hon. Gentleman. He wants to make a conspiracy out of nothing. There is no conspiracy; it is up to local authorities to decide which system to use. The fact is that they have a property identification code. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would grasp that simple point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing simple comes from the Under-Secretary, or perhaps it is simple. Nothing simple has come from him in the present debate. No one knows what the cost of the discounts or of appeals against valuation will be because the system will be new, yet the Under-Secretary is saying that there will be no new money, no matter how great the costs may be.<br><br>
There will be further cuts in local authority services and provisions because the Government will give no new money to local government. That says it all: we are witnessing a further attack on local government services. The Under-Secretary said that he would not press for new money to ensure that local government could function under the new system. That is very disappointing. When people read what he said in his intervention—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to give way to the Under-Secretary because every time he intervenes he weakens his case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not right in saying that the Government are not providing any new money. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment announced two days ago
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 608</span>
that 75 per cent towards the implementation of the council tax will be outside aggregate external finance. That represents £86 million in England. On the same day, in a written answer, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales announced £5.9 million for Welsh local authorities. Again, 75 per cent will be outside AEF. Clearly, that is new money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I ask the Minister how the Secretary of State assessed how much money would be needed for discounts and appeals about banding. If the Secretary of State gave information to the Minister that he did not give to the House, why does not the Minister share it with the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the Minister had faced up to his tasks he would have taken account of the views of local authority associations when preparing for their expected costs? He would also have taken account of poll tax collection costs for several years beyond the introduction of the council tax. If he had taken those factors into account the figure would have been much greater than that suggested by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) has introduced a new argument, and I hope that the Minister was listening to his comments.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell the Committee how much money will be available to cover the cost of discounts and appeals? The Minister reminded the Committee about the Secretary of State's announcement, so he is propagating the gospel of new money. To narrow my question, how much money was included in the statement solely for discounts? Again, the Minister has introduced an argument that he cannot follow up. In future, the issue should be left to the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment because he does a much better job than the Under-Secretary of State for Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister reads <i>Hansard</i> and compares the contributions of the two Under-Secretaries of State he will see that the difference between them is as plain as that between day and night. I shall let the Under-Secretary of State for Wales intervene if he can tell us how much of the money to which the Secretary of State referred is intended to cover discounts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not appear to understand that my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Wales announced on Tuesday that the 75 per cent money that was in AEF will now be outside—£86 million in England and £5.9 million in Wales is for the implementation costs of local authorities in 1992–93. That has nothing to do with the council tax once it is up and running in 1993–94, when discounts come into effect. The money is to meet the cost of preparing for the council tax in the next financial year.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 609</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, this highlights the extent to which the Under-Secretary is misguided. I asked him for information about new money. I made it clear that I was referring to new money to cover discounts and money lost to local authorities because of the appeal procedure. In response the Under-Secretary said that the Secretary of State made an announcement two days ago, giving details of new money that would be available to local authorities. Now we are told that that is for administrative costs. Will he now answer my question? How much money does the Secretary of State estimate will be needed to cover the cost of discounts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now know why the hon. Gentleman is known as Woolly O'Brien. He clearly does not understand what we are talking about. I have been speaking about the cost of implementation in 1992–93 and the statements by my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State on Tuesday. With regard to 1993–94 and local authority money, the hon. Gentleman will have to wait until we come to the settlement for 1993–94, which is a year away. I obviously cannot be expected to make a statement about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I am saying is that we have received no answer from the Under-Secretary to important questions about local government. It is disappointing that, after such a long debate on the matter, the Under-Secretary is still shadow-boxing over the financing of local government, and that our amendments cannot be accepted by the Government. The Under-Secretary has sat smiling like a Cheshire cat, thinking that he has done a good job on behalf of the Government. I am disappointed in the way in which the Government has been represented by him.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 14, line 12, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6A) The Listing Officer shall deposit a copy of the lists mentioned in subsections 5(a) and 5(b) above at his principal office and take such steps as he thinks most suitable for giving notice of it.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 152, in page 14, line 16, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8A) As soon as reasonably practicable after compiling the list the Listing Officer shall deposit it at his principal office.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment and, as it is not of such great import as the previous amendment, the debate will no doubt be shorter. The purpose of the amendment is to establish what arrangements the Government are making to notify people of the band in which their dwelling is placed. The Bill provides that the final banding list will be sent to authorities, which will make it available for public inspection and draw the attention of the public to it, usually through advertisements in local newspapers. Most people, however, will probably miss the advertisements and will not know the band in which their property has been valued until they receive their council tax bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
The important question that we are asking the Government is why they have changed their mind on the matter. Annex 1 to the council tax technical sub-group paper which was considered on 11 July this year said that, after December 1992,
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities (are) to notify occupiers of banding as soon as reasonably practical, and before 1 March 1991."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 1991?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously a misprint in the information that I have been given—the year should have been 1993.<br><br>
Although it was not appropriate that local authorities should have carried out the task, the Government's first thoughts were preferable for several reasons. They thought originally that individual notifications should be sent of the bands into which households would be placed.<br><br>
For once, the Government were right. The banding exercise is the linchpin of the council tax. If the public are to have faith in the banding process, they must be told about it. It would be a disaster for an authority trying to collect the tax if appeals against banding were not lodged until after the bills were sent out. Whatever the provisions might state about payment, when there is an appeal against the bands, people will not pay. Such issues have nothing to do with the local authority. The Government have set the bands. The valuation office and the estate agents will carry out the valuations. It would be a fairer approach if the valuation office was made to notify the occupier of each dwelling in good time of the dwelling's band.<br><br>
The fear that underlies many of the difficulties that we have discussed is that the Bill is being rushed through Committee. That is why our proceedings have been guillotined. Even though the poll tax provisions were discussed in Committee for three months as opposed to three weeks, many of its proposals were badly thought out and untested. I suspect that that also applies to the council tax provisions.<br><br>
For members of the public to have confidence in the banding system, they must be notified individually and properly in writing by the valuation office of their banding arrangements. If that system was accepted, the tax stands a better chance of success than it does at present. I shall be grateful if the Minister will respond to my points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on being a model of brevity. It is important for people to know the band into which they will fall. I am pleased that they will have the opportunity to know that, if they closely monitor the position from December 1992. It is true that we now propose that the notification to individual households of the bands into which they will fall should take place in April 1993. The hon. Member for Torfaen was right when he said that we proposed originally that individual notifications should be made during the spring of that year.<br><br>
However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that, in drawing up our proposals, we

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 611</span>
have taken account of the views of the local authority associations. I am not trying to score a point, but Opposition Members often argue that we should consult local authority associations on implementation and methodology. It was the view of the associations that they would not be in a position during the spring to notify people individually of their bands.<br><br>
I am disappointed that the local authority associations were unable to comply with our original proposal, but we must take their views into account, and they have convinced us that, during that critical period of development, such a task would be too difficult for them to undertake. Such a decision does not put members of the public in an unreasonable position. The most concerned member of the public will be able to inspect the draft list in December 1992. Other members of the public will receive individual notifications in April 1993 and they can appeal at that time. The hon. Gentleman asked a fairly simple question and I have given him a fairly simple answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notification that people will receive in April 1993 will be their bills on which will be printed the bands into which they fall. If, at that stage, people wish to appeal against the banding, they can do so. There will then be a problem as people who are in the process of appealing against a bill will not pay it. Will the Minister explain what guidelines and backup will be given to the local authorities? A lot of appeals will clearly have an impact on a local authority's cash flow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A person who receives a bill should pay it, even though it is subject to appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But they do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They should, even so. As the hon. Lady will realise, everybody would appeal against the bill so that they could avoid paying it if the rule was that an appeal against a bill meant that payment could be withheld. The rule is that the bill must be paid, but the bill may be adjusted after a successful appeal.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) said that the valuation office, which will carry out the valuation, should be required to notify people, and the amendment states that a list should be placed in the valuation office. The critical factor is the convenience of the public. Speaking as a member of the public, I do not know where my local valuation office is, but I certainly know where my town hall is. People are used to going into their town hall to pay their rents or community charge, or to inspect planning applications or to make inquiries. It is a place where there is a ready flow of people in and out. That makes the town hall a sensible place to display the draft list, especially as the local authority will be the billing authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment. We are trying to understand how the system will work. Is it the Minister's normal practice, on receipt of a bill from an organisation or a company that he considers unfair, to pay up first and take up the dispute later?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 612</span>
It is important to establish common practice when dealing with principles.<br><br>
The Minister said that a draft list would be made available. It is his intention that people may appeal against the draft list, or must they wait until they receive notification?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an informal level short of appeal. Some hon. Members may believe that a person's only course of action is to launch a formal appeal and to go before a tribunal. However, there is an intermediate course of action.<br><br>
People might wish to contact the valuation office simply to discover whether a mistake has been made. One of two problems may have arisen. First, there may be a dispute between the council tax payer and the valuation office about the valuation. Secondly, a person may believe simply that a mistake has been made. He may want to know why his property is in band C when his next door neighbour's has been placed in band B. That problem could readily be resolved by the valuation office. Such an informal approach in connection with the draft list would be absolutely correct, as that list, being a draft, may contain omissions or errors. I hope that the number of mistakes is low, but it must be remembered that that is not the final list. However, a full appeal can be launched only against the final list.<br><br>
As for my practice in paying bills, I suppose that that has become a sensitive topic since yesterday. A bill owed to a private company cannot be settled by an independent tribunal in the way that a council tax bill—or, in days gone by, a rates or community charge bill—can. If I do not pay my bill to a private contractor, that contractor has the right to take me to court. He can ask me to pay him the money, and I would have to prove that I did not owe him that amount. The rules are that a council tax bill should be paid on receipt. If there has been an error, one should get in touch with one's local authority or valuation office to see if the problem can be sorted out. But there is an obligation to pay, and the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) should understand that, without that obligation to pay while an appeal is in progress, everyone would appeal and no one would pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The big difference is that there can now be no appeal prior to delivery of a bill. That is significant, because many people would appeal prior to receiving a bill. That would have been possible had the timetable been more sensible, but regrettably the Government's timetable excludes such appeals. Can the Minister take the matter away to consider a solution to the problem? Most people's appeals are genuine and if they want to appeal they would like to do so without the threat of having a bill at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But as I said, if people observe an error on the December 1992 list, they will get in touch with the valuation office. Many matters will be settled more quickly in that informal way than if taken to appeal.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 613</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says in Committee may sound feasible, but it is preposterous to assume that everyone in a city the size of Bristol who is liable to pay the tax in December 1992 will say, "Oh, I am liable to pay the tax from April 1993 so I should check the bandings to make sure that the bill I get on 1 April hasn't got any errors." That will not happen, but if it did, goodness knows what Bristol city council would do with that number of people.<br><br>
The first notification for the vast majority of people will be their bill. A challenge to banding has not to be advocated as a way of not paying, but when people are challenging bills, they tend not to pay them. If that happens because, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Stewart) says, there is a very short timetable, it could cause immense cash-flow and administrative problems for local authorities which are still clearing up problems from the poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can add much to what I have already said. We have already discussed the extensive advertising that will draw people's attention to the fact that draft lists are available. Therefore, people will be able to inspect the lists and correct errors.<br><br>
If people are paying by instalments, they would be well advised to continue the payments because if they do not do so, the entire amount for the year becomes due. The most sensible course of action is for people to continue to pay while they appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the Minister, I would advise my constituents to continue to pay no matter how long the appeal procedure takes. That is most sensible, and it is the best advice that a Member of Parliament or a councillor should give constituents. If there are problems, a Member of Parliament or councillor can intervene and try to make appropriate arrangements for payments.<br><br>
We should make it clear that we do not want repossessions to take place. Some people have been given advice and needlessly found themselves in dreadful debt. I support the Minister in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not the Scottish National party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any problems with the Scottish National party in Makerfield, or with anybody in Makerfield.<br><br>
I want to extend access to the draft lists. We mentioned the town hall, but would it not also be practical to place lists in post offices and libraries and even in building societies which do valuations. It would not be expensive and it would provide greater access, which would be a helpful concession.<br><br>
At about ten minutes to 2 this morning, I made the point to the Under-Secretary that there should be precise arrangements for taking informal decisions so that appeals are unnecessary. We should beef up the Bill to ensure that that happens, as going to a tribunal could be taken as a sign of failure. We should ensure that as many complaints as possible are dealt with on an informal basis. I should like to put forward some ideas on how that could be done.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 614</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in a helpful frame of mind. I am sorry that there is no one here from the Scottish National party to comment on the hon. Gentleman's first point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not criticise the SNP.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman must not get excited. The SNP advocates non-payment. As the hon. Gentleman recognises the responsibility of Members of Parliament to advocate that people should pay their bills, it would have been interesting to make that contrast. I am not implying that the SNP is involved in Makerfield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not involved in politics anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not involved in the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a second point about the availability of lists in various places. In replying to the hon. Member for Torfaen I may have misled the hon. Gentleman. If I implied that the valuation list will not be available in valuation offices, may I correct that impression: it will be, but it will be helpful if it is also in local authority offices, because people are more familiar with them.<br><br>
I shall consider whether there are other public places where draft valuation lists could be made available, but I take the point that accessibility is important and I agree that the more guidance that we can offer on how errors in the draft can be remedied, the more helpful that will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition's dilemma is that, although we do not think much of the council tax, and think even less of the valuation banding proposals, it is our duty to improve Bills in Standing Committees. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) spoke about appeals and my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) said that information should be made more widely available, as is proposed in amendment No. 151, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Listing Officer shall… take such steps as he thinks most suitable for giving notice of it."</p></blockquote>
As the Minister has said that he will look again at the points made, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 615</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I expect that the Minister will say that the Labour party is again on the subject of individual valuations, but that is not what the amendment is about. It is simple. When and however the valuation is done, a house will be put in a band. I assume that the valuation officer will give the listing officer a value for that house. He will not say, "The value of that house is between £40,000 and £50,000." He will say, "That house is worth £43,000" or "The houses in that street are worth £43,000, except that house, which is worth £47,000, but they all come into one band." The amendment would ensure that the list gives the value of the house as well as the band it is in. That will ease part of the administrative nightmare that the banding system will create.<br><br>
My house in Scotland would probably be placed in band F—values exceeding £80,000—but it would only just fall into that band, in common with all the houses of a certain type in my street. The residents would assume that we were at the bottom of that band because our houses were valued at £80,500 or £81,000 and every one of us would appeal. However, if my house were placed in band E because it had been valued at £90,000, as stated on one list, I should be less likely to appeal against the banding—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not equally likely that the publication of a value for every property—in Scotland it is rumoured that they look after the bawbees very tightly—would encourage every person to appeal? People may feel that reducing the value by a few thousand pounds would not affect the present band but would give them a better start in a subsequent band-shifting in a few years' time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting comment. Kind though the hon. Gentleman is for giving me lifts home, he has not been listening to our debate on banding and valuation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be walking tonight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am going home on the sleeper tonight. I do not want to fall into the trap set by my hon. Friend the member for Leyton, who talked about birthdays and so on.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 616</span>
The hon. Member for Wyre has not been listening. The Minister has made it clear that, in the vast majority of cases, houses will be in their bands in perpetuity. There will be no point in shifting a valuation from £90,000 to £85,000 if the house will not change bands.<br><br>
We are saying that the valuation of the property decided by the valuer should be put alongside the banding. If valuers are not to put a value on each property, the process will be terrifying. The valuer will merely say, "Ah, that house comes within the £40,000 to £50,000 or within the £80,000 to £100,000 range." Why have the Government published the Domestic Property (Valuation) (Scotland) Regulations 1991, SI 2022, which stipulate the assumptions that valuers must make when carrying out valuations? The assumptions include:
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) that the sale was with vacant possession;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) that the property was sold free from any heritable security".</p></blockquote>
There is also this interesting assumption:
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) that the property was in a state of reasonable repair".</p></blockquote>
How will the valuer know that if he just goes along the street and looks at the properties?<br><br>
I told my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) that in Scotland a good phrase often used about middle-class ladies is that they are all fur coats and nae knickers. That means that they spend all their money on outward display and none—</span></p>
