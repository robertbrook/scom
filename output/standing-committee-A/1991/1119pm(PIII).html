	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee. To debate anything at this time of the morning is absurd. We have passed 12.30 a.m. and are long past cocoa time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend keep going for a little longer while I am out getting him a cup of cocoa?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore my Friend's intervention because an inexplicable animation comes over hon. Members after 11 p.m. The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson), for whom I have a great deal of time, seemed to come alive at about 11.30, almost like Dracula's daughter. I withdraw that remark—it is grossly unfair to the hon. Lady, who is not at all like that. However, she did come alive, as did the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie). This is the land of the living dead. Tomorrow never comes for this Committee. As soon as we reach tomorrow, the next day of the Committee begins and we never see the light of day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 13 December 1990, in Standing Committee F, we were debating the Community Charges (Substitute Setting) Bill. The Minister reminded me of it with his kindly remarks this morning. He said some nattering things about me which embarrassed me in front of my hon. Friends, who did not know that I resembled Father Christmas. In that Committee, we suggested that a breathing space to review the Government's proposals on the poll tax would be opportune. At that time we could have examined jointly how to abolish the poll tax by April 1992. We said then that the Bill was unacceptable, ill-conceived, unworkable and irrelevant to the needs of poll tax payers. I think the same of this Bill as I did of the Bill that became the Community Charges (Substitute Setting) Act 1991; it is the wrong Bill at the wrong time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could provide an immediate, sensible solution by amending clause 2. As we shall debate valuation proposals at greater length in clause 5,1 shall curtail my remarks, emphasising only that amendment No. 19 would provide a proper valuation system that takes account of individual property, assesses the worth of that property, takes account of the environment in which it is placed and gives people a
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
basis on which to judge their relevant household payments. That would be much more acceptable than the banding proposals which are included for the sole purpose of avoiding the fair rates solution. There can be no other reason for dreaming up the eight bands and placing households, or dwellings, in a system that permits estate agents to pick out particular sample properties in one locality and then fit the properties of everyone else into the banding system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not deal with the regional disparities because we shall discuss them later; suffice it to say that no one could have dreamt up a system that would cause such anomalies if he had not been in a desperate hurry and had not wanted to avoid the sensible solution of his political opponents. The proposals will mean that someone could be placed in the same band as someone else in the same street, even though his property is worth a very different amount from the sampled property. It does not take a genius to know that a house next door to a discotheque is worth less than one at the other end of the street overlooking a quiet local park—even though the property may be the same sort of semi-detached house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such an anomaly will be repeated up and down Britain and so will cause havoc for the appeals system, which will not be triggered until early 1993. That will mean terrible difficulties for the appeals process and for local authorities dealing with people who feel aggrieved about the band on which their property has been placed. That band could result in their being charged a amount similar to those whose properties are valued £20,000 higher or lower.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asserts that many people will wish to appeal under a broad-based banding system. Under the Government's proposals at least, people's only basic gripe could be that they disagree about the band into which their property should fall. If I have kept awake and heard correctly, the proposals of the hon. Gentleman's party seem to define a system that would have at least four criteria for the ultimate valuation of property. Obviously, that would be much more complex than the Governmen's proposals and so would lead to an infinitely greater number of opportunities for individuals to appeal against the initial decision on their properties. That would be farcical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to stop the hon. Gentleman having a sleep. Whatever bad dreams he had on that occasion could be no worse than those of people who wake up and discover that the council tax will do to them. A rateable value that applies to the premises and is exclusive to the particular circumstances of that property and its environment would make more sense to people. It would also be seen as fair in relation to other properties in the street, especially as the Bill proposes that the valuation made, and the band in which the property is placed, will remain in perpetuity unless a renovation to the property triggers a change in its valuation banding when it is sold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that I was awake. The hon. Gentleman's answer has reinforced my scepticism about the workability of his scheme. To introduce subjective concepts such as local environment, which is dependent on the opinion of those living in each property, would open a Pandora's box of subjective judgment on different criteria about the rateable value of a property. To introduce such criteria would make millions of long, drawn-out appeals far
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
more likely than they would be under a broad band of property values. The small number of appeals would be based on only one clear, objective criterion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would that the hon. Gentleman's words turn out to be true. When people recognise the anomalies involved and realise the difficulties that they face, the limited appeals that the hon. Gentleman mentioned will look more like the wonderful haven of a Sunday school outing than the nightmare that will follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, people want a stable rateable value that does not vary greatly with changes in property prices. We believe that while capital values should be the basis of the proposal, they should be based on real values, assessed as they have been for years by professional valuers. They were under enormous constraints in Scotland in 1985 when they were asked to do an impossible job with notional rental values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have come a long way since then; it is a pity that the Government decided not to accept the changing perspective and to reject the professional advice offered. The Institute of Revenue, Rating and Valuation made it abundantly clear that proposals that dream up a valuation system—the banding system has been dreamt up for a particular purpose—have no bearing on ability to pay. That is what a valuation system should seek to achieve. It is nothing more or less than a way of assessing the payments that should be made according to people's income and the type of property in which they live, varied by a sensible and more progressive rebate system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is what we are trying to achieve and it is why we object to the council tax. If that tax were straightforward, simple and fair, there would be no question of our rejecting the banding system as a solution, because our objective is to help to get rid of the poll tax at the earliest opportunity. However, the banding system is neither fair nor practicable, and it will not be simple. As a consequence, people will vent their disillusion on the politicians who impose it and upon the local government system, which has already taken the kind of battering that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) has faced during the past two and a half hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that one of my hon. Friends has a mug of cocoa for me in the Corridor but under the rules of the House he is not allowed to bring it into the Room. I shall therefore bring my remarks to a conclusion so that I can refresh myself for the next bout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is drinking his cocoa, may I point out that amendment No. 14 relates to the Scottish clause 17? It would have the same affect as the amendment No. 11, as it would remove the banding system. I emphasise that the Labour Party is opposed to banding: we believe that every property should be individually valued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends who represent English and Welsh constituencies will not mind if I point out that it is easier to make the case for individual valuations in Scotland than in England and Wales because in Scotland the system has worked that way for many years. The last full revaluation was in 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
I accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside that at the time the assessors worked under the strict limitation of looking only at the so-called rentable value of each property. However, I understand from assessors involved in that valuation that they took into account exactly the points that we suggest in our fair rates policy. They looked at the capital value, the insurance aspect and other relevant matters, including the situation of the house in a certain area and how it compared with other houses in the same road. A house next to a disco, a gas works or a playing field was valued at less than an identical house next to a beautiful park. That is the legitimate way to make valuations. Buyers and sellers know the difference in valuations between such houses, so it is right that every house should have an individual valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assessors in Scotland assure us that they could not undertake an individual valuation by 1st April 1993, but they have up-to-date valuation rolls for 1989. Those could be brought back into play and new and altered properties added. Although that task would take time, the Scottish assessors believe that after a Labour Government comes to power in May or June 1992, the assessors could have an up-to-date valuation roll ready for use on 1st April 1993. I admit that if the Government are so desperate that they hold on until July the assessors' task will be more difficult, but even at that date they maintain that they can do it. Thereafter, a full and proper revaluation of all properties in Scotland could be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individual valuations would override the problems of banding raised by Tory Members with London constituencies. The spectrum of property values is almost the same in every local authority; valuations may start at a higher point but they go to an even higher point. The problem with the Government's banding system is that in some areas almost all properties will be in the top two or three bands. The Government's proposals do not have the spread required for a proper taxation system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) suggested that there would be few appeals under the banding system. The 1985 revaluation in Scotland caused enormous problems and there were several appeals, but they have all been dealt with to the satisfaction of the appellants. Very few people took their appeal to court, which they had a right to do. Appeals have not been extended over an enormous number of years. They can be dealt with satisfactorily under the system that operates in Scotland, and it could continue to operate on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research done by, I believe, Glasgow university shows that, on the basis of the banding system, one third of all properties will be just below or just above—£2,000 either way—of each band. It is a mistake to believe that only those put into the band above will appeal. Someone who wishes to sell a house may appeal against a banding that is too low because a prospective purchaser may say, "You are trying to sell this house for £65,000, but it is in the £55,000 band. So why are you trying to do me out of £10,000?" There may very well be appeals both ways. Individual valuation gets rid of some grave anomalies. It has been pointed out to me that if I thought that the council tax was here to stay, I should go to a nice holiday island such as Arran—the Under-Secretary of State knows that I holiday there—find a ruin, and buy it for £4,000 or £5,000, which would put it into the lowest band. I could then spend a fortune on it. I could build on another four bedrooms, instal an indoor heated swimming pool, a sauna and a Jacuzzi. I could do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
anything that I wanted because that property would remain in the bottom band of local taxation until I sold it. Is it not absurd that one can increase the value of a property 100-fold or 200-fold, but that it still remains within the lowest tax band?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if he owns a property that needs work done on it, he will be penalised under the system that he suggests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman would care to read the documentation that we have issued, he will see that certain home improvements will not increase the value of a property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Socially desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly right. Central heating, double glazing, a new roof or other energy-saving devices will not increase the value of the property and cause it to attract higher taxation. But if three bedrooms or another dining room are added to a house, they should be taken into account in terms of valuation and increased tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems clear from the standard of interventions from Conservative Members that they do not have an anwer to my hon. Friend's point about someone who improves a property out of all recognition, increasing its value perhaps 10-fold and even more. If Conservatives Members have an answer to that point, I should like to hear it right now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will notice a profound silence from Conservative Members. They do not have an answer. The banding system simply does not take account of this sort of anomaly, although I am not saying that it will occur often. For a second home, the owner will find it worth remembering that he will also get 50 per cent. off the bottom band. That makes the situation even more ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have an answer, but I have a question. The hon. Gentleman has painted an interesting but rather silly scenario of someone buying a house for about £5,000 and doing so much work on it that it becomes worth £200,000, moving it right up the bands. How many such examples does the hon. Gentleman know of and how many does he expect? Surely he is not suggesting that that is a representative case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always keen to encourage the tourist industry in Scotland, where Tory Members of Parliament are treated as a tourist attraction because they are an endangered species. If the hon. Gentleman goes to the west of Scotland or any of the holiday areas, he will see that there are a considerable number of places which have been developed to the extent that I mentioned. People are coming from London to Scotland to build houses or redevelop buts and bens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had understood from Ministers on Second Reading that the anomaly does not exist because if someone improves his house and its value increases, the house will not move up into the next band until a new owner buys the house and becomes the person for whom the tax is set. Unlike the Labour party's roof tax proposal, the council tax does not mean that people have a disincentive to improve their home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making my point for me. I do not know where he has been for the past five minutes. My point is that under the council tax people can improve their property and its value by an enormous amount and still pay the lowest possible tax. [Hon. Members: "So what?"] Well we believe that people should contribute to local government services whether they are second home owners or first-time buyers. If they improve their properties, that should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individual valuations are the best way forward. The example of Scotland shows that they can be done; and we have the expertise in Scotland to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, when applied to Scotland, the banding and valuation systems show that the Scottish Office is being driven by the Department of the Environment, rather than thinking in Scottish terms, about Scotland's local government and interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two issues before us—whether we should have banding and what we should do with banding if we have it. I understand perfectly from earlier debates that the Labour Party opposes our use of banding. We use the banding system to compress the rates of tax. I disagree fundamentally with the Labour Party's view about that. I believe that the sympathies of the British people are with the Government on that point. However, our use of banding is a separate issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It surprises me that the Labour Party opposes banding 	<i>per se</i> as a technique for administratively simplifying valuations. A quote from "Fair Rates" was read out in Committee earlier. I shall not base my entire case on that, lest any Opposition Member interrupts me. "Fair Rates" mentions making rolling revaluations each year after the new register is established, and suggests using a banding system to achieve that. The Labour Party admits in that document that banding is neither evil nor wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) was interviewed after he made a speech to the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation. I tread with some caution, because he was quoted in the local government press and later protested in a letter that he had been misquoted. However, he did not stick rigidly to Labour's proposals for four different valuation schemes. I believe that he described himself as open to persuasion on the matter. He was asked what would happen if the Bill were passed and a Labour Government elected. I believe that he said that the Labour Party would have to consider carefully whether to continue to use the council tax as a base, obviously as a second-best option. However, a Labour Government is an unlikely prospect, and one should not place too much weight on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Labour Party has carefully considered banded property valuation. It is simpler than providing individual valuations for each property down to the last pound. What benefit would accrue from valuing individual property to the last pound, especially for a tax that would raise just 15 per cent. of local government spending in England, 11 per cent. in Scotland and 8 per cent. in Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When small amounts of money are raised, even on a banded system, the difference between band A and band B is small, even which the difference in valuation between those bands is £12,000. For example, the council tax, under standard spending, for two adults will be £311 in England for a house that is worth up to £52,000, and £267 for a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
house worth up to £40,000. The difference is modest. Is it worth the extra trouble to sort out a different rate of tax for every pound difference in valuation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has rightly set out to examine the practicality of the Bill and the proposed tax, and the simplicity and good administrative sense of our proposals. It is not worth chasing after the last pound of valuation in each property when the distinctions between the tax rate for properties in the different bands are modest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can hardly believe what I am hearing. Has the Minister learnt nothing from the experience of the poll tax? In terms of the total size of bills, the poll tax may well be dismissed on the grounds—as cited by the Minister—of being a relatively small sum. Nevertheless, the sum was important enough and the difference between what people were led to believe they would pay and the bills that actually materialised was perceived as so significant that law-abiding communities rioted in the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must surely be able to understand that the minor differences, which he dismisses so easily, amount to increases of 20, 30, 40 or 50 per cent. in the bills that people expect or that they see other people paying. Can he not grasp that although those sums may be small to him, with his Minister's salary, they are vital to literally millions of people? He is being far too cavalier. I have a great regard for the Minister; usually he understands well these matters and has a good grasp of the issues, but he is surely not saying that the differences are so small that it really does not matter whether such a crude and simple measure is used. That cannot be his position, but if it is, I beg him to abandon it straight away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Labour party has misunderstood. It seems to believe that because an important argument in favour of banding is that it will often be possible to conduct the valuation easily and cheaply by examining a row of terraced houses and deciding that they fall within the same band, the Government have said at some time that houses that look alike, even though their circumstances may be different, will be ascribed the same valuation and be pushed into the same band. We have never said any such thing. The system will be based on market capital values. The market capital values of a two-bedroomed terraced house that overlooks a beautiful park and that of a similar house adjacent to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
smelly gas works are likely to be different. They may possibly, but not necessarily, be so different that the houses end up in different bands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the Bill and nothing in what Ministers have said means that houses with different market values must go into the same band because somebody thinks that they look alike. That is a gross exaggeration of the different point that we have made that, self-evidently, within one area or street many houses will be similar, thereby enabling valuers to make a quick and cost-effective valuation that will not require an intrusion into homes to discover whether someone has central heating and should be charged another few pounds in taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister realise that it is possible that, in a street where all the houses have a similar frontage and general appearance and look alike from outside, within the houses, the flat sizes may vary from six bedrooms to one bedroom?

No valuer will guess at the size of flats from the outside. Valuers will be equipped with information about the size of hereditaments within a building containing a number of flats. The hon.

One of the important innovations that we are introducing with the council tax valuation is the use of the widest variety of informed, expert management with detailed knowledge of the local situation. We are not just leaving it to the valuation office, which has one type of information; we are inviting tenders from the private sector and from local expert valuers who know the local scene well. Those local valuers will be provided by the valuation office with the information that the valuation office has on properties in the area. The valuation office will also be responsible for ensuring that the valuations delivered by different valuers are consistent. That is one or the reasons why the valuation will take place during this winter and coming spring and yet we shall not publish the draft valuation lists until the end of 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The advantage of a banding system is that the valuation can be carried out more quickly and efficiently and the valuation is more likely to last longer. There has been some misinformation supplied on that subject during the debate, but unlike the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) I do not jump up every time I hear something that I think is incorrect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for revaluations should they be required. If properties are allocated to bands and if the valuations share the same starting date, which is April 1991, it stands to reason that more properties will remain longer in the appropriate band than if the valuation were done on a pound-for-pound basis. That applies whatever is happening in the property market because the bands are merely an expression of relative movements in the values of properties in different places. It seems likely that cheaper properties will continue to remain in band A and that more expensive properties will remain in band F and band G for as far ahead as one can see. However, the Bill provides for revaluations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the banding system removes the disincentive to make home improvements which would exist under a rating system? The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) raised a fair and serious point about a ruin on Arran, but the money invested in that ruin does no more than make it habitable. It is money invested in the local economy and environment. That investment is realised only when the owner sells the property. It is perfectly acceptable to improve a ruin—to put a roof on it and to make it habitable so that it can survive another century and more. It will be revalued when it is sold, because that is the time that the owner will benefit form his investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. That was the low point of the Labour party's contributions to the debate. Labour Members have included many of the elements of previous Labour party arguments such as the envy tax. The idea that home improvements should not go untaxed is typical of the Labour party's view that all taxation should be based on envy; if someone has done a little better for himself, he should be penalised for it. I shudder again for the Labour
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
party during the election when people are told that the merest improvement to their home will be punished by the almost immediate imposition of a new tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr Bowis) notice the absurdity of some suggestions? It was suggested that the value of a house could be increased twentyfold. I do not know how many of my hon. Friends saw the Beatles film "Help", showing the Beatles all living in a terraced street. The neighbours believe that the Beatles have been unspoilt by their success because they still live in terraced houses, but as they go through their four individual doors, the inside is revealed to be a lavish palace, The Labour party is suggesting that the value of a terraced house somewhere could be increased twentyfold. I think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) suggest that figure. It reminded me of the comment this morning by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that people who lived in £200,000 or £300,000 houses were probably millionaires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has made the most absurd and farfetched case as a pretext for attacking our sensible proposal that one should not have to pay for the improvement of a property until it is sold. The Bill also provides for the value of a property being reduced because of a change in its surroundings. For example, the construction of a motorway or a council dump may materially reduce its value. The owner may then apply for a downward valuation of the band in which property falls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart produced another absurdity. He suggested that if people sold their property at a value different from that at which it had been valued in 1991, it would affect the band to which that property would be allocated. That is untrue. The value of a property as of April 1991 is the relevant value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister's comments on banding. I have considered the band span of band B-£40,000 to £52,000. A banding, once established, is supposed to reflect the approximate value of the property involved. It is impossible greatly to increase the value of smaller, inner-city houses—though inner-city houses are not always small—by modernising them. The Minister said that banding is sensible because it reflects the value of a property, but he has now told us that banding will not reflect a property's value because it will not take account of improvements. Why bother with banding if it is so crude and unrealistic a measure of a property's true value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a crude and unrealistic measure. We are trying to establish what properties were worth in April 1991. That will take account of the individual circumstances of properties. If an enormous extension has been built at the back of a house, the value of that house may well be different from that of a house without such an extension. Extensions can be discovered through the existence of planning applications, aerial photography or the information that local valuers have about properties. Those are the elements of the trade of expert valuers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once a band has been established in April 1991, we shall not penalise people for further improving their property thereafter. The April 1991 valuation must take account of the features of the property that are relevant to its market value.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unclear about the Minister's remarks about the right to seek revaluation or rebanding on the grounds of an environmental impact assessment. That is vital in mining communities. Long-term opencast proposals have a great impact on the environment and most such proposals are approved by the Department of the Environment. What will happen when the Department of the Environment approves large-scale opencasting after April 1991? Such mining will be greatly detrimental to the value of thousands of houses. That will be especially true of opencast developments of 250,000 to 1 million tonnes that will last between seven and 10 years, with a further seven years of refurbishment after that. Mining communities are increasingly affected by large-scale opencast developments. Will the Government, in the case of severe environmental impact from such developments, allow banding arrangements to be amended to take account of those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes—I have already mentioned that matter. Although I did not give the example of opencast mining, I said that if a motorway or smelly gas works were built next to the property, that would materially affect its market value and the owner could apply for the property to be downgraded into a lower band.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person lives in a terraced house that is in band A—the lowest band—and the Department of Transport decides to improve the A1 which runs alongside his house, what happens if he asks for his property to be downgraded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the house is in band A, it is in the lowest band; a house cannot be in a band lower than the lowest band, so there is nothing that the owner can do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Logically, in the same way as there should be a maximum that any person contributes through the council tax to local authority services, so there should be a minimum in terms of the band into which a property falls. However, in a local authority such as Wandsworth there is no minimum to what a house owner may pay, because at present no local taxation is payable in Wandsworth as a result of that local authority's wise policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Band A is the lowest band and represents the lowest contribution that people, in general, should make, so there is no scope for reducing the value of a property that falls out of the A band. In England band A is from nought to £40,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention was longer than a speech. When I gave way to the Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) intervened to help me. I have not finished my contribution yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
The overwhelming majority of housing in the United Kingdom will fall into the lower bands. The Government's assessment is that 55 per cent. of houses in my area will fall into that category. That means that most houses affected by a severe environmental impact will not be able to take advantage of the Government's proposals for downgrading. The proposals represent meaningless access into a lower band for those in the very areas where environmental devastation is to take place. The fact that no subsidiary legislation has been proposed to cover that, is a serious omission. If the Minister is serious about providing access between bands to rectify a severe, adverse, environmental impact, he should bear in mind those areas where such problems are likely to arise because most of the people there will be living in houses that are already in the lowest band.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a century of mining in Wigan and there will be at least another quarter century of opencast mining. Householders in such places will be paying large council tax bills but will have no possible redress when their environment deteriorates further. The Minister is living in a fool's paradise if he does not realise that people will see it as completely unfair if someone in Redbridge, Surrey gets a huge rebate because a road link through the town is planned but someone living in a mining community who has to put up with large-scale industrial blight will not receive a new assessment. In many instances people have had to put up with almost a decade of destruction and despoliation of the hinterland around thousands of houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider, to consult organisations such as the Coalfield Communities Campaign and to take account of the proposal's effect on many communities in the United Kingdom. As drafted, the measure will mean a raw deal for people living in those properties on which there will be the biggest environmental impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make only one comment about the banding and how it will work. The Minister said that similar houses in the same street will fall into the same band.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, houses will probably fall into the same band. It is on that basis that the Minister calls the banding system fair. What would happen if house prices were rising rapidly? They are not rising now, because of the Government's policy on interest rates, but they have done so in the past. In such circumstances, identical properties in the same street could be sold at different times, and their valuations would affect the banding. They would be placed in different bands where they were sold. Neighbours will ask their Members of Parliament, "How can this be fair?" That is what I ask the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be extremely unfair, but that is not what is proposed. Properties will be valued on what they were worth in April 1991. The price at which they sell in September 1991, August 1993 or any other date has nothing to do with the case. What matters is their value in April 1991. Confusion may have arisen because I said that the one exception to that rule is a house that is improved to the extent that it alters its band and is sold: it will be revalued. Let us suppose that such a house is sold in August 1993. It will be revalued not for what it is worth in August

1993 but for what it would have been worth in April 1991 had it then had, for example, an extension. I apologise if I confused the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen).

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last revelation was significant: the further away from April 1991 the more technically difficult and logically absurd will become the process of judging the material improvement to a property of whose initial value remains as it was in April 1991. The further away from April 1991, the more difficult it will become for valuers. This will cause great aggravation and be the subject of appeals because people will view what is happening to them with a very jaundiced eye. To put the valuation of property across Britain on a level playing field—I believe that that is the latest phase—will be a technical and professional impossibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, we shall need to explore the matter further because there is a new joker in the pack. I thought that in-flight valuations were enough for one sitting, but we appear to have moved on still further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 1,790 packages of valuations will be sent in batches of 10,000 and 20,000 to estate agents. Estate agents can only tick the boxes accordingly to the known evidence of some samples. The valuations are made according to the samples and not the bands and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has remarked on several occasions, the bands are crude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) has commented that, in some parts of England—I shall treat Scotland and Wales as separate— the band range £0-£40,000 encompasses very different properties, of widely varying value and nature, and occupants in very different circumstances. That is the crudeness of the arrangements.

I withdraw the amendment because it is late, because the Committee will return to this point when it discusses clause 5 and because we have so much to think about and explore.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cause 2 is about daily liability. If a discount system is imposed on a property valuation system it makes the assessment and administration of that daily liability almost impossible. The whole discount system is based on a misunderstanding of how to help those in need of assistance with paying their bills. We can only presume that Conservative members have no intention of linking substantial sums of money to ease people's bills with the financial circumstances of the people whose bills need easing. The Governement intend to provide a discount based on political opportunism rather than on the ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount will give people who happen to live alone,—that is a particular circumstance at a given moment—a 25 per cent. reduction in their bills merely because they happen to live alone, not because they cannot afford to pay, or because they are in straitened circumstances, or even because of their age. They may have retired and lived in their house for a long time. A millionaire who has lived in a penthouse suite for a year will be entitled to a 25 per cent. discount. The banding system and its compression, coupled with a 25 per cent. discount, could reduce a millionaire's bill below that of an average family who live in a semi-detached house and are placed in the band below the millionaire's. The beneficiary is not necessarily someone who needs the money, but someone who happens to live alone. It is an absurd system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount system is not to be confused with the rebate system, which ensures that people receive relief according to their means: 100 per cent. for those who need it, a taper for those who need some help. It is not based on the fact that people might have lived in a property for a long time. They might be retired and need some protection because a substantial change in their circumstances is not reflected by the value of the property. A rebate system could include substantial disregards for retired people. That is a simple method of operating the system. It has worked in previous rebate systems, but perhaps not to the extent that we would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose a discount sytem that is based solely on the status of the individual—a single-person discount, for instance. The discount scheme will cost the nation £780 million. That money could, through a rebate system, substantially change the help available to those who need it. It could improve disregards; comprehensively deal with the 20 per cent. contribution rule and alleviate the suffering it causes, and tackle the administrative difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These difficulties have been underestimated. Preparing and updating a database on a discount system has already been described by those in the field as an almost impossible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
task. People who are experienced in such matters claim that any personal head count will cause administrative difficulties and extreme expense. The Audit Commission has declared that property turn over effectively precludes that option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission carried out a study between December 1989 and August 1990 of poll tax variations and the difficulties of chasing those who moved house. The Audit Commission discovered that 30 per cent. of the population moved properties during that time. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham pointed out earlier, 40 per cent. of the population in London moved in that period. It is believed that as many as 40 per cent. of households in inner London are single-person households. That figure reaches 50 per cent. in some of the most deprived inner London Boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures show that formulating and maintaining a discount list is very difficult. It would, perhaps, mean using a register. There are no Secretaries of State in Committee whom we can hold to account for the decisions that they pass down to their Ministers. I therefore quote the Secretary of State for Scotland, who said on 6 November during consideration of the Queen's Speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is all the differences in the world between a register and a list. A register is a statutory designated body"—</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that he meant that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that is a basis for designating liability. A list is a source of administrative efficiency for the use of the local authority."—[Official Report, 6 November 1991; Vol. 198, c. 540.]</p></blockquote>

That is the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, the difference between a register and a list is that a list is like going out shopping for soap powder and margarine and taking them off the shelves. This is fascinating stuff. It is also extremely unfair on those of us who have to work out our own shopping lists, sometimes with a little help, given the hours that we spend in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all know the difference. A register takes account of people moving on a very large scale. It takes account of the people who live in the properties, their relationship with each other and whether they are telling the truth when they say they live alone—or whether there is someone else there who disappears when the list or— register is being compiled. It does not matter what it is called: it is a register if there has to be a record—perhaps we could call it a record—of those who live in a particular dwelling at a particular time on a particular day, because the assessment will be made on a daily basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fortuitous for the Government that we are debating this issue at 1.45 in the morning, because were we doing so at a more reasonable hour, light might be shed across Britain about what the discount scheme means. The scheme will certainly mean something when it comes into practice.
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
If, God forbid, the Government win the general election, the discounts scheme will be imposed and people will soon find that the promise of a 25 per cent. discount in theory turns out to be an anomalous nightmare that will cause aggravation within as well as between different households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount scheme also causes great problems in its interface with the rebate scheme. We will come across cases such as that of a student married to someone who looks after his small children at home. The student is entitled to the student status discount. His wife's parents, who own the house, live with the couple, and one of them is the head of the household. If the student moves into a hostel or student residence down the road, he pays nothing, but the people whom he was previously supporting find that not only that their discount eligibility but that their rebate eligibility changes. That is the kind of issue that we shall want to explore in the weeks ahead—if we have time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking to four amendments, three of which relate to England and one to Scotland. Amendments Nos. 12, 20 and 21 suggest an alternative, but amendment No. 15, which is the equivalent of amendment No. 12 affecting the English and Welsh provisions, is not accompanied by any reference to a rebate scheme for Scotland. Does that imply some distinction in the Labour party's policy towards Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain why. Rebate schemes are the responsibility of the Department of Social Security, which deals with the United Kingdom. Any amendments to the English part of the Bill that were relevant to that Department would also apply to Scotland. If the hon. Member for Battersea is so stupid as to suggest that that is not so, it is long past the time when he should have gone to bed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is long past the time when all of us should have gone to bed.

Who supports the discount system, apart from Conservative Members? The professional bodies do not. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy generously suggested that any fairness in the valuation system would be cancelled out by the application of the discount system alongside it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the disappearing voters—the million people who disappeared from the recent census because of problems with the poll tax register? Those people will presumably not appear on the register, list or whatever we call it. People will soon learn that one person in a dwelling, irrespective of whether that person is eligible for a status discount, has to be registered in order to apply for a discount. People are not daft. This will encourage people to sell their vote for a discount on their tax. That is dangerous. Unfortunately, as the poll tax has shown, people will take that opportunity and that will distort accountability and the democratic system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anomalies in the status discount and the interface with the rebate system must be exposed. We must protect people from the unfairness that is built into the discount system. At a better hour, we must show what nonsense the legislation is. It is designed solely to maintain a semblance of the poll tax. Discounts are unnecessary under a fair property valuation system abated by a sensible rebate scheme. That is what we propose and it is what people will vote for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) said, amendment No. 15 relates to the equivalent Scottish clause. As I pointed out, the other amendments apply to Department of Social Security rebate systems, which apply across the United Kingdom. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman took the point and sorry that he had to ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hour is late and this situation is absurb. I oppose guillotine motions, but their advantage is that they do allow hon. Members to go home early. We have the worst of both worlds; a guillotine motion that curtails debate and the need to stay late. Why are we doing it? It must relate to what will happen in the other place when the Bill reaches it. The peers will expect us to have given the Bill due consideration and to have put in sufficient hours to warrant their not holding up the Bill. That is an absurd reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) has put many of the arguments against the discount. I shall deal with one that was put earlier—the idea that single people should receive a discount because they use fewer local government services. I have heard that argument from Tories for a considerable time. I object to it as a system of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not believe that taxation should be related as such to the service that is paid for by that particular piece of taxation. We do not do that in national taxation and we should not do it in local taxation. As a principle, taxation should be based on ability to pay as far as possible. Before the Liberal Democrats jump in and say that that means a local income tax—although at this time of night, I doubt that they will be jumping at all—let me say that if a tax is imposed, it should be paid for and whether services are provided should not be related to that particular tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that all single people living alone do not make extensive use of local services. An example which springs to mind is that of the youngish widow with four children at school who all use the education and related services. She will get a discount under the council tax and, in certain circumstances, will be entitled to 100 per cent rebate. The example of the elderly widow is most often used when discussing this matter. The argument is that she does not use the local services as much as the family next door does. That is simply not true. A family of four adults who no longer use the education system, are in employment and do not use the social services do not make use of the services as often as or as much as an elderly person who may have a home help and who may feel a greater need for police protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that single people use services less than people in families does not stand up to close examination as a principle of taxation or in practical application. I hope that Conservative Members will not use that as an argument regarding discounts either now or later in our discussions. The discount system is a broad-brush approach to solve a specific problem. One third of households are single households. That means that 66 per cent of all households are basically paying a property tax and nothing else and, therefore, only one third are paying, or getting back, the personal element or the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many of the one third of single households will receive 100 per cent. rebates? Can the Government tell us? If they are removed from the calculation, a small number of people will be left and so we shall be using a blunderbluss to try to solve what is essentially a small problem. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
means that the millionaire living alone in his penthouse gets enormous benefits whereas the couple just out of the rebate system, living in a council house, are the losers, that cannot be right under any taxation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make too much of technicalities, but let me point out to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that his suggestion to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) that amendments Nos. 20 and 21, which would replace the word "discount" with the word "rebate", would apply to Scotland as well as to England and Wales because the Department of Social Security is a United Kingdom Department is nonsense. Clause 117 makes it clear that part I applies only to England and Wales and clause 2 is included in part I. Once again, we have a policy difference between Scotland and England or, arguably, simply the normal kind of drafting error that is often made by the Opposition because they do not have the resources to bring forward technically accurate amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As someone trying to draft Scottish amendments, I feel that it is increasingly futile because I know that the amendments will be tagged on at the end of the English debate. To table piles of amendments that will be tagged on the end of another debate is a futile exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is reasonable for the honourable Gentleman, given his position, to say that he cannot always table technically accurate amendments, the Opposition often tables an amendment as a peg on which to hang a debate. However, the honourable Gentleman was wrong to suggest that his amendments covered the point to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of discussion is personal discounts and not status discounts. Status discounts are covered by amendment No. 17 to schedule 1 which would abolish the status discount. The council tax will solve, through the personal discounts, one of the unfairest aspects of the rates—the inability to regognise that it was unreasonable to expect a single-person household to make the same contribution to the cost of providing local authority services as a household with two or more adults, that is the essential differences between Conservative and Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ensure that all the youngish widows of my acquaintance receive a copy of the speech of the honourable Members for Cathcart. They will not view it as sympathetic. The amendments would make the benefits system cope with the problem, the benefits system exists to help people with low incomes, the purpose of the discount system is different. It is not related to income. We believe that it is unreasonable in principle to expect a single-person household to contribute as much as a household with two or more adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party proposes a rebate system that would help single persons, among others, only up to a certain level of income. The Labour party and the hon. Member for Cathcart are saying to the widow who has an income above that level, "Get out of your house if you cannot afford the rates bill for it." That is the hon. Gentleman's position. The Labour party has no concern for the fact that that house may be the widow's home where she has lived with her family that the widow probably makes little use of local services. The Labour party says that if she lives in a big
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
house she can afford to pay large amounts of tax as a matter of principle. That is the difference of policy between the Labour party and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not a Labour Member who, describing the people who should receive housing benefit, said that people should not live in houses that were too large for their needs, it was the then Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish by saying that the discounts will provide well-targeted help to many single pensioners and others living on their own. The discounts will not require complex procedures, nor will there be a need for a register, as my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) pointed out. Those who wish to apply for a discount will need only to tell the authority and all the authority will need to know is that those seeking a discount live on their own or with people who are disregarded for the purposes of the tax. It is a fair and feasible system and if the Labour party wishes to press a Division, I urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
