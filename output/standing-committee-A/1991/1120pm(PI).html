	<p>I have here a letter from the Serjeant at Arms, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was very disturbed to learn this morning of the loss from Committee Room 10 of some papers belonging to members of your Committee. As soon as they learned of the loss, my staff began a full search of the Palace waste paper system in order to try to retrieve the papers but I regret to tell you they have not been successful. I am very conscious of the inconvenience caused to Members by this lapse on the part of my staff and I should be very grateful if you would pass on my personal apologies to them for the inconvenience they have suffered.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Everything possible will be done to prevent a recurrence.</p></blockquote>"</p>
	<p>That is as much as the Serjeant at Arms and his staff could have done. I thank him for his letter.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before lunch, I was trying politely but forcibly to make the point that nurses should be treated equally under the Bill, to avoid a repetition of the difficulties that the poll tax caused for nursing students. Given that it has now been accepted that ability to pay should play some part in assessing liability for the council tax, it is difficult to understand the distinction that has been drawn between different groups of nursing students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I drew attention to how close the correlation was between the take-home pay of those employed in nursing schools directly by the health authorities and those studying under Project 2000. The deficits in terms of the average weekly income after tax and other deductions for nurses directly employed through health authorities was £96·83 and for those in Project 2000, it is £96·00—a difference of 83p. Despite the smallness, of that difference, under the Government's definition, 55,000 nursing students employed in the national health service will be treated differently from the 7,500 students currently in Project 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government take into account the nursing education reforms that are well under way? By the time that the Bill is implemented, a substantial number of the 55,000 nursing places that I have identified will have gone out of the system and will have been replaced by Project 2000 students. Will the Government accept the amendment and allow students to be treated equally under the Bill, irrespective of the way in which they gained access into the health service training scheme? If the Government do that, they will have the support of the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government reject the amendment, the nation will wonder why, given the billions of pounds that will be spent on rebates and other systems under the Bill, that group of nurses is being discriminated against. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, will he, at the very least, undertake to return to with an alternative proposal at a later stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by answering the question asked by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). Although it is not strictly relevant to clause 4, I am sure that it would be helpful to the Committee if I clarified the issue raised by the hon. Gentleman. He claimed that any exempt dwelling in Scotland becomes liable to non-domestic rates. That is not correct. Clause 73(4) provides for a property to go on to the valuation roll and, thus, to become liable for non-domestic rates when it ceases to be a dwelling, not when it becomes an exempt dwelling. I hope that I have clarified clause 73(4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where in the Scottish part of the Bill is there any mention of exempt dwellings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will realise that I am not dealing with Scottish matters, but simply trying to help him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have gone wide enough. The clue has been given; perhaps it could be pursued in a more regular way at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that giving the hon. Gentleman a helpful update.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 would limit the type of dwelling that may be prescribed as exempt. The word "limit" is important. The amendment gives my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State no discretion at all to exempt other types of dwelling. When we consulted on our proposals for the council tax, we said that any property that was subject to a standard community charge multiplier of zero should be exempted from the council tax. I confirm that that is still our intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed list does not go far enough. For example, it excludes dwellings that are empty following the death of the resident, or dwellings that are empty because they are undergoing structural repair to make them habitable. The list is clearly unacceptable and unduly restrictive. I urge the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) not to press those amendments. I hope that I have given him the assurances that he sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall not be able to give the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) the asssurances that he wanted regarding amendments Nos. 74, 30 and 53. Amendment No. 74 would require the Secretary of State to consider the need to exempt all students and student nurses
	<br><blockquote><p>"regardless of where they live".</p></blockquote>
The amendment was tabled following our undertaking to use clause 4 to exempt all properties occupied solely by students. We took that step because we recognised that students do not have access to the benefits system. The same is not true of student nurses. There is a clear and important difference between student nurses—who are employees of health authorities under the old system of training—and students on Project 2000 who are in receipt of bursaries. The latter, like university and other students in receipt of grants, are not eligible for social security benefits. Student nurses under the old system are entitled as employees of a health authority to benefits if their income allows. It is important to make that distinction clear, otherwise other students who—like student nurses—are employees on similar incomes would be treated differently from student nurses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point of the amendment is to avoid that. We are attempting to assist another Government Department which has changed the way in which people in the national health services are trained. We made it clear that the students should be taken on their own, as they would be out of the system after a time. Not long after the Bill is implemented, all students will come under Project 2000. We are not trying to link the Bill with other training schemes or other training allowances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not be attempting to link it, but that is the implication of the amendment. The hon. Gentleman is right: the old system of training nurses, under which they are employees of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
health service, is going out. Within the next few years, no nurses will be in training on the old system. Therefore, it is a diminishing problem. However, if we were to give special treatment to student nurses who are employees, we would create an anomaly against others on relatively low incomes in similar positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment, as it would create more problems than it would resolve. We are talking about the difference between those who are entitled to social security benefits, including student nurses on the present training system, and those who are not, such as university students and student nurses on Project 2000, the new training system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if I accept what the Minister says in good faith, it may cause further problems. If what the Minister said is correct, will he consider the possibility of introducing an amendment containing a negative arrangement? Irrespective of whether a person is classed as an employee or as participating in Project 2000, the income bands are identical. It is not right that one group of nurses will have a 100 per cent. exemption, while another group has only a 25 per cent. exemption. There must be a way for the Government to recognise that although income levels are identical, the use of the term "employee" will mean that a large group of nurses—55,000 of them—will have to meet an obligation that will not have to be met by Project 2000 nurses working alongside them. The Government must devise a negative arrangement so that both groups are treated in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not realised that that is exactly the position under the community charge. Students on Project 2000 are in a different position from student nurses who are employees of the NHS. If student nurses who are employees are on low income, they can get up to 100 per cent. rebate if they fall below income support level. That will continue. They are dealt with through the benefits system as employees. The others are students. There is a clear divide between those who are employees and are paid a salary, as are student nurses under the old system, and those who are student nurses receiving bursaries under the new training system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, how many of the 55,000 trainee nurses affected by the poll tax receive relief? If the Minister says that there is no difference, what is the position? Can he give us the figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea. The hon. Gentleman will have to table a question to Ministers in the Department of Social Security to obtain that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect, the Minister, in trying to defend himself, has made a bold assertion that those 55,000 nurses are helped within the system. Yet, when I ask him how many, he tells me to ask other Ministers. That is ridiculous. He has made an assertion, and I assume that he has in his brief the information to back up what he says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand that I am explaining the principle. The principle is that if a student nurse who is an employee under the present system has an income that is at income support level or below, she will be entitled to a rebate of up to 100 per cent. under the social security system. The hon. Gentleman cannot expect me, as a Minister who is not in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
the Department of Social Security, to carry in my head or on a piece of paper the answer to any question that he may ask about numbers. I suggest that, if he wants to find out whether that information is available, he table a parliamentary question to the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is clear and I cannot add much to what I have said. There is a clear distinction between those who are in full-time education at universities, polytechnics and elsewhere or are on Project 2000, and student nurses who, under the old system, are employees of the national health service working on the wards on shift systems and being paid a salary. A clear distinction must be made between those two groups. It will disappear over the next few years as the old system of student nurse education disappears and we go over to the classroom-based Project 2000 type of education where the student nurses get a bursary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments are entitled to operate legislation on such principles, because trying to make exceptions from those principles would have enormous consequences for people whose circumstances are similar to student nurses under the old training regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all recognise that these matters are difficult and complex, and that we are wandering into an area where it is not reasonable to expect the Minister to have great expertise. However, the Royal College of Nursing will be appalled when it hears of the Committee's work and that the Government were not willing even to consider the matter. Surely that is not too much to ask? Although the problem will exist for only a short time, nurses are severely underpaid. If the Government care about nurses' conditions, they should show a little more interest in, and willingness to consider, the matter. That is all that we ask.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Lady will be disappointed, as we cannot make such a commitment. The principle is clear. I see no point in making the sort of commitments and promises that the hon. Lady suggests, as the principle is known and should not be violated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We looked carefully at the position of mixed households of students and others, which has been raised by a number of hon. Members. If a student moves into a flat with a non-student, the bill will not increase. The non-student will continue to be able to claim benefit. Therefore, there is no justification for exempting such mixed households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, my former House of Commons secretary, who is now a full-time student at Kingston polytechnic, will be exempt from paying the council tax. However, she has a lodger who is in full-time employment and that lodger will have to pay 75 per cent. The arrangements that my former secretary, as flat owner, will make with her lodger are clear. It would be perverse and absurd if all those who had a student in their household could claim exemption for themselves. That might do wonders for student accommodation, but it would not make sense to say that, if a household is mixed, the whole household should be exempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is about the fourth time that reference has been made to mixed households. However, we should like the Minister to address the position of two students who co-own a dwelling if one of them ceases to be a student for any
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
reason—perhaps ill health. That dwelling will be no longer exempt from the council tax but, because a student still lives there, there will be a 25 per cent. discount. Therefore, the student and the non-student will have to pay 75 per cent. of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they are on benefit, they will be able to claim extra benefit. It is no different from a household in which a student lives with his mother or father, as the parent will be liable to 75 per cent. of the council tax. We cannot create a system in which, if one occupant ceases to be a student, the whole dwelling continues to be exempt even if the other occupant is employed. That would not make sense, because two classes of occupant would be created; one who lives with a student, who would pay 75 per cent., and another in a two-student household, who would be exempt even if one of them ceased to be a student. That would not be fair in natural justice to all those single occupiers who share a property with a student.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for this discussion. I said that, if a person ceases to be a student—perhaps due to ill health—the other occupant, who continues to be a student, will have to pay towards the new tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the Under-Secretary to say no. How will that person get away with not paying the tax? This Bill is wrongly targeted; it does not help those who need the most help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the ex-student is in ill health, is not working and is in receipt of benefit, the household is in exactly the same position as any two-person household in which one person only is a student. One cannot devise legislation under which ex-students continue to have the status of students. That would be an administrative nightmare and it would be wrong in principle and in law to create such legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Under-Secretary would agree that what has just been described is a formula that discredits the whole of the status discount system. Does he agree that status discount will be an anomaly and that its operation will be deficient, because its basic principle is wrong? Does he also agree that the amendment, which has been moved with considerable eloquence and at some length by my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), would remove a further anomaly whereby one set of student nurses will be entitled to something to which other student nurses, albeit temporarily, will not be entitled? We believe that the amendment would remove an anomaly by ensuring that one group of student nurses are treated no differently from those with whom they work on the wards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already been through the principle of the hon. Gentleman's last point in great detail.

The Opposition appear to be saying either that there should be no exemption for students or that once one is a student one is always a student. That is an absurd position.

	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
We must have legislation that makes it clear that if someone ceases to be in a category in which he or she is entitled to exemptions and has moved on, that person cannot claim to be in a class of ex-students who should be treated for all time as being in the same position as students. I believe that everyone in this Room would come into the category of ex-students.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, if a student graduates and walks straight into a job that pays £20,000 a year, it is perfectly reasonable for society to expect that person to pay his or her share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is an ex-student.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the student leaves, graduates or fails to graduate and is not earning, he or she will be eligible for rebate, which could mean a zero contribution or anything possible in between on the level of that rebate. I cannot understand why the Opposition are making a fuss about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) for making that point. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said, "He is an ex-student." Ex-students are what the Opposition have been talking about and they are seeking, to create a separate category of ex-students, including those who failed to graduate through ill-health, failing their exams and so on. Those who are ex-students cease to be in the student category that gets exemptions. If one is on a low income for any reason and qualifies for income support, one applies for a rebate under the social security benefit system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But student nurses are not ex-students. They are in no different a position from someone who is seconded and paid by the armed services to be a full-time university student. Such people are paid the wage they would have received had they remained on active service. That applies to a trainee social worker, someone who is seconded to take an MA or a person in the civil service seconded to study for a law degree. That is what happens at present and all of those people would be entitled to the same status as other students. Why are student nurses to be treated differently from them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Student nurses are employees who are eligible for benefit under the social security system. That is the important distinction from student nurses on Project 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are going round in circles for no apparent point. It is clear that there is a major difference of principle and view about the matter which I fear will have to be resolved by a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with amendments Nos. 30 and 53 because the Committee is anxious to get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will a vote resolve the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will resolve it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 30 defines student nurses and proposes that any dwelling occupied wholly by student nurses who are on Project 2000 and, indeed, if they are not, should be exempt. I have explained why we consider that mixed households should not be exempt and the same principle applies to dwellings occupied solely by student
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
nurses on the traditional courses. Student nurses on those courses have access to benefits and may get rebates up to 100 per cent. of their bills, depending on their income. Therefore, there is no need to exempt all student nurse dwellings and I urge the Opposition to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 defines a student for the purpose of exempting dwellings. I said that we shall be making an order to exempt dwellings occupied solely by students. We shall consider the definition of students at that time, but I assure the Committee that it will be in line with the definition used for the community charge. The amendment is unnecessary and I urge the Committee to reject it. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) will allow me to finish what I have to say—I have been generous in giving way—we shall get on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that there will be a difference of opinion on the principle of student nurses. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for some of his remarks on the wider categories with which we were concerned and look forward with interest to what he brings forth in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more contentious part of his comments illustrates the difficulties faced by the Committee. We have to make do with statements and pronouncements by Ministers outside the House, rather than with proposals in Bills and other proposed legislation. That is one of the factors that have made the debate so difficult. The Minister and his colleagues have created an extraordinarily complex structure of exemptions, discounts and rebates. Given that the exemption depends on status, that that status can change, and that such a change in status can influence the liability of others whose status has not changed, we are worried about the rationality, equity and practicality of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shakes his head. However, I return to the example used by my hon. Friend the Minister for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) of two full-time students who happily believe that their property is exempt from council tax. One, because of an accident or for other reasons, may cease to be a student. No one objects to the fact that the liability of that person, whose status has changed, should also change in accordance with the rules—peculiar though they are. What is odd is that the liability of the remaining person should change, even though his or her status has not changed. As such changes must be tracked day by day, the whole thing is, frankly, unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has attempted to distinguish on the basis of a technicality—as his ministerial colleagues have done on other occasions—between two categories of student nurse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain. I shall be astonished if, at the end of my comments, Conservative Members do not agree that the distinction is technical, as it is defined in terms of access to the benefits system. That is the essential differentiating characteristic between the two categories of student nurse. Their reliance on that point illustrates the Government's confusion about the structure of exemptions, discounts and rebates and the relevance of resources to each of those categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Patently, resources are directly relevant to rebates—I trust that the Government are in no doubt about that. We have it with equal assurance from the Under-Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), that resources have absolutely nothing whatever to do with discounts. However, when it comes to exemptions, we are in an uneasy no man's land. The Bill says nothing about resources or ability to pay, yet much of the rationale underlying the concept of exemptions is that people who simply cannot afford to pay should be relieved of that obligation. Resources are clearly relevant to rebates; resources have absolutely nothing to do with discounts; but in the case of exemptions we do not really know. However, in the case of student nurses, up pops the question of access to the benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) read from the briefing supplied by the Royal College of Nursing the comparative income figures from both categories. They are virtually identical—one could hardly slide a cigarette paper between them. Of all the factors that might be relevant to different categories of student nurse and that might dictate their respective ability to pay their bills, the weekly income is surely the most important. However, the Government have chosen a factor that might or might not at some point apply to one or other category. That is a contingent factor—it is by no means a defining factor—of their actual ability to pay the bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If resources are the criterion, as is implied by the Minister's point about access to the benefits system, we should examine the evidence. The evidence about resources is that no distinction can be drawn between the two categories of nurse. That is why I said that the Government are taking refuge in a technical distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few minutes ago, my hon. Friend asked about some figures, but the Minister was unable to supply them; that was probably because no student nurses qualify in the benefits system. If the nurse is over 24 or 25 years of age, he or she qualifies for access to income support when wages are around £40, or, if the nurse is under that age, as most male or female student nurses are, at around £30, although an increase in that level is due soon. Except for rare cases of student nurses in special circumstances, for example one with three or four children, none of the 55,000 student nurses has access to the benefits system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's interesting point reinforces my central argument that the Government have chosen an almost irrelevant criterion with which to justify treating differently two virtually inseparable groups of student nurses. Having sheltered behind that technicality in order to reach the outcome that has generated so much hostility and resentment, the peculiarity is that the Minister has conceded what was apparent to everyone: that he is making that dictinction to cope with a transitional situation. Why will the Minister not say that in this case—whatever stand he may care to take on his peculiar technicalities—the two groups of nurses are one and the same? The obvious way to handle the problem is to say that the distinction will be wiped out soon anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is telling the Committee that the distinction is technical, but it is not. It marks a major difference in the way that nurses are employed, and the way that they receive an income. One is a paid employee of the national health service, who works a shift system on wards, the other is a student nurse
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
on Project 2000, on a classroom-based course, which is analagous to that of a university student. The hon. Gentleman said, "Oh well, over a period of time the distinction will disappear." Of course it will: the old system of training student nurses, by which they were employees of the NHS and worked on wards, is disappearing. Until that system disappears, there is a clear distinction—in principle and in operation—that is not technical. Student nurses under the old training system should be treated as employees; other people in a similar situation are treated that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the Minister's protestations, it is perfectly clear that he is describing a technical distinction. The only way that he could define the difference was by referring to access to benefits, which is scarcely relevant and is certainly far from being the central issue that defines the respective resources of the nurses. I fear that we shall not be able to persuade the Minister on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a final effort to persuade the Minister on this matter, even at this late stage. The Secretary of State for Health has said that the so-called employee students are in a transitional phasing-out period. Could not a transitional payment be made during that period which would be equivalent to the exemption rate that will apply to nurses on Project 2000? That would allow the Minister to stand by his principles, and both sets of students to be treated in exactly the same way. Exemption could be phased out at the same time as the conditions that apply to so-called employee students.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister has heard my hon. Friend's remarks. I shall give the Minister a chance to respond to that point, if he feels so inclined. However, he shows little inclination to do so. I suspect that we shall be obliged to report to the nursing world, and the wider public, that the Government are determined to maintain their divisive and technical distinction. However, the Minister now wants to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question for the hon. Gentleman. There are thousands of other people in similar circumstances to student nurses who are in paid employment or in training. Does the hon. Gentleman propose that technical distinction that he makes, which applies to student nurses who are training on the wards under the old system, should be extended to all those other people? There is nothing in the amendment to that effect. It would create a serious anomaly between one form of paid employment in training and another such form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that if the Minister had been following the argument he would know the answer to his question straightaway. We did not have to specify in the amendment the factor that distinguishes student nurses from other people in similar circumstances because that factor is implicit in their status; their status is changing; it is transitional. During the next year or two, they will become indistinguishable from those engaged on Project 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not seem to grasp the point. The system is changing from one of paid employment training on-the-job in the hospitals to one in the classroom under Project 2000, but for no individual in training will his or her training change. All those who are paid employees, who receive a salary and are training on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
the ward as student nurses, will finish their training under that system. Therefore, there is no transitional arrangement for any individual which might cause the hon. Gentleman to say that there is injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand that point. The transition is that those who are currently in one category will drop out of the picture. Within a year or two, everyone who is described as a student nurse will be in the same category. Those people work side-by-side doing much the same job but for the technical reasons described by the Minister—again as though they are a full explanation—they are treated differently. That is a ridiculous distinction. It has no bearing on their ability to meet the obligations. The problem is scheduled to disappear within a short time. That limits the problem and makes it manageable and so the Government should be able to do something about it. If they will not and cannot, we can draw only one conclusion: they are simply not anxious to help student nurses. Everyone understands that those who are described as student nurses fall into both categories. There is no real distinction between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is simply after cheap vote grabbing. He is not prepared to consider principles. It would be a dangerous day when the British Parliament created a law which treated one group of paid employees in training differently from another. The hon. Gentleman's approach would create ridiculous circumstances in which student nurses who are paid employees in training under the old system would be exempt and yet other people in paid employment on training who work beside them—such as laboratory technicians in a hospital—would not be exempt. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. There is a clear distinction between those who are students in receipt of a grant and who cannot claim social security benefits and those who are paid employees in training who can claim benefit. That is the important principle and must be the clear dividing line. The hon. Gentleman's approach would mean treating different classes of people in the same circumstances in completely different ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that we are prolonging this debate unnecessarily because the Minister simply cannot understand the nature of his argument. Will he accept the following propositions? We are dealing with a group of people who are commonly described as student nurses, whether or not they pursue the course labelled project 2000. The Minister distinguishes between them on the basis that some are technically to be described as employees of the national health service whereas others derive their income from something that is technically called a bursary and so are to be regarded as students. When the Minister is asked to specify that distinction, to say how it is to be identified, he says that it is because one group has access to benefits—under the rules established by the Government—and the other group does not. That is scarcely a relevant distinction, and in any case it will disappear within a couple of years, but as long as it is acted upon in the way described by the Minister, it will create enormous bitterness and resentment among those within that group who regard themselves as student nurses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister never responded to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), so let me put to him the case of
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
a young couple. The man, or perhaps the woman, is a graduate who has been seconded by his company to go back as a full-time student to do another degree at university. Let us say that he earns £15,000 a year. In this category, he is not regarded as an exempted person. The other partner is a student nurse employed by the national health service. Consequently, instead of the couple being regarded as exempt, they will have to pay. Yet if the student nurse were a Project 2000 nurse, hers would be regarded as an exempt household. We are creating a mad-cap scene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only agree with my hon. Friend. I fear, for reasons that I stated earlier, that if we allow the debate to continue, the Minister will simply stand up and repeat the technical distinction that he has made. I am sure that he is about to do just that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman by pointing to another so-called technical distinction between paid employees and students. Paid employees who are student nurses pay income tax and national insurance contributions: they are paid employees. Students who are on Project 2000 with a bursary are not. There is a clear difference. It is dangerous to divide off student nurses who are paid employees from other paid employees in training such as laboratory technicians. Governments must stick to principles; and I regret that the Opposition are incapable of ever sticking to a point of philosophical principle irrespective of practicalities. That is cheap vote grubbing, and their claim that there are two sorts of student nurse is a mere technicality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the issue of principle and consistency. I was struck when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) described the Minister's position as absurd. I could not but remark that that was precisely the word that that Minister used when he spoke about the introduction of a property-based tax in this country. That should induce a little humility in the Minister when it comes to issues of principle.

	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 3, line 16, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) the fact that dwellings are occupied or owned by persons who have an income or assets falling below a value or values prescribed for this purpose by the Secretary of State.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 33, in page 3, line 16, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'and of which the resident has an income or assets falling below a value or values prescribed for this purpose by the Secretary of State.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of the amendments can be briefly stated. I have no intention of delaying the Committee, as all the issues have already been ventilated. As I said earlier, it is clear that exemptions under the clause depend either on the status of the occupants or residents of a property, or on the nature of the property. In many cases, the rationale of the exemption is that certain categories of people are unable to pay. Either they are unable to pay, or they do not have the means to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we know, that is in marked contrast to the principles underlying the discount system, which we shall debate in clause 11. I broadly welcome the fact that the basis of exemption is related in some sense to the ability to pay. The amendment invites the Government to make that link clearer in the Bill. Instead of two paragraphs defining exempted properties, the amendment would add a third paragraph which would make it clear that the income of occupants is relevant. Were the Government to accept the amendment, it would go a long way to allaying fears and to clarifying the respects in which the Secretary of State would exercise his discretion in due course. It cannot do any harm, and it might do some good. I hope that the Minister will accept this modest amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to provide exemption for dwellings occupied by people whose income and assets are below a prescribed level. They are unnecessary, since clause 4(4) already allows my right hon. Friend to prescribe classes of exempt dwellings by reference to such factors as he sees fit. Clause 4(4)(b) goes further and provides, without prejudice to the general power, that those factors may include the fact that dwellings are occupied or owned by persons of a prescribed description.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend were minded to exempt dwellings occupied or owned by people with a low level of income or assets, he could do so using powers already in the Bill. In fact, my right hon. Friend sees no necessity to provide exemption from the council tax in such cases. People on low incomes will be given help through council tax benefit, which will be tailored specifically to their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exemption is equivalent to a 100 per cent. benefit, which will be available under our proposals to many people with incomes at or below the income support level. We shall also provide benefit to many people with incomes above this level, through benefit on a sliding scale. The hon. Gentleman's proposal does not have that flexibility. A dwelling is either exempt or not, so rebates would be necessary as well as exemption, to provide help for those with incomes just above the level that qualified for
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
exemption. That would result in much greater complexity and administrative cost. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Dagenham to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the Minister to comment on a central point. In line with some of the assurances that he has given the Committee, exemption—the exercise of the discretion to identify properties and categories of persons—is the means of helping certain people to meet their obligations. Surely what matters is not simply the fact that people are hospital patients, but that as hospital patients they do not have any income. That is why the exemption provision should be brought into effect. Will the Minister confirm that the means-related principle is in play and that that is what is being applied in most of the cases for which discretion will be exercised under the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State would have this power if he needed it but he does not consider it necessary to provide exemption from council tax in such cases; it is considered much better to do that through the benefit system, which can allow for up to 100 per cent. exemption for people on or below income support levels. For those above those levels, the system allows for a sliding scale. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion, which attempts to effect what we propose, would be more complex and expensive. No doubt the hon. Gentleman agrees that we want to avoid creating a more costly system while arriving at the same end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A further small point. It is common ground that we are talking in most cases about unoccupied property when the person who would usually occupy it is unable to do so—circumstances in which it would be unfair to require him to pay council tax. We concede that that must be so if a person is in prison or hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and I discussed briefly this morning, what happens in cases such as that of a constituent which was brought to me recently? This person is blind, and did live in my constituency. He has difficulty finding work. He was promised a job in Cambridgeshire so he used his savings to buy a house there. But no sooner had he done that than two things happened: the dog that he had been promised did not come to him and his elderly father fell ill, and he had to return to my constituency to care for his father. He now has a house that he cannot occupy, for which he has no use; he cannot sell it but he is required to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that my constituent might fall into one of the categories that would be helped because he is a carer, but that is simply an additional reason why he might get some help. What if he had not returned to become a carer but was nevertheless without income in the situation that I described? Surely it would be sensible, on grounds of income alone, to declare such an unoccupied dwelling an exempted one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is leading us down the difficult road of specific cases. The person whose case he described would be exempt by virtue of being a carer. Our example of people on low incomes who get exemption through the benefit system—100 per cent. exemption if they are on income support or lower, but with the sliding scale or taper for people above that level which the hon. Gentleman's amendment would not allow—is much more sensible. I urge him to withdraw his amendment. We seek

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 3, line 16, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5) No order shall be made by the Secretary of State unless a draft of the order has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 54, in page 3, line 16, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5) No order shall be made by the Secretary of State under subsection (2) above unless a draft of the order has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament, following consultation with persons representative of persons affected by such an order, including persons representative of students.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are the final amendments to clause 4, and they are more significant now than when they were tabled. In each case, we ask for an affirmative resolution of the House on issues relating to exempt dwellings, which were discussed on previous amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'exempt dwelling' means any dwelling of a class prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
We are concerned that that gives power to the Secretary of State without the need to refer to Parliament. We should consider the arguments for exempting people such as students, those in need and those in poverty. Members of Parliament should be able to present the case to Parliament for consideration by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other organisations, such as Mencap and the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, are asking for clarification on a number of matters. If the Secretary of State has the power to authorise the exemption of properties, power will be taken away from Members of Parliament. Local authority associations, such as the Association of District Councils, are also asking for clarification of certain matters, including clause 4(2). That can only be done if Parliament is able to consider such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the Labour party's proposed fair rates scheme. The difference between that scheme and this legislation is that our proposals are clear and explicit. This legislation does not clarify important matters and it will be left to the Secretary of State to make regulations, which gives him tremendous power.

Yesterday, the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) said:

	<br><blockquote><p>—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 19 November 1991; c. 60.]</p></blockquote>
The fine print is in the Labour party's document for people to read. We believe that the Bill, too, should include the fine print.

The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said yesterday:
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>

My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) produced the figures.

The difference between our proposals and this legislation is stark. We provide the information; this legislation gives power to the Secretary of State to provide information that Parliament will not have the opportunity to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the fair rates bill for a £200,000 house in the London borough of Enfield? What would be the fair rates bill for a £50,000 house in Stockport? The hon. Gentleman cannot tell me because the Labour party has only published averages. We have frequently made the point that the averages given by the Labour party are meaningless. It has published averages because it is afraid to tell people how much their bills would be. By contrast, the Government, in the council tax exemplifications, have been willing to tell people in every type of house in every constituency what their bills would have been this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that his averages are fraudulent because their total does not add up to the amount of local authority finance that needs to be raised. By this old canard the Labour party has obscured the subject as much as it possibly can.

Having first asserted on Second Reading that we have not published figures for individual local authority districts, the Minister has obviously now examined them and has discovered—they presto—that they are average figures. Of course, they are average figures. By publishing those average figures based on an average rateable value for any given local authority district, we have made it possible for an individual householder, who will know what his or her rateable value will be in relation to that average, to work out to the last penny what his or her fair rates bill will be. The Minister of State's attack on my hon. Friend is nonsensical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discussed the poll tax, we were given average figures. Each set of average figures provided by the Government were misleading and wrong, and well outside the scope of what had to be paid.

Friend the Member for Dagenham who said that people could work out to the last penny what their fair rates bills would be? Will the hon. Gentleman explain how people could do that when they would not know what weighting will be given to capital values, rental values, insurance values and repair values—all the values that are mentioned as being the way in which houses will be revalued? I shall continue along these lines for a bit, so that his hon. Friend can prompt him into replying to me.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going wide of the debate. Perhaps hon. Members will quickly draw the exchange to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should re-examine the publication on fair rates issused 18 months ago by the Labour party. If we are given the opportunity to debate the issue to which he is referring, all his points can be explained. I am worried about the difference between the Bill and how it has been presented, and the Labour party's publication on the financing of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Sir Michael, that it is regrettable that, during my hon. Friend's speech, we should attempt to debate a subject that was initiated by the Minister. The hon. Gentleman has again asked a nonsensical question, as our fair rates proposals and the figures that we published were for this year, calculated on the basis of the existing valuation register. The Minister's attempt to refer us to other criteria is entirely beside the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three opportunities are available. Last night we discussed at length a local income tax linked to the ability to pay. It is perfectly fair to examine the point now being raised. One can find out exactly what someone would pay under the fair rates system proposed by the Labour party. I have an extract from the fair rates proposal, and I wonder how the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) can justify his comment if he cannot say what the rebate would be. He knows that any form of property tax is unfair unless there is some form of rebate or discount for those who cannot afford to pay. One extended rebates, "Fair Rates" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The timing of these changes will depend on the situation we inherit and, in particular, the existing resources available from previous changes made to the poll tax rebate and relief schemes."</p></blockquote>
There is no guarantee from the Labour party that people who need discounts or rebates would get them in the first year of introduction. We would be back to a property tax that was unfair. I do not know how that can be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can now get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the two amendments before the Committee. We are concerned that the Bill, like previous legislation dealing with local government finance, is being shadowed in regulations and powers given to the Secretary of State. Given the earlier discussion on the clause, there should be more information in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
Page after page of the research document presented by the Government refers to the regulations prescribing classes of property. For example, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations may be made to determine in which part of a billing authority's area a dwelling is."</p></blockquote>
A full list of the proposed regulations follows and there are more throughout the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried by the hisotry of the Government's approach to local government finance. A 1986 Green Paper proposed a 10-year phasing-in period. In July 1987, the Government instituted a four-year phasing-in period to introduce local goverment finance. This is the second major Bill on local government finance in two years. It is time that the Government included more detail and more information, so that Members of Parliament can discuss matters before Bills go on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background against which I move the amendments. We are worried because we know what has happened in the past. We consider that the finest light to guide us into the future is what has happened in the past. The amendments are constructive and would make the Bill more open. Information would be available for Members of Parliament to discuss, and outside bodies would be wiser and more involved in what was happening in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the hon.

Amendment No. 31 calls for an affirmative resolution. I shall explain to members of the Committee who may not be as au fait with affirmative and negative resolutions as the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that an affirmative resolution is used mainly for major financial or constitutional matters. Classes of property as detailed in clause 4 would not normally be dealt with by affirmative resolution, but would be dealt with through the negative resolution procedure. If we did as the hon. Gentleman suggested, the House would spend all its time dealing with affirmative resolutions on relatively minor matters. The negative resolution procedure, which will be used for the exemption of properties, is right for clause 4. On banding, we shall be using affirmative resolutions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—as I am sure the hon. Gentleman was about to point out. There must be a distinction between the routes followed for the different parts of the Bill, depending on their importance. The negative resolution procedure is not appropriate for clause 4. In clause 5, it is our intention to use the affirmative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 54 echoes amendment No. 31, but goes one stage further, requiring my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to consult representatives of those who would be in the exempt dwellings category, including students. I give the Committee the assurance that we shall discuss why the proposals to exempt dwellings—and therefore the amendment—are unnecessary. I ask the hon. Member for Normanton to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that we wanted to place on record our concern about what would happen under clause 4.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave an assurance that students and others would be consulted before such orders were tabled, but will that assurance be included in those orders? I always point out during proceedings on United Kingdom Bills that there is a clear difference between Scottish and English law. As I understand English law, if a Minister gives an assurance of that nature in a Committee, it may be brought in as evidence during any court proceedings that might arise as a result of the legislation. In Scotland, that is not the case, so it must be built into legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify one or two points relating to exemptions. The Minister may think that they are technical and minor, but they are of considerable importance to some of my constituents. I am sorry that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is not present because my remarks are intended more for him than for the other Ministers. No doubt he will hear about them in a mysterious way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister alluded to property requiring or undergoing structural repair. Under the poll tax legislation, a dwelling that could not be lived in because it was being repaired, improved or reconstructed was exempt. That is again the case under the proposals for the new council tax, but there is a problem. If a property requires repairs which may have been started but which have ceased because of lack of money, no planning permission and so on, payment is required under the poll tax legislation if the repairs are not continuous. I ask whichever Minister is responsible to study that matter so that we do not encounter the same problem with the council tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax legislation covered a dwelling house situated on land for agricultural purposes or in woodlands, market gardens, orchards and so on, which is unoccupied and unfurnished. There is more to the matter, but such a dwelling was exempt. That same exemption does not appear to be mentioned in the proposals for the council tax. I hope that it will be incorporated in the list of exemptions. If I am fortunate enough to be called to speak at a later date, I hope to say more about agricultural properties. That particular exemption was included in the poll tax legislation, but I cannot see it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification on another point. Under the poll tax legislation, a community charge registration officer was required to delete an entry from the date of a deceased person's death. I hope that the Bill will change that in relation to exemptions. I know that in regulations relating to the Bill, property that forms part of the estate of a deceased person will be exempt until six months after the grant of probate and so on. I want to ensure that someone will not be charged council tax for the day that person died. I hope that the Minister will agree that that person should be charged only until midnight on the day before that death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to provide details, but the relatives of one of my constituents who was lost from a fishing boat were very upset when asked to pay poll tax for the day that he died. On behalf of my constituents—indeed, on behalf of all the people in the United Kingdom—I want to ensure that council tax should not be paid for the day of death. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland especially will take account of my plea.

	<div class='title'>DIFFERENT AMOUNTS FOR DWELLINGS IN DIFFERENT VALUATION BANDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 3, line 17, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) The amounts of council tax payable in respect of dwellings situated in the area of any billing authority (or the same part of such an area) shall be in proportion to the rateable value of the property in that area held on the valuation list.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>amendment No. 92, in clause 74, page 48, line 36, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'The amounts of regional, island and district council tax payable in respect of each dwelling situated in the area of any billing authority shall be in proportion to the rateable value of the property on the valuation roll'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>New Clause 1—	<i>Valuation Roll</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>'All properties shall be entered in the valuation roll in respect of financial year 1993–94 or any subsequent financial year except such properties that the Secretary of State shall exempt by order. An order showing which category of property shall be exempt shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would remove the banding element from the valuation process. It is perhaps a more than incidental consequence that it would also remove the ratio provision that flattens or dampens liability at the top end of the scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not today debating the respective merits of particular banding systems, but focusing on the principle of banding. Yesterday the Minister defended the principle of banding with considerable enthusiasm. He did not say that it was a regrettable necessity, but that it had merits and advantages, and he developed his case by sweeping to one side in a cavalier fashion some of the more obvious practical difficulties that attend it. He said, for example, that most people would not much mind which band they were in because the difference in their liability would be very small. He more or less implied that they would hardly notice and would not get steamed up about it—they would not mind the financial consequences of being placed in the wrong band, and would not be worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened in wonderment to the Minister's arguments. He revealed a complete ignorance of the psychological make-up of most people and of the financial facts of life. The differences matter; they are of great consequence to the pockets and the well-being of many people, as he will discover to his cost. That would be true if we were still dealing with rateable values, which are relatively small and stable sums. But the problem will be exacerbated by the fact that we are dealing with capital values—very large amounts, which people watch closely. Not surprisingly, people have an abiding interest in the value of their property on the open market, and will know if the valuers get it wrong. Furthermore, they will be able to make comparisons with similar properties in similar streets or neighbourhoods. If they believe that they have been wrongly placed, they will feel strongly about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not understand that, I suspect that we are confronted with someone who might be intellectually and academically competent to mastermind the passage of the Bill through the House but is totally unfitted to legislate for the people of this country. That allows us an insight into why the poll tax went so badly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
If the Minister thinks that such matters are of no consequence to most ordinary people, why does he think that law-abiding citizens from Windsor and Maidenhead—most of whom are Conservative voters—took to the streets in noisy, almost violent demonstrations about the level of their poll tax? It was not because poll tax bills were ipso facto hugely expensive. Indeed, considering the sums involved, it might well have been a matter of great surprise, almost incredulity, that people felt so strongly. However, they did feel strongly. What took them on to the streets was a sense of injustice and the fact that, for many people, what the Minister might consider a small sum mattered greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Minister think that Conservative councillors from Witney in west Oxfordshire felt so strongly about the poll tax that they resigned the Tory whip virtually en masse? It was because such things matter. It is surprising that the Minister does not seem to understand that and seems so detached from reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister defended the principle of banding, but he failed to explain credibly why that departure from normally accepted practice was adopted. We all know that the tradition and practice for years has been to talk about the valuation of individual properties. If a system of tax liability that reflects property values is imposed, it is incumbent on us to do a proper job, not the slipshod, crude job of simply whacking huge numbers of houses into poorly drafted bands. If tax liability depends on such matters, the job should be done properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not offer any real explanation as to why he and his colleagues adopted banding because he did not want to reveal the true motive—the Government are desperate to enact the measure as quickly as possible for their own political and electoral reasons. They want to maintain the illusion that the administration of the Bill can be brought to fruition by their deadline of 1 April 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government knew that it would take a lot of time to pursue the ordinary principles of evaluating using a new valuation basis not yet tried in or applied to England and Wales. They could not afford that time. If they were to follow the obvious and honourable course, they would have to concede to the British people that they would face a general election with the poll tax still on the statute book, with little prospect of its removal in the foreseeable future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been lumbered with the totally unsatisfactory banding proposal because of the Government's discreditable motives in acting with haste and speed in trying to save their electoral skin. The same motives that produced banding have also produced the willingness to employ all sorts of people from the private sector to do cut-price valuations in job lots of 10,000 or 20,000 houses. Some of the bids for that work are as low as 80p a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, I received a heartfelt letter from a firm of estate agents and chartered surveyors in Bath. It is amusing that so much poll tax and council tax unhappiness seems to be generated in the Tory party chairman's constituency—the letter is yet another example. There is no indication that the firm supports the Labour party; as far as I know, it has no connection with my, or any other, party. The author expresses the gravest anxiety about how his and other firms will be able to handle the burden that will be required of them. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On average, firms were asked to consider batches of valuations averaging 10,000 properties per batch. It is proposed that these valuations are carried out by external inspection only, from the road".</p></blockquote>

Interestingly, no mention is made of the sky. The author continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are 5 months to complete this task. In today's economic climate, there must be very few firms indeed who have the staffing to suddenly carry out 10,000 external valuations if they were to submit a tender for one batch only."</p></blockquote>
Firms are not allowed to subcontract or assign their tasks. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is unlikely that any new recruit will have sufficient experience of valuations"</p></blockquote>
to do a proper job. The author says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has been suggested that both qualified and unqualified personnel can carry put the valuations. In my experience, unqualified personnel … have little idea of values … The majority of local independent firms with qualified valuers have for inexplicable reasons not been accepted for qualification."</p></blockquote>
Consequently, large corporate bodies with very little knowledge of local values will do most of the work. There are no tender guidelines. Some firms that are desperate for cash will put in rock-bottom bids for cash-flow purposes and will probably be unable to complete the exercise properly. The writer concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In summary the whole exercise is a charade, the panic stricken government clearly stumbling from one half hearted solution to another!"</p></blockquote>
The author is an independent expert and practitioner who was speaking from the heart and from experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dismiss all those criticism. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede one point about valuations. In my and neighbouring constituencies, areas such as The Meadows, Lenton, Radford and Sneinton have many streets that are full of almost identical terraced housing. I assure the hon. Gentleman that no one in his right mind would suggest that such housing should fall into anything other than band A. Evidence for that, through estate agents, is available to everyone with eyes to see it. Frankly, 80p a house is too much; using estate agents is so easy a solution that it is unbelievable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The haste and speed underlying the banding proposal has produced a helter-skelter rush to an inadequate and inefficient banding and valuation process. The banding proposal is not simply objectionable in principle, or from the valuer's viewpoint; it also raises the difficulty—which may still be relevant, despite the assurances of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) about the uniformity of housing in parts of his constituency—that many people will say, "Well, my house may look the same as our neighbour's, but it is very different." The Minister dismissed that problem by saying that we should be able to solve it with aerial surveillance. That answer is not good enough—perhaps he has been watching too many Beatles films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a means by which individual variations can be taken into account. That may be significant where a valuation is near the borders of a band. What would the hon. Member for Nottingham, South say, for example, if many houses in his constituency were valued at about £40,000, on the border of a band? We might then hear a different story. This is an important matter for many people, who will want an assurance that they are not being lumped together with everyone else on the ground that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
fronts of their houses look similar. The hon. Gentleman has no answer to the problem of how variations can be properly taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further problems are involved. We have already mentioned the worries expressed by MENCAP and RADAR about how adaptations of specific houses should be accounted for and valued where undertaken for a disabled occupant. How will that problem be handled? There is also the issue of capital values, which do not necessarily reflect the real value of a property to an occupant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter from the Tenant Farmers Association. As far as I know, the association has no political affiliations. The letter says that members have been trying to establish clear answers to questions that they raised—so far, without any success. The issue was also raised by the hon. Member for Lancaster (Dame E. Kellet-Bowman) on Second Reading. She was told:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When she studies … the Bill she will find that many of her concerns have already been addressed … I am glad to be able to confirm that we have taken that point into account.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 November 1991; Vol 198, c. 785.]</p></blockquote>
Yet the writer from the Tenant Farmers Association says that he can see nothing in the Bill to resolve the problem. The association remains worried about self-employed people living in job-related accommodation. Tenant farmers have to reside in a farmhouse under the terms of their lease. They have to use the property for agricultural purposes. The farmhouse goes along with the farm; as a house sold on the open market it would doubtless do very well, but it is not of great value to tenant farmers—it is something that they have to take along with their self-employment. We should be delighted if the Minister would provide an answer to that problem, and so would the Tenant Farmers Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banding leads us to further problems. I have no doubt that ministerial optimism about appeals is entirely misplaced. There will be a huge number of appeals from people who believe that they have not had a proper valuation, that they have been placed in the wrong band or that they are in one band when their neighbours in comparable houses are in another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will note that tenants are given the right to appeal, but the right is not given until it is too late to affect the billing for April 1993. Moreover, the rate support grant settlement for 1992–3 will be determined by the valuation list produced in December 1992. Hence, the appeals procedure against banding is meaningless. It is simply a sop to disguise an undemocratic procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valuable and important point, leading to the point which I was about to make. She has illustrated a broader issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am accusing not the Minister of State but the Secretary of State, and I am reminded once again that he is not here to face the music. It is a typical example of what I shall call a "Heseltinian" priority for short-term electoral advantage over long-term practical problems. The Bill is an exercise intended to give the illusion that the poll tax can be abolished and a new poll tax put in place by 1 April 1993 so that voters in the forthcoming general election are lulled into a false sense of security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No attention is paid to the practical problems that the Government's short-sighted action is building up for us. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) is absolutely right to point out those problems.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
Moreover, many appeals will materialise in early 1993, just when local authorities are struggling with the operation of the new tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who then will carry out the individual valuations on each house in England and Wales in connection with appeals? Once a person has appealed, it can no longer be a matter of assuming that all the houses in a certain street are the same. Each valuation will have to be carried out individually. That will be difficult in Scotland, even with trained staff; I cannot see how it will be done in England and Wales and the costs will be enormous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is certainly right. It is another example of practical problems being pushed to the back of the queue. I doubt whether any real attention has been paid to the kind of issue raised by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other serious problems with banding are its unfairness and regressivity. By definition, as soon as bands are created, properties that creep in at the bottom of a band are overvalued and those at the top of a band—if individually valued—are undervalued. Broadly speaking, those who have the less valuable properties—there is often a correlation with their general financial circumstances—pay more than they should, whereas those at the top of a band pay less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a sharp discontinuity at the point at which bands change, as I mentioned earlier. Two houses can be valued at as little as £2,000 apart, reflecting something as minor as a five-minute shorter walk to the shops. Yet those houses might fall within two very different bands. As a result, households in similar circumstances will pay different amounts of council tax simply because of the banding system. The Minister assured us that people would not notice that and that, if they did, they would not care. I have already dealt with that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further consequence of banding. By compressing properties into a band and levying the same tax on houses within that band, in some parts of the country where most houses fall into one or just a few bands at either end of the scale this new tax will become virtually a flat-rate tax for many people. That is why we called it a property poll tax. That is a direct consequence of the banding system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is perhaps not the debate in which to discuss the regional problems thrown up by the banding system, Sir Michael. Those are perhaps matters for our debates a little later this afternoon. Nevertheless, those problems flow directly from the Government's attempts to short-circuit the valuation process in crude and hamfisted fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One consequence of banding that is relevant to the debate is the Government's use of the banding system to dampen liability at the top. That is clearly shown in the ratio of liability set out in clause 5(1). It is a deliberate attempt—as far as I know, Ministers have no shame about the matter; they are content to plead guilty—to relieve those at the top end of the scale from what would otherwise be their proportionate contribution, on the basis of value, to the new council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has occasionally read out with pride—he may be induced to do so again—the great savings that that dampening effect will produce for those at the top end of the scale. He does not seem to realise that every penny of those savings must be paid by someone else. Who? The rest of us; all those lower down the scale who, as a consequence, will have to pay higher average bills on their
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
properties. It is astonishing, but that fact still seems to elude the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) who asked a crassly ignorant question about that matter. He seems unable to distinguish between the concept of an arithmetical average and the concept of a bill for an average household. He has not grasped the fact that if the burden on those at the top end of the scale is relieved it must be redistributed, which means that those in an average position lower down the scale pay more. That is a simple, logical proposition, but I am not entirely surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not yet grasped it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's proposition may or may not be true, but he should have the guts to give the figures so that we can see whether it is true. All he has to do is put up or shut up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman demonstrates yet again that abuse is no substitute for the power to reason—
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My shoulders are broad and I am willing to bear such abuse. The hon. Gentleman has slipped smartly away from the point which he was making and no longer contends that with logic and arithmetical law we have perpetrated a trick on him. Perhaps a glimmer of understanding of our point is now dawning on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not understand it yet. That is unfortunate, but his hon. Friends may do so. Anyone who bothered to consider the problem would understand that if the burden is relieved at the top end of the scale, the money must come from somewhere, from those lower down the scale. That is why the bills for average households will be higher than they should be. Lower administrative costs, higher collection levels and the absence of any need for transitional arrangements under our scheme result in the figures which we published and which have been confirmed by independent experts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last night, the hon. Gentleman gave a clear answer on revaluation and I want to put a point of principle to him. There is a debate between the two major parties about valuations on banding and valuations on specific property. I shall refer to the council estate which I often use as a starting point. Let us imagine a pair of semi-detached houses, one of which has a new front door and has been improved by the owners with their own after-tax money. Is the Labour party saying that the owners of that slightly better property shall for ever more bear a higher local tax than their neighbours in the other half of the property? That is a matter of principle on specific valuation and we should be given a straight answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to offer an answer. It is available to the hon. Gentleman in our fair rates proposals. We make it clear that small improvements such as he described will not count for valuation purposes. It is clear also that if a tax is based on the value of property and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
the value of the property is increased by adding new rooms or by extending it substantially, the principle of applying the tax according to the value of the property should be followed through. We believe that regular revaluations should take place every five years, as was required under the rating legislation. To produce buoyant revenue in the meantime, there should be annual upratings so that the pain that might arise from five-year revaluations is mitigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not in dispute about what happens when an extra room or a garage is added. One cannot deny, however, that if a valuer looks at a pair of semi-detached houses and sees that one house is better maintained, he will put a higher value on it. Such differences are ignored under the banding system, but if the houses are valued independently, the difference cannot be dismissed as a small one: either the value is higher or it is not. That is the point which the hon. Gentleman ducks time and again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is whistling in the dark. We have made it clear that minor differences and changes—for example, the addition of central heating or double glazing or a change in the roof, doors or windows—will not be significant for valuation purposes. That is clearly set out in our proposals and I advise the hon. Gentleman to read them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the hon. Gentleman back to our proceedings this morning. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) referred to someone who spends quite a lot of money improving his home to a greater degree than merely putting in double glazing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He cited an extreme example of the value of a house being increased from £5,000 to £200,000. Let us consider someone who wishes to contribute towards the improvement of the housing stock of this country and who improves his house to such an extent that its value increases considerably. Under the hon. Gentleman's proposals, that person might be hammered—possibly within only a year or two, if it happened near the next revaluation. Under our proposals, that person would be protected because the new value would not apply until the new person who bought the house moved in, knowing exactly what he was buying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is astonishing and almost breathtaking that the hon. Gentleman, a supporter of a Government who imposed VAT on housing repairs and improvements, should dare to make such a stupid point. Either he supports a property tax based on the value of a property, or he does not. If he does not support such a tax, why does he not say so? I can accept that he does not support a property-based tax, but he should not try to duck out of the application of the very principle that is enshrined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last three or four interventions have not been about the amendment but have been about our fair rates proposals. The banding system is objectional in principle. It cannot be applied with any satisfactory consequences and it will cause enormous practical problems. It is a triumph of short-term expediency over any concern for the long-term problems that it will create. That is why I urge the Committee to accept our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On first looking at banding, I agree that certain arguments could be made for it. However, I remember vividly the problems when people did not improve their properties under the rating system and, as a result the properties fell into decay. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) may shake his head, but I could take him to properties in my constituency that fell into decay just because people could not afford to repair them. If a property is revalued at the time of sale, the opportunity for the new purchaser is clear. That seems to be the only logical way to arrive at a valuation. The problem of revaluation brought about today's position of our putting properties into bands and revaluing them when they are sold. That is far better than properties falling into decay because people cannot afford to improve them. In the past people could not do so for two reasons: the cost of the improvement and the increase in the rates because of that improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reminds me of the Bourbons. I am sure that most of my hon. Friends will know what I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 92 relates to clause 74 on Scotland and new clause 1 to valuations in Scotland. New clause 1 was originally drafted as an amendment to clause 74, but somehow it became a new clause and was linked to clause 5. I am beginning to get a strong feeling of Déjà vu about our proceedings. It takes me back nearly four years to 1987 and to the proceedings of the Committee on the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Bill, or ADRES as it came to be known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two themes that ran through the debates in that Committee are similar to those running through this Committee. Whenever we tabled an amendment to exempt someone who was poor, disabled or hard up, the Government said, "No. The principle is that everyone has to pay." Two Scottish Tory Members who are on this Committee voted against amendments that we tabled in that Committee to exempt severely mentally handicapped people from paying poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second theme that ran through that Committee—we shall see it again on these amendments—was the Government's defence of the rights of the rich against the rights of the poor. When it was suggested that those with incomes higher than the rest of us should pay a bit more, suddenly the principle went out the window.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should, in all fairness, concede that on Report I and my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) urged the Government to reconsider their position on severely mentally handicapped people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that the hon. Gentleman is right: they urged the Minister to reconsider. I will also give the then Minister, Michael Ancram, his due; he put through amendments in the House of Lords. However, on Report the hon. Gentleman was not prepared to join us and vote for the amendments. He wanted his Minister to reconsider—I accept that—but it took much arguing and pressure to produce even those minor amendments for the poorest and most hard up people in our society and for severely mentally disabled people. Having managed to get the concession, it took us two years of arguing at almost every Scottish Question Time and every Scottish debate to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
get the Government to accept that Alzheimer's disease was a form of severe mental handicap. So let us not hear from Conservative Members about how kind they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are prepared to hammer student nurses but want to ensure that those who live in Scotland, in houses worth more than £212,000 pay the same amount of council tax whatever their income. I slightly disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about the reasons for the clause and the banding system. I accept that one of the reasons is to make administration easier. It will cause an awful mess, but at least it will take the Government through to 1993, or certainly to the election. But there is another reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 and the sections on discounts are concessions that the Secretary of State for the Environment was forced to make by the hardline poll tax supporters, especially those in the Scottish Office. If the Secretary of State for Scotland and his two junior Ministers, the hon. Members for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) and for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who is here today, had had their way, there is no question but that the poll tax would have stayed despite the devastation that it had wrought on the people of Scotland and Scottish local government. Unwillingly, they accepted the proposals for a council tax but only at the price of a banding system that ensures that the wealthiest in our society still pay less than their fair share of local government taxation. The Government's banding system is not a system of valuation; it is designed to ensure that the better off pay a lower proportion of their income than those who are poorer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Secretary of State for the Environment wanted a straight return to the old rating system, even though he might have tried to hide that fact by changing the name or indulging in cosmetic changes around the edging. It is clear that if the hon. Member for Stirling can accept the principle of property taxation to keep his ministerial job and salary, he and his colleagues would not, in the end, have jibbed at going back to the rating system. The Secretary of State for the Environment should have shown a little more courage and stuck to his guns. Perhaps he still has ambitions and he believes that after the next election he will need their votes in a Tory party leadership election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling led a campaign in Scotland against our proposals for local government finance. It was one of the most misleading farragoes of smears, half-truths and downright falsehoods that Scotland has seen. He was the author of the crazy poll tax notion. A pamphlet published by the hon. Gentleman brought it all about. He has built his rather flimsy political career on his attacks upon property taxes, yet when the crunch came, he, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister calmly accepted the restoration of a property tax. To save their political blushes the Government have devised this rag-bag of a Bill, but it will end in the same administrative chaos as the poll tax. More importantly, it will mean that yet again the poor will pay more for local government services than they should in order to subsidise the rich. The amendment seeks to stop that, but it is a principle believed in by Conservative Members.

I am tired of hearing Ministers bleating that the better off in our society pay through their income tax for local government services. That would be fine if, at the same time as they cut the amount paid by the rich at local level,
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
the Government had, over the past 12 years, increased the income tax paid by the rich to balance it. But they have not. Far from it; the taxation system has ensured that the better off have also benefited. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I see the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) smiling richly; I imagine that he has benefited nicely himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The take from the higher tax band is far higher at a much lower level than it ever was under the crippling rates of the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think, Sir Michael, that you might say that we were straying too far by speaking of the principles of national taxation. The rich have benefited at the expense of the poor not only through income tax. Much of the burden has gone on to VAT. That is a flat-rate tax which many other people pay, but the poor pay a higher proportion of their income in VAT than do the rich. The central Government subsidy on council house rents has completely disappeared, yet mortgage tax relief has remained. There are many different ways in which the poor have subsidised the better off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that any national, buoyant tax will increase its yield over a number of years? It does not take a genius to understand that the top 1 per cent. of earners have benefited by £30,000 a year under the tax concessions gained from the present Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but I do not wish to stray further, as I see that you, Sir Michael, are beginning to get slightly restless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek a return to a fair rating system, based upon individual valuations. That would ensure that each person paid according to the value of his house, not in bands—particularly restricted bands as suggested by the Government—but based on a rate per pound of value set by the local authority. Of course, I say openly that the better off, living in larger and more expensive properties, will pay more than those who live in smaller, less expensive properties. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is muttering that they do so under his proposals. That is right, but the difference between those who are just outside the rebate system in the poorest valued houses and those in the richest is that the latter will pay only three times more than former, whereas their income and the value of their properties may be considerably more than three times higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will know of Newlands in my constituency because it neighbours his. Like his constituency, it is a smart, middle-class area, with houses valued up to £250,000 or £300,000 and distinguished residents such as the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow and others. There are people living there in houses worth £150,000 and with incomes well in excess of £50,000. They received a massive tax handout when they were asked to pay the same amount as someone living in a council house in Castlemilk, which is one of the largest and poorest council house schemes in Britain, with an income of about £7,000 a year whose house is valued at a minus rather than a plus factor. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) nods his head because he represents half of Castlemilk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that the new tax is marginally better as the person in Newlands will pay three times more than the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
person in Castlemilk. However, under the amendment they would pay tax that would bear a much closer relationship to the real differences in their incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government refuse to accept our amendment, we shall try to extend the number of bands to take account of those differences. The most logical and sensible way to arrive at a much better spread between those who are poor and those who are rich is to return to individual valuation. In Scotland, that is possible. It can be done quickly and easily and we have a valuation roll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have said over and over—it is becoming rather wearying—we intend to introduce a rebate system designed to take account of such circumstances. With few exceptions, the price of houses in rural areas is lower than those in the major suburban areas, and that will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strathclyde region stretches from the constituency of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) to that of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) and it contains a vast range of properties whose capital values vary enormously. I am sure that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute would agree that a five or six-bedroomed house in her constituency would have a considerably lower capital value than one of similar size in Newlands in my constituency. There will be the same taxing authority and the tax that people pay will be adjusted accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that an individual valuation system offers the best way forward. The Government should abandon their pretence that they can stick to some of the principles of the poll tax, which is what they are doing, and get rid of it completely. They should return to what they know, in their heart of hearts, is the sensible way forward, which is a tax system based on the individual valuation of properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with growing disbelief to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) because I am convinced that the system that we are discussing is not only efficient but will deliver a reasonable, fair result. It will be cheaper to administer and will be seen as fair by a large proportion of the population. That approach will certainly be seen as fairer than the suggestion that each and every property should be valued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart expressed concern for the poorest and the hard-up in our society. That has already been taken care of; they will receive up to 100 per cent. rebates. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the purpose of the structure being to assist the very rich at the expense of the not so rich. I do not want to misquote him, but that was the gist of his remarks. That is a fairly predictable refrain and it is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one considers the impact of banding and projected departmental figures, it is easy to see that the differences to which the hon. Gentleman refers and the gains which he claims for the better-off are as nothing compared with the impact of the Labour party's policies,
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
which at a stroke would sweep away capping, compulsory tendering and the Audit Commission. Those three changes alone would have a much greater impact on the bills of the average household than anything that we are discussing in the amendment. It is astonishing that the link has not been made by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to find a basis on which different households can be compared, to see whether their contributions are, broadly speaking, fair. I shall make a bet across the floor with the hon. Member for Cathcart, although I recognise that that is not encouraged, Sir Michael. I bet that in all future discussions on the tax, the issue in his constituency, as in mine, will not be whether we use formula A, B, C or even D. It will be whether, as a result of the Government's proposal or the hon. Gentleman's proposals—we look forward to seeing how those four separate valuations would work—a person in my constituency or in his will pay more, less or about the same. That is what we are talking about: does the tax sound fair, does it seem fair, and does it allow some correlation between the sum paid by a householder in an average-sized house and that paid by someone in a larger house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear the hon. Gentleman concede that we will win the next general election. The majority of my constituents—not all, as there are still some who want us to keep the poll tax—want to return to the rating system as they knew it. The last general election was fought in my constituency largely on the issue of the poll tax, as opposed to the rates. If a return to the rating system means changes to the valuation of properties, fair enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituents are concerned about what they are paying, and about what they are paying in relation to other people. The nature of the system that produces the answer is of secondary import. As the Committee knows, I have long supported the concept of a property tax. Labour Members are telling us yet again how wonderful the rating system is. If it really is so fair and wonderful, I ask them why the second thing that they would do, in the unlikely even of their coming to power and introducing the rating system, would be to abolish it? If it is so wonderful, why not hold on to it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Labour Members recognise that at very best—a very poor best—it is a stop gap. Any suggestion that it is anything else is for the birds. The system has been devalued by the Opposition Front Bench as effectively as Conservative spokesmen have, over the years, rejected it. Let us be in no doubt about that. We are considering a new system, which will be more efficient and allow people to move fairly smoothly, without major upheaval, from one payment band to another if they improve their home or move to another home within a local authority area. Yes, it will prevent massive bills—the nonsense bills that have driven individuals and businesses from old high-rate areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart gave himself away when he referred to council house tenants receiving no assistance from the Government. That claim is untrue. To save his embarrassment, I shall simply say that about £3 billion is being spent in that respect. Anyone can overlook a few pounds, but £3 billion is a rather large amount to overlook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for income tax, the Government's record can be easily checked. As a consequence of the reduction in the higher rates of income tax, the rich—whom the hon.

Member for Cathcart is so determined to tackle—are paying more not only in absolute terms but as a proportion of all taxes paid. The hon. Gentleman should be advised that it is the post-1983 manifesto that is on the line at present, not the old one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most telling comment came from the Labour party spokesman, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). When asked recently on "Frost on Sunday" about valuations, he admitted, "If we come to power, and if the valuations have been made, we may use them." That is something less than the grand endorsement that my hon. Friend the Minister of State might require, but in the circumstances it is probably as good as he will get. The system is good; it is better than the previous system; it is better than the rates; and I support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The old legal maxim that silence means consent would certainly not apply if the people of Wales were not heard on the subjects of banding and proportionality. I greatly admire the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire), and rarely disagree with him. However, fairness is the essence of the Opposition's argument. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, the proportionality as expressed in clause 5(1) is distinctly unfair. There is widespread dissatisfaction with the Government's proposals in the Principality and throughout the United Kingdom. The Government have created only eight bands in Wales, ranging, I think, from below £30,000 to about £240,000, which means that those in the upper bands will pay more proportionately than those in the lower bands. As set out in clause 5(1), the proportions show that people in the highest band—band H—will pay three times more than those in the lowest—band A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers may be aware that in 1989 the family expenditure survey showed that, nationally, the highest 10 per cent. income group had disposable incomes that were 7·5 times greater than those in the lowest 10 per cent. income group. The 1986 Green Paper showed that the average rateable value of properties in the lowest income band was 6·5 times greater than average income but that the average rateable value of those in the highest income band was only 1·25 times greater than their net income. That was a result of a system that valued each property separately—not in bands—and, not untypically produced twentyfold variation between the highest and lowest rateable values in a council area. Those figures clearly suggest that the range between the highest and the lowest bands should be substantially higher than set out in clause 5(1) of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Wales will recall that the Assembly of Welsh County Councils quite properly stated during the consultation process that from the evidence obtained it was not clear whether the proposed bands of property values would achieve an equitable distribution of the local tax burden. In other words, those bands will not reflect people's ability to pay the council tax. That was the fundamental flaw of the poll tax, and it is the fundamental flaw of this property poll tax. Worse, it will destroy people's confidence in any form of local government finance. Ultimately it was the public's perception of the unfairness of the poll tax that killed it. Collection of the poll tax, and of other taxes, will be increasingly more difficult to achieve in Wales, as it is in the rest of the country. The Government have a duty to get
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
it right now otherwise—this is my biggest fear—the credibility, not just of the taxation system but of local government will be put in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority associations in Wales collectively begged the Government to take disposable income as the main indicator of the ability to pay. The Government refused. They begged the Government, the Welsh Office, the Minister and the Secretary of State for Wales to commission an immediate research study into the relationship of household incomes and wealth with property capital values. They proposed detailed suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority associations also proposed a study using the last family expenditure survey, of capital values in relation to household gross incomes and disposable incomes based on 11,000 households in England and Wales. Incomes dated from the study can be compared with Inland Revenue office capital valuations of some or all of those households' domestic properties. They also suggested that the building society associations in Britain, particularly in Wales, could be asked to carry out a study into the precise relationships between the capital values of houses and the people living in them. The Government rejected that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the associations asked for a study to be undertaken jointly, between the Inland Revenue income tax and valuation offices, of the relationship between gross incomes and incomes net of income tax, with capital values prepared by the valuation office. The figures were easily available to the Welsh Office. They were also easily available to local authorities and yet again the Welsh Office refused to conduct those studies. Had it done so, the bands would be much fairer than those with which we are dealing today. That is why we shall table detailed amendments to change those bands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem in Wales, as in the rest of Britain, is that the Government have panicked. They have recoiled from their own deeply unpopular and hated poll tax. They are replacing one tax not linked to the ability to pay with another that has little connection with people's incomes. In the eyes of professionals, the bands are flawed. They are unfair in the eyes of the people and in Wales alone they will produce thousands of appeals to the new appeal tribunals. The Government should think again. If they do not, local government finance in Wales and in the rest of the country will be in the deepest trouble for decades to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like all other Conservative Members, who are sane and sensible. I shall oppose amendment No. 34. It takes us right back to the bad old days of the rating system, which none of us supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my concern lies well within the boundaries of the amendment and is shared with many people in rural Britain. In my constituency, more than 3,700 people are farmers. I want to make a small point and ask my hon. Friend the Minister for clarification. If it is not appropriate to make my point now, Sir Michael, I can table a probing amendment later. However, I prefer to raise the matter now and get ahead with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial issue for every farmer and his wife and family is how houses occupied by farmers and their staff will be valued for banding purposes. My hon. Friend the Minister does not need me to remind him that the General Rate Act 1967 made specific statutory provision for setting rateable values under the old rating system. It decreed that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
account had to be taken of the fact that farm houses are places of work as well as places where families live. In other words, it recognised that, when put on the open market, farm houses do not attract the same prices because they are offered as places of work surrounded by land. Unless such properties are split up from the land, losing the ability to be identified in the customary agricultural way, they do not command the same high prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special recognition of the importance of food production for our economy was made in the 1967 Act, and it resulted in a 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. reduction in the rateable value of farm houses—a substantial sum for small family farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government have responded to farmers' anxieties as expressed in correspondence. I have spoken about the issue. I understand that consideration has been given to making special statutory provision in the Bill to enshrine the special needs of farming families. That has not been deemed to be an appropriate way to react. Nevertheless, I am sure that Ministers share my understanding of the special circumstances of farming families, and they have stated that those circumstances will be taken into account in some way. Ministers and I know that many farm houses appear to be very large, but they are also store houses and meet many needs for farms. People cannot simply buy another smaller farm house because such houses are passed on from generation to generation—certainly not in the south-west of England. Some farmers in my constituency are about the eighth generation of a farming family. The own perhaps 200 acres and a farm house that is too large for today's use. The families are a little smaller than they used to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to clarify for myself and for many farmers who share my anxieties exactly how that difference will be recognised. I presume that it will be recognised by the valuation office, but such recognition must be laid down by the Minister making some declaration or statement. I accept that it may be a difficult and sensitive task. Generally, the farm house market is not very large. Only one, two or three farm houses may be for sale in a specific area. Comparisons will therefore be extraordinarily difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenant farmers' anxieties are especially important. We should understand their worries about tenancy agreements, which oblige them to live in a specific farm house or farm dwelling provided by the farmer. I share their worry about having to pay large bills because their employer cannot offer them a smaller dwelling. Some dwellings could be located in highly attractive—and therefore high value—parts of the country. I am not talking merely about the beauty of the countryside, but about economic viability in specific areas of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister, who I know shares my understanding of the problem, to set at rest both my mind and those of many thousands of farmers throughout the United Kingdom. I hope that he will give us grounds for confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, a Conservative Member made a claim on behalf of the banding system. He said that it would be easy for a potential house purchaser to decide whether he could afford a more expensive house as he would be able to judge whether he could move up the
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
band. Will the hon. Gentleman explain the validity of that point? Surely we can all remember property advertisements in the days of the rates. When a house was on the market, its rateable value formed part of the advertisement. People could easily and quickly decide whether they could afford the rates for a particular house. If that information was not included in the advertisement, it could easily be obtained from the estate agent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

A few years ago I moved into a Labour borough; the following year the Labour authority doubled my rates bill—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> What can the hon. Lady say about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not appear to realise that some local authorities adopt different attitudes and apply different judgments when deciding how public money should be spent and that people plight choose where to live, according to such criteria. I cannot help him if he is unable to do that. By and large, when higher rates are levied, there is a far better standard of service, but that is not always so. It is easy, however, to make those judgments for oneself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposed new system, people at the top end of the housing market can make a decision, no matter how expensive a house is, even if it costs £1 million or more. They can say to themselves, "Oh, good." It will not matter to them whether the value of a house in England is above £320,000, in Wales above £240,000 and in Scotland above £212,000. Nothing will restrain such a potential buyer other than his wish for ostentation and his wish to spend as much as he pleases. He will know that he does not pay his fair share towards local government expenditure and that the burden will be imposed on people who are far worse off than he is; even if he wished to pay his fair share, he could not do much about it. If he offered conscience money to the local authority, it would have to say that it was sorry but that it could not accept it. There is no heading under which such money could be received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past couple of days, especially this afternoon, we have seen Conservative Members getting worked up on behalf of householders who cannot afford improvements. They speak of "improvements" but they are on a scale that makes that word most inappropriate. A more appropriate word might be "reinventing" the house because the improvements are on such a vast scale. Conservative Members have loads of sympathy for such people and no sympathy at all, as my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) said, for the likes of student nurses. I do not know what student nurses must do to get sympathy from Conservative Members. Perhaps they have to win the pools and buy a big house. Then they will get all the sympathy in the world. Conservative Members have no sympathy at all for student nurses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It is a sore point in my constituency. The Government have cut not only cash aid but local authorities' ability to spend on major, serious house improvements such as re-roofing in Scotland. People who have waited desperately for a long time to make their houses habitable find that grants are unavailable because the councils are not able to give them. Not only are the Government paying no heed whatever to people's needs but they are letting otherwise good housing stock go to rack and ruin because their sympathies lie elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members seem convinced that the Labour party's proposals mean that people would have to pay more merely for adding a front dor to their house. I hope that the untruth of that has got through to them. They ought to read our proposals rather than Tory handouts that describe them. Ideally, we should read what the Tories say and discuss it and they should read what we say and discuss it. Perhaps we shall then make progress in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic error of the banding system is that the flattening of it will mean that no matter how wealthy a person is, at the top end he will pay only three times as much as someone at the bottom, although his income could be far higher than three times as much. Can the Minister say why the Government fixed a multiplier of three? It is all very well to say, as no doubt they will, that people who are wealthy pay higher national tax, but let me remind them once again that the top vluation—band H—uses different figures for England, Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am beginning to think that the Scottish Office has wrung a concession from the Treasury. A well-off Scot gets away with it above £212,000, but if a well-off person is unfortunate enough to be English, he has to wait for £320,000. I do not know why Ministers are not claiming greater credit for the deal they have created for Scottish millionaires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Property values in Scotland tend to be much lower than in England, which is no doubt why the top band in Scotland is £212,000. Also, because property values are generally lower in Scotland, people get much greater value for money when they buy a house for £212,000 because the pressure on property in England is so much greater. People can buy castles in Scotland for the price of some London flats, so Scottish millionaires will get a very fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are those illogicalities in the system, together with a complete failure to realise that a national taxing system could be so designed that people paid their fair share. Our system would ensure that people paid their fair share of national taxes and rates. If they were poor, they would be given concessions and rebates. If that were linked to the practice of individual valuations, there would be a sensible system—to which we shall return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government took a long time to learn that the poll tax was no good. Eventually their learning curve will improve and they will recognise that the proposed tax is no good, either. We shall win the election next year and return to the rates, and then we shall think that this was a bad dream.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday, I was 90 per cent. of the way through relating a story about my visit to Tilbury power station the other morning when I met someone who began

I made sure that that man understood that the Labour party was committed to bringing back a rating system that would be even more complex and costly to administer than the previous system.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That security guard at Tilbury power station was converted to the Government's policy because he understood that the Labour party wants to return to a system that amounts to an attack on, and a disincentive to, anyone who wishes to improve their house.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For me the most important factor in this debate is what is right for the people whom I represent in Thurrock. In 1988, I was faced with two options: the rating system, whose revaluations would have hit my constitutents far harder than the introduction of the community charge, or the community charge. I voted then for the better option: the community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I voted for the council tax on the Second Reading of this Bill, when I was once again faced with two options: the continuation of the community charge, or the replacement of it by the council tax. Given the spectrum of property values in my constituency, and having looked, using SSA spending, at what people would pay under the new tax compared with what they would pay under the community charge, it was right, given my constituents' interests, to vote for the council tax. I have no shame about that. Unlike the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), I always put the interests of my constituents first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the opposite of what has happened in Dagenham. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one compares the Government's proposed system with the Opposition's, it is in some ways rather difficult to be 100 per cent. sure of the answer because Opposition Members refuse to give precise figures about what people in individual constituencies would have to pay. They are hiding behind average figures, which are totally spurious, inaccurate and irrelevant. That provides no basis for the British people to arrive at a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) was getting at. It is reasonable to assume that the Opposition would land the people of Dagenham with what would be at least as bad as that which obtained before. The people of Thurrock would also have to pay more, if the Opposition were in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst aspect of the Opposition's proposals is that they would reintroduce a system that would amount to an attack on those who wished to improve their homes. In a constituency such as mine, out of a municipal housing stock of about 18,000, one third of those homes have been bought and there is great scope for people to make considerable improvements to their property. It would be a kick in the teeth for those people if they had to contend with the system advocated by the hon. Member for Dagenham. At least under the Conservative's proposals, people who spend money on improving their homes—either for their own benefit or for the benefit of others to whom they wish to pass the property later—will not be punished. The person who picks up the tab will be the one who buys the property; he will know what price he is paying and what tax band he will be in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Labour party's proposals there would be a revaluation. As I often tell my constituents, it would be a far more complicated revaluation, which would be used as an excuse to increase rateable values far beyond what they were under the old system. As always, the Labour party will hit middle England—people on middle incomes, living in three- and four-bedroomed semi-detached and detached houses. Those people will end up paying for the worst excesses of local government. Normally, those excesses can be identified and found in every Labour council throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to deal with the ridiculous utterances of the hon. Member for Cathcart during the past night, he tried to make out that an elderly widow would use more local government services than a family of four. If the object is to have an unlimited relationship between the amout paid and the ability to pay, there is only one logical solution—a local income tax, which we have already demolished with little difficulty. But if we are committed to some form of property tax—whether based on rateable values or capital values—it is ridiculous to pretend that there will be an accurate correlation between the value chosen as the benchmark and people's incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

We cannot pick out isolated instances of people living in specific properties and assume that there will be a straightforward correlation between the number of people and the services that they use. Collective provision of services requires collective assumptions on the normal ratio between the number of people in a property and the extent of local government services that they use. With a property tax, some basic assumptions must be made. Those assumptions will not be accurate in every application to every house in the country, but will usually be right when viewed through the telescope of common sense. It can be assumed that the occupants of a house worth £300,000 will usually have a higher income than the occupants of a house worth £50,000. It can also be assumed that if a house has four adult occupants and two or three children they will usually use more local government services than an elderly lady of 70 who lives alone. There may be exceptions and, as the hon. Member for Cathcart postulated yesterday, an elderly occupant living alone may make greater use of local government services than a family of four, but that would be unusual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In support of my hon. Friend, perhaps he would remind the Opposition that, under the present Government, people's health has improved dramatically as a result of the increased expenditure on health and that elderly people, especially women, are living much longer. With care in the community they will, increasingly, live at home and be looked after there. My hon. Friend's comments are wholly valid in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a fair and valid assumption that, if only one person lives in a property, that person is likely to use fewer services than three or four people living in one property. It is right that our proposed 25 per cent. discount should be available to single occupants. If the Labour party ever has the chance to implement its proposals, single people—whether a 30-year-old man living alone or a 75-year-old lady living alone—will be hammered again, as they always were under the rating system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue that argument because, later, we shall discuss a rebate system, which would be fairer and would counter the argument of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman).

I rose with trepidation, because we are approaching the happy hour, which is always a difficult time in Committee. That reminds me of a story about a man who went into a pub having passed another man hanging around the entrance to the pub. The man ordered a pint of beer and when the landlord asked him for 4p, he said, "How can it cost 4p in these days of a Tory Government?" The landlord replied, "Today is the 300th anniversary of our opening and that was the price then." The man then asked why the other man was hanging around at the entrance and was told that he was waiting for the happy hour.

That is what is happening with local taxes. There is a big prize to be had, but if the Tories were re-elected at the general election, local government bills would increase to a higher level than previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment would restore the concept of rateable values, which is fairer than the Government's banding system. The bands create severe problems and the amendment provides the opportunity to discuss them. Similar properties in different areas could be in widely different bands and people will compare their properties with others and will shout at what they think is unfair. There seems to be no commonsense link between what people think their own property is worth compared with others. That is particularly so in view of the Minister's comment last evening that the bands will be set at April 1991 valuations. That means the banding will become out-dated, and the unfairness will increase. All that will lead to many appeals. My own property could well find itself on the border of a band. If I am put in the wrong band, I shall appeal, as will many constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Incomes will not be taken into account for banding, so unfairness will again creep in because households with widely differing incomes will be in the same bands. That will restore the flat-rate tax element—the poll tax—that many found so unfair. The banding is regressive because it works against poorer people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also sharp discontinuity on the border of bands. For example, there might be a £20,000 valuation differential between bands. A property at the bottom of a specific band might be valued at £20,000 less than a property at the top but the owner of the former property will pay the same tax. On the border of those bands a property might have a value differential of just £1,000 but it would be in a higher band. The Government have
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
allowed that unfairness to creep in. A property that is five minutes' journey time nearer the shops than a similar property down the road would be put into a different band and attract a larger valuation. There will be sharp increases in what people whose property is at band edges will pay.

The Department of the Environment's valuations for London seem wrong. Research done by the London Research Centre calls into account three different reports—a London housing survey report, and those from the Halifax building society and the Building Societies Association. They show that whereas the Government claim that 55 per cent. of London's properties are expected to have a value in excess of £88,000, the true percentage is more likely to be 35 per cent. That is massively different from the Government's calculations, and will mean higher bills for Londoners.

There is also a problem with regional variations in house prices. Research by the LRC showed that, from 1983 to 1987, London's house prices rose by 101 per cent. whereas in the west Midlands house prices rose by 37 per cent. only, but that between 1987 and 1990 they levelled. Fixing the banding at the April 1991 level could, as the survey showed, work unfairly for London and the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LRC survey also compared regional banding to the proposed national banding distribution, with a regional banding based solely on greater London average prices. The percentage of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
