	<br><blockquote><p>'() In this Chapter any powers given to the Secretary of State to designate an authority shall not apply if that authority has complied with section 32 above or in the case of a major precepting authority section 43 above.'.—	<i>[Mr. Gould.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Sir Michael, and good morning to the whole Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will recall that when I was speaking at just before 2 o'clock this morning, I was referring to Labour's approach to local and central Government. I dealt with the subject extensively in my speech, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who was often cross-examined by Conservative Members. Our approach mainly comprises restoring the partnership between local government and central Government and restoring trust in local government by using circulars and by calling in local authorities to discuss central strategy and ways in which the partnership between local and central Government can best be forged and put into effect. Overall economic control will be maintained by central Government control of the grant to local authorities. I hope that that will mean that local government will receive more grant under a Labour Government than it has received under a Conservative Government, and that the grant will be better distributed to areas in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of our approach is annual local elections, which will make councils much more accountable than they are now, or have been over the past 12 years—even though the Government claim that accountability has been one of their objectives. When the Government introduced the poll tax, for example, the opposite of accountability resulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I outlined our approach in some detail last night and I allowed many interventions in my speech. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham also allowed many interventions. The Labour party objects to arbitrary capping, because it is fundamentally anti-local democracy. The amendment is all about capping. Conservative Members had their fun last night by cross-examining my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham, who stood up to it very well. Now it is up to the Government to justify why they again want to push ahead with capping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth repeating the three short quotations that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) used in her speech at about half-past one last night. I do not like to repeat what has already been said, but this will not take much of the Committee's time. My hon. Friend was right to use those quotations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
The first was from 	<i>The Times,</i> in its leader of 14 June 1991, which described capping as
	<br><blockquote><p>"an offence against local democracy far more outrageous than anything M. Delors is proposing for monetary and political union."</p></blockquote>
That is a damning comment by a newspaper that is not sympathetic to Labour—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will not go through all the quotations that we heard last night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely not, Sir Michael.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have we not had the same quotation three times, rather than different quotations on the same point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are brief quotations, and I should like to read them to the Committee in the cold light of day, because I think that they should be allowed to inform this morning's debate. The second quotation was from the present Secretary of State for the Environment, who in July 1979, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will sweep away tiresome and excessive control over local government. Local councils are directly elected. They are answerable to their electorate. They do not need, they do not want, the fussy supervision of detail that now exists."</p></blockquote>
In an article in 	<i>The Times</i> on 10 May 1990, the Secretary of State wrote, that capping would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"an act of centralised power outside our experience. On those grounds alone it should be resisted."</p></blockquote>
I have now finished repeating quotations from last night, Sir Michael, and I am sorry that I have stretched your patience. However, they are important quotations, because they show clearly that the Secretary of State is the man behind the clause and the capping process. He has changed his tune, as have the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capping does not protect poll tax payers, and it will not protect council tax payers, from high bills. Poll tax payers have not been protected from high bills overall as some examples will show. The Government estimated that the average poll tax would be £178, but that figure was subsequently revised to £278, and later for 1990–91 to £357—an increase of well over 100 per cent. Some authorities had amazingly high poll tax bills: Windsor and Maidenhead and Elmbridge set bills of £449, and Epsom and Ewell bills of £452. Strangely, none of those authorities was capped, even though the Government claim that capping is designed to protect local poll tax payers from high bills. When Conservative-controlled areas such as Windsor and Maidenhead, Elmbridge, and Epsom and Ewell set high bills, they were not capped. Boroughs such as Calderdale, where the poll tax bill was only £296, Barnsley, where it was £329, and Doncaster and Rotherham, where it was £334, were all capped and labelled as spendthrift, yet their bills were much lower. The excuse that capping was introduced to curb high bills does not stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government argue that capping is essential to protect council tax payers. We should examine the reasons for high poll tax bills because the causes of high bills will continue under the council tax. There are five main reasons why poll tax bills have been high. The Government assumed a 100 per cent, collection rate, yet even the Prime Minister has now said that the tax is almost uncollectable, and certainly not 100 per cent, collectable. The safety net arrangements introduced by the Government added £75 to some people's bills. In my borough, every poll tax payer in Waltham Forest paid an extra £42—in effect to Wandsworth, which received a subsidy of over £100 per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
bill in the same year. The Government considerably underestimated the amount that local authorities would need to spend in 1990–91: the difference between the spending assumptions made in the RSG report and the local authorities' existing spending plans was so great that it resulted in high bills, as the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy confirmed. All those factors will be carried forward into the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a big argument in Committee yesterday about standard spending assessments and my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham gave a few examples of SSS. Basildon is a classic example, where the SSA included only a fraction of its actual debt charges. That results in high bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make what may be a small point, but it should be on the record. The Government did not underestimate what local authorities needed to spend; the Government underestimated what local authorities decided and budgeted to spend. Those are two very different things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes his point, but Basildon had no choice about debt charges. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it should not have paid the interest charges? His friends in the City might take a different view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. What I put to the hon. Gentleman is an undisputed fact which will be confirmed by Councillor Paddy Tipping, the Labour chairman of the council's finance committee. He said that, because his authority was not up for an election, it budgeted to spend, over a four-year period, an extra £104 million over its previous expenditure. That worked out at an extra £147 for every adult in the county. It was additional spending for "improved services"—Councillor Tipping used the euphemistic phrase so common to local authorities. God help us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was referring to Basildon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to Nottingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that councillors must be accountable at the ballot box. I said earlier that the capping system distorts that accountability. The Government should be anxious about that because it is easy for a Labour councillor to say, "This is not our budget or our bill. This is the Conservatives' bill—they capped us, they are making the cuts." That removes accountability, which would be the best protection in circumstances like those in Nottingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basildon had debt charges in 1991–92 of £7,855,000. The SSA for those debt charges was £1,4646,000. That meant that Basildon spent £6,409,000 more than allowed for by the SSA, or 53 per cent, of the total SSA. When SSAs are so ridiculously out of sync, it will result in higher bills. The effect of new legislation was another reason for higher bills, as administration costs were higher than expected. That is why poll tax bills were higher than planned, and those reasons will apply, too, to the council tax. Instead of tackling the problems, the Government propose capping, which is arbitrary. There is no realistic opportunity to state why the bills are so high. If the Government let those reasons out into the open, they would have to find the necessary funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
The briefing note issued by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities in February 1990 about the difficulties involved in poll tax capping is relevant to the proposed council tax capping. The briefing document stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Once an authority has had a lower poll tax—</p></blockquote>
council tax could be substituted now—
	<br><blockquote><p>"imposed by Order or has accepted the Secretary of State's proposal it will have to:
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) recalculate its budget in order that income matches expenditure. Section 114 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 requires the Treasurer to make a special report if an authority's proposed expenditure does not match its resources. Vague 'efficiency savings to be realised later' would probably not be legally sufficient."</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
Then an authority will have to
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) re-bill poll tax payers".</p></blockquote>
The Government know only too well the problem of doing that. In fact, this year, they had to set up a special fund to help local authorities, which had to pulp all their bills and send out new ones showing the new charge. The briefing document then stated an authority will have to
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) re-calculate schedules of instalments, where payment has begun</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) make refunds where poll taxes have been paid in one lump sum</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(e) recalculate poll tax rebate entitlements."</p></blockquote>
That is an administrative nightmare.
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990, the Association of Metropolitan Authorities said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities feel that this aspect has been ignored by the DOE."</p></blockquote>
It quotes an extract from a report by a treasurer to the AMA following a visit to the Department of the Environment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A representative from the D.O.E. visited on 29th January, 1990 to discuss progress with my Chief Rating Officer and although it was a pleasant hour's discussion it seemed quite obvious that the D.O.E. don't live in the real world. When 'capping' was mentioned the D.O.E. representative was shocked when informed that the replacement bills would take three months to issue with no cash coming in the meantime. He obviously didn't realise that paper needs to be ordered, stationery designed, software amended, rebates and transition re-calculated, bills printed, folded, collated and envelopes. I'm sure he thought that some magician would appear overnight to resolve these problems."</p></blockquote>
That is a scathing attack on the Department of the Environment for capping local authorities and believing that local authorities can handle it, without it imposing an enormous extra burden. Clearly, the Department of the Environment has not learnt anything from the last round of capping because that note from the AMA is as relevant today on council tax capping as it was in relation to poll tax capping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capping powers are fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-local democracy. They give the Secretary of State enormous, centralised powers. Indeed, in June this year, the Association of District Councils described the powers as "shockingly centralist". The Secretary of State has taken all the power unto himself. The criterior for capping is that if the Secretary of State considers that an authority's budget is excessive or represents an excessive increase on the previous year's he can cap it. The situation will be the same as it was with the poll tax, whereby an authority levying a lower council tax may be capped and one levying a higher tax will not be, just because that is what the Secretary of State considers should happen. There is an appeal process, but, again, that is just an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
appeal to the Secretary of State. So, he really has taken all the power—dictatorial power—unto himself. No wonder the ADC described it as "shockingly centralist".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to the Conservative party newspaper "Newsline" in March 1984, Rosalie Mondiot, then leader of South Oxfordshire district council said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What we are concerned about is that this ill thought out bill will … constitutionally damage the recognised right of local authorities to levy their own rates and to be accountable in a local democratically elected manner".</p></blockquote>
It was recognised by Conservative councillors, when capping was first mooted by the Conservative party that it is against local accountability and against democracy. It is a gross interference by the Secretary of State in the freedom of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In electoral terms, it does not seem to make a jot of difference. Most of the councillors on capped authorities are re-elected; their election prospects are not damaged by capping. Generally, it is the people's perception of whether a council is doing a good job—and, perhaps, whether they hate the Government—not the capping itself that decides elections. The damage done by the Government in such circumstances is not borne out in electoral terms. We should return to local accountability instead of bludgeoning it. Let the people see that their local authorities are responsible for services and for their cost. Let them decide what level of bill they want against what level of service. That was once the tradition, but over the past 15 or 16 years, or even longer, Governments have been hostile to local government. It is time to move back to that partnership to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who reads 	<i>Hansard</i> will see that Conservative Members cannot conceive of local and central Government working in partnership. Local councils have to be nailed down. That has not worked, so the Government are extending those undemocratic capping powers to more local authorities, usually resulting in services being cut. That has not worked. It is against local democracy. It is time that it was abandoned and Labour's alternative was adopted in its stead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Burt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important subject. Despite the strictures of the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) about our pursuit of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), the Opposition are offering a pig in a poke. Either there will be no control of local authority spending at all, which will please the local authorities, or the local electorate is being told that some control will be exercised, although there will be no capping. Perhaps that control will be exercised through the trust that the hon. Member for Leyton said so much about yesterday. Conservative Members' only aim was to pursue the hon. Member for Dagenham to discover on which side of the line he stood. He cannot stand on both sides at the same time, although that is a popular occupation on the Labour Front Bench, but it will not work in this case. However, the answers last night gave Conservative Members and the population at large no clear idea of the Labour party's policy on the control of local expenditure. We have no choice but to conclude that there will be very little control, that spending will be let rip and that the problems encountered in the 1970s will re-emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capping and control are serious matters. All hon. Members who have been involved in local government are inevitably interested in the level of central Government direction. There are important matters of local democracy to be resolved. Local democracy is devalued when
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
Opposition Members such as the hon. Members for Leyton and for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) measure electoral success in terms of the Government's performance, rather than that of local councillors. Too often, local elections are about not local but central Government issues. People should have a true choice about local issues. That is what local authorities should be about. In the 1970s, as Labour local authorities began to have ever-more extensive policies about foreign and other matters, it was not surprising that the electorate's eye was distracted from the local ball.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let what the hon. Gentleman said about local elections not being about local matters go by. It depends on what level the election is held. In town council elections, for instance, the issues are local. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. In 1988, we were told that the poll tax was needed to promote local accountability and to enable people to decide. If local issues do not affect local elections, why did we get the poll tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is looking through rose-coloured spectacles if he believes that local issues predominate in local government elections. They do not. All opinion surveys show that the major determinant of local voting is what is happening nationally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trapping himself in a catch-22 situation. He may be right to say that local elections should be about local issues but increasingly the Government have, through rate capping, taken power away from local authorities and transferred it to central Government. Is it not then inevitable that local elections will be decided on what central Government are doing? The hon. Gentleman should not pursue that argument too far, because he cannot win with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's advice, but it is a matter of degree. Most people feel that local authorities have plenty of room to interfere and to do their work perfectly well, but that they chose to concentrate on other matters at election time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the electorate only sees what is happening in local matters when the sheer ghastliness of certain regimes, especially in London, bursts through at the time of local elections? That is when the voters show that they will take no more. However, national issues predominate on almost every other occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possibly true—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> If members of the Committee would listen to my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans), they would find that I agree with him. Remarkable interest is shown in local matters at election time only when a local council is associated with something astonishingly bad, as with some London Labour authorities, or with something astonishingly good, as, for example, Wandsworth. I hope that I am talking about something in which all members of the Committee are interested in. I would like greater emphasis to be placed on local issues at local elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfair for Opposition Members to dress up their opposition to capping, to throw up their hands in horror and imply that they will give local authorities much more freedom. My friend the former councilllor, Albert Little,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
who represented Ramsbottom urban development corporation for many years and who was leader of Bury council carries with him, to this day, a copy of the famous DOE circular issued in 1977. It describes the cuts that he was to make in local authority services. They were serious cuts necessary because of the mess in which the Labour Government found themselves. He would not be taken in by the Labour party's sudden conversion to the belief that local authorities should have the freedom to spend what they wish, and neither should we be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How should central Government control local authorities? Capping is drastic. It should be used only as a last resort. Authorities should know what the guidelines are. SSAs vary in quality. We must find a better method to assess local authorities' needs, but local authorities must also help themselves. Bury has the smallest metropolitan authority in the country. It has overspent for many years and since 1986, when the council went Labour, its overspending has increased significantly.

My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Sumberg) and I have been on delegations to the Department of Environment to talk about SSAs. We cannot resolve the matter because the compilation of SSAs requires the involvement of local authority associations, which have vested interests. The same factors that work against a small authority, such as Bury, may work in favour of larger authorities, such as Liverpool or Manchester. The degree of common interest necessary to change SSAs and to help authorities, such as mine, does not exist. It is not fair simply to land all the blame on the Government for any failure or error in the SSAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be some inaccuracy in setting SSAs, but does my hon. Friend agree that some SSAs are too generous while others are not generous enough? If a review were carried out, it may be found that some local authorities are being given too generous an SSA and, therefore, too much taxpayers' money through revenue support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that intervention from my hon. Friend. I am pleased to see him in his seat. I know that he will remain there for many years, despite whatever parodies of the truth are produced in socialist newspapers such as this morning's 	<i>Daily Mail.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend makes a valid point. If SSAs can be inaccurate, they can be inaccurate both ways. Some may be too generous and others are not generous enough. However, it is not fair for local authorities to be affected by inaccurate information. We must find a better method to assess the needs of local authorities. Only then will it become clear that central Government capping is fair and straightforward. Guidelines would be clearly set, local authorities would know what they had to do to stay within the rules and those rules would be seen, by all sides, to be fair. I do not resile in any way, from the agreement that central Government should ultimately have that control and that local authorities that diverge from the rules harm themselves and harm those that they represent. The combination, in the 1970s, of high-spending local authorities and inflation led to the crisis in local government with which we have been living ever since. We should take whatever steps we can to put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the latest census will enable us to overhaul SSAs thoroughly and ensure that they are more accurate.
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
The Government are entitled to keep the system, but I hope that in time its apparent injustices will be addressed, so that we have a more straightforward and clear method of controlling local government finance. It is far better to know where one stands—as the Conservative party does—on the issue of Government control, than to have a policy that is vague and unclear, and that tries to be all things to all men. Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen have shown throughout the debate that they have such a policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee and of the House, and now, I think, the public at large, are getting a little tired of the Government always throwing back at them untypical cases such as that of Lambeth as a justification for their use of wide-ranging powers against all local authorities. One should never argue from the particular to the general, yet for several years that has been the Government's only way to respond to the issue of local government finance. Whenever I hear Conservative Members mention the word Lambeth, I know that it is because they cannot come up with any better argument to justify the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not need any better argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. If the Government are arguing that the basis of a 163-page Bill—including chapter V, which is the central plank of the financing of local government—is one local authority, they bring their own reputation, and that of those working in local government on behalf of the Conservative party, into disrepute. There are hundreds of local authorities and they should surely be examined as a whole and systems devised that are in the best interests of the majority. The Government should not just take powers to direct against one or two local authorities, even if, as we may all agree, those authorities could do better. If that is the basis of the Government's argument, we are wasting our time in Committee. I should be interested to know whether the Government have any other arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that if it had been a case of merely the five London boroughs and perhaps the Liverpool of a few years ago, the Government could simply have let the problem burn itself out, as they would have done. However, as I said late last night, at the point of changeover from the rates to the poll tax, the excess spending, over and above the increase that was necessary to cover inflation, was £2,500 million. It was not just a case of a few London boroughs—there was overspending right across the board. My local authority does not fall into the category that we used to describe as the "loony left", yet it also put up its charges massively after having overspent. It is not just the Lambeths and the Hackneys that are involved; that is why capping was necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. I think that I need to respond in detail to the hon. Gentleman, and to the other members of the Committee who have served in local government. During the 1970s and the 1980s, there was a clear progression towards reducing services in local government. The reason for that was, of course, that demand for local services was increasing because, among other factors, there were more elderly people, demanding more day care from social services departments and more meals on wheel services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason, in education, was that there was a decline in the 1980s in the school population, although not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
in all parts of the country. In my area of East Sussex, there was an increase, which meant that that county council needed to spend more. At the same time, knowledge was evolving and, as in the health service where advanced technology enhanced the capability to deliver new services, in local government people learnt that they could respond more to local communities. In transport, for example, many rural areas, especially in Sussex, were deprived of public bus services. Local authorities could provide those residents with transport to take them into nearby small towns to do their shopping, by contributing towards bus services. If the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) is suggesting that local authorities should not respond to such matters, the logical conclusion would be that local authorities would do nothing at all. They are there to respond to their local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are moving away from the particular, Lambeth, towards the general by saying that they want to curb all local authorities in their provision of services, it is not surprising that throughout the 1980s when the public had an opportunity to give their opinion at local government elections, they moved substantially away from support of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in East Sussex were asked regularly throughout the 1980s whether they supported this step, and they clearly responded that they did not. At the last local election in the Rother district, local peopled decided not to re-elect the Conservative council and the council has now been formed by colleagues from my party. Exactly the same happened in the Lewes district—the Conservatives were kicked out because of those issues. In Brighton, my Labour party colleagues took advantage of the local view of the Conservative party. [HON. MEMBERS: "Colleagues?"] I am being objective. Out of seven districts in East Sussex, the Conservatives lost three during the 1980s. They then lost Eastbourne this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 53 will bring parish councils into the situation. There is such opposition to the Conservatives that there have been extreme examples of people turning away from them in this year's council elections. The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) spoke last night of her constituents' view of the Conservative party. In my constituency, the council of the parish town of Polegate was contested by political parties for the first time ever this year. It had previously been served by Conservative independents and when the public had the opportunity to say what they wanted for their services in Polegate, all 17 seats returned Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for that information. I am sure that it will not be long before the Conservatives lose those three as well, because things are moving in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
I have attempted to make a fair and objective analysis of the public's opinion. Clause 53 is an evil reversal of accountability. Having been elected throughout the 1980s and taken the public's view of the service levels that they want local government to provide, the Government then said, "We do not like all these election results going against us, so we will stop local authorities delivering the very services that the public have elected them to deliver". Although people have made their choice at the ballot box, democracy will be taken from them because the Government will decide here in Westminster that local authorities, which have held free elections, will no longer be able to deliver the services that they have put before the people in their manifestos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent six years on a town council, 12 years on a district council and 10 years on a county council and I know what the Government think of local government. They do not like it, they want to get rid of it and if they cannot do that, they want to control it totally. It is all very well for the Government to bring forward yet another form of finance for local government, but there is nothing in the Bill about belief in the delivery of local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 53 is probably the worst clause in the Bill. It will continue the theme of centralisation and it will give the Secretary of State draconian powers. If Conservative Members were frank with the Committee, they would accept that the SSA system is in disrepute. No one can look at the detail of its operation and argue that it is fair. In every area it throws up such disparities that no one can understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some years in East Sussex, local authorities of all political persuasions, other than Hove, have looked at the SSAs and asked how Hove has got away with such a generous assessment. Hove is not substantially different from many of the other boroughs and districts in East Sussex, yet it comes out of the procedure much better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the 1980s, on two consecutive occasions Hove borough council did not need to levy a district rate. That is extraordinary. The people who lived in Hove were not asked for a contribution to local services, yet people in the other districts had to contribute. There is something wrong with a system that produces such results. There were no more single-person households in Hove than in Brighton or Eastbourne. The indicators that were thrown together just happened to produce a situation that, added to the money that Hove borough council had on deposit for historical reasons, meant that it did not need to levy a rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hove and Brighton have a common border. People living on one side of Brunswick place in Brighton paid high rates to Brighton, because Brighton borough council did not have any assets, and people on the other side of the road contributed nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have just picked one county, East Sussex, in which there are only seven local authorities and I am mentioning them all. There are other areas of the country where the argument also applies.

	<span class='label label-info column'>817</span>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South and other hon. Members talked about their areas. The same situation occurs across the country and the Government should think again. The clause will be based on SSAs. The powers that will be taken will be on the basis of SSAs. If one starts off with a false base, any powers used will be unfair and will add further to the feeling of local government that central Government do not want to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the situations that might lead to the Secretary of State using those powers. One example is a county council in our area, but it could apply to others—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members laugh when I give exact examples. They like to talk about the general and do the horrendous. That suits their ways. If one gives specific examples, they are forced either not to answer them or to look at the answers and not like them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
East Sussex county council will incur costs next year and the year after for the provision of probation services and magistrates courts. That may result in the closure of magistrates courts at Hailsham and Hove and centralisation to Lewes, or the county council will be faced with high expenditure that it cannot afford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us talk particulars, if that is what the hon.

I wonder whether the people of Eastbourne are aware that he is now launching an attack on the system that produced such a result for his constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Around the time of that increase, the Conservative-led administration on Eastbourne borough council needed some hope for the future because it was going down the tubes electorally, which it did anyway. Despite the fact that the SSA was, in the Minister's words, the highest in the country, it will not have escaped the Committee's notice that that had absolutely no effect on the by-election, which is why I am able to speak here this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way when I finish this point. The consequence of that increase did not have the intended effect because, as people in my constituency know, it was long overdue. One reason for the increase was an acknowledgement by the Government, which was overdue and went only halfway to meeting the needs, of areas that needed to invest in tourism. An increase for tourism made up a substantial part of the general increase to which the Minister referred. The wealth of an area such as Eastbourne depends on its economy, which depends on tourism. The capping proposed in the clause would limit the money that areas such as Eastbourne could spend on tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) confessed to the Committee that he thought that it was unnecessary for his local authority to spend money on tourism. That is extraordinary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman is in a queue. I shall give way with pleasure when I finish this point, which links up with what the Minister said about the increase and the powers in the clause that I oppose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding amazed me. I am sure that many members of the Committee have appreciated the tourism opportunities in his constituency, particularly during the spring when the bulbs are delightful. I recall a bus trip through Spalding when I was able to look at the tulips. The hon. Gentleman may suggest that his local authority should not spend money to advertise the attractions of his district, but I make no apology for wanting to attract tourists to Eastbourne. It is important that the local authority is allowed to spend money on attracting tourism, otherwise our economy will be even worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to become embroiled in arguments about tulips from Eastbourne or anywhere else. The hon. Gentleman was uncharacteristically ungenerous to the Minister in trying to link an increase in SSAs with Eastbourne's electoral position. He knows that no individual levers can be pulled in relation to local authorities through SSAs. One of the strengths of the system is the fact that it is not open to such electoral abuse. Does the hon. Gentleman hope for a change in the system? Does he want a better-targeted political system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman genuinely believes what he has just said, but perhaps he should examine the record. I hope that the Minister will exhibit his normal fairness of mind and confirm that some areas of the country were treated as special cases and received extra help that allowed them to spend money to promote tourism. The hon. Member for Bury (Mr. Burt) may believe what he said, but the final calculation for this financial year included an extra settlement for tourist areas. That was the subject of a question that I asked the Secretary of State on the Floor of the House some time ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The allowance for tourist areas is made in recognition of the fact that tourists impose costs on the local authority by parking cars, dropping litter and so on. The local authority can choose to spend the money on promoting tourism. That is its own affair. But the money is provided in recognition of the extra costs imposed by tourists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And that was increased last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I increased that and it benefited all authorities, such as Eastbourne, that have many tourists staying overnight. Equally, Camden in central London did very well out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reconsiders his attack upon my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but if Conservative Members imagine that that was an attack, they have not yet seen me in full flow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
However, the record of last night's proceedings will show that the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding, when pressed about where cuts in local government spending in his area should fall, spoke about tourism. That word was used. I was not asleep, but stored that piece of information away for use today to demonstrate the difference between Conservative Members, who do not believe in spending money through local authorities, and those of us who wish to promote economic well-being in their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These draconian powers would stop much of that spending on tourism. They would also stunt some of the economic growth that the country needs. That runs counter to much of what the Government pretend to want to promote. In my area, we desperately need a new roads infrastructure system. The A22 running down through the county to the coast is blocked all summer. Development is expected to be complete in the next few years. To achieve that, Eastbourne has had to allocate a large part of the budget for this year and the next two years. The Bill would make it more difficult for Eastbourne borough to meet its financial contributions towards that road, whose development is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government use the capping powers as has been suggested, local councillors in Eastbourne will no longer be able to tell local business rate payers and local council taxpayers that their votes in the next local elections would allow the council to spend money to help to ensure that the new road system brings wealth into the town. People will vote for such a proposal, but then the Government will cap, and it will not be possible to build those new roads. Wealden district council, in east Sussex, has special problems because it has a large rural area. Transport between villages would be almost non-existent without the district council subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are special problems involved in trying to provide housing for young families to stay in the villages. So many young people in the Wealden area have to leave their village community because there is nowhere for them to live when they get married and have children. Without the district council's help in setting up housing projects in villages, young people cannot stay there, so they move to Brighton, Croydon or even to London because they cannot bring up children in the village in which they and their parents and grandparents may have lived throughout their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those costs are important. The proposed powers will mean that Wealden, a prudent local authority, will be looking for a £400,000 reduction next year and who knows what when the council tax is in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say a word about the position of parish councils under chapter V, clause 53. Residents of rural areas and small towns and those who serve on parish councils do not see them as bodies that spend a lot of money—that is my experience of the councils in Sussex, and I am sure that it is true of other areas. People on parish councils want to serve their local community and to respond to community needs. Few parish councillors follow a party-political banner. In Sussex, sometimes it was difficult to know which party the parish councillors voted for at elections. The powers in chapter V which, for the first time, could be used against parish councils will be perceived as unfair and unnecessary. Can the Government give any examples to justify the powers? Has any parish council anywhere in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
country deliberately taken a programme or project from a district or borough council because it wanted to get round the local government regulations? I cannot find one example of that, nor can the Government. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is about to leave. Is he going to look for an example, or an adequate answer? I shall give way if the Government have an answer. If they do not, perhaps it demonstrates that the powers are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers will catch parish councils that decide once every 10 years to have a major project, which usually involves the construction of a village hall, or a sports or community centre. Often, the decision is taken to have a higher precept that year—Ministers are retiring for coffee rather than responding to my important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I am present and I take exception to the hon. Gentleman's remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Michael. The record will show that on two or three occasions I have asked Ministers for an example that would explain why they want to take these powers against parish councils and that they have failed to provide one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my point about one-off, exceptional expenditure by parish councils. In Polegate, there is a fine council chamber which doubles as a community hall. It is used by a pre-school play group and by senior citizens' clubs every day of the week. Attached to it is a playing field which has been provided by the town council. That involved fairly high expenditure over a period of one or two years, but the expenditure level has now dropped back because the council now has only the running costs instead of the capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Barcombe, which is a parish in Sussex, the county council is prepared to contribute a proportion towards a village sports hall and the district council another small proportion, leaving the majority of the cost to be borne by the parish council. I have been a governor of a fine primary school that has 91 pupils but no school hall. The most cost-effective way forward is for the county council to contribute towards a new sports hall, so that the school can use it, and for the district to make a contribution so that sports activites can be generated within the village. It is a deprived village because of transport difficulties. The parish would contribute the rest of the money. All the parishioners have been looking forward to the facility for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draconian powers in the clause mean that by the time the partners in this excellent venture have covered the cost—most will be met by the residents of Barcombe—the Government could stop it. I was disturbed last night when the Minister said that although £5 or £10 a head might be acceptable for a parish council, £25 or £30 a head was not. That is exactly the sum needed from parishioners to provide a sports hall or a community centre. It would be outrageous if community-minded people who want to serve their parishes, mostly on a non-party basis, find that they cannot provide the very facility that their rural community requires.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
I am disappointed that the Minister has not dealt with the issue. The Government could stop a parish council such as Barcombe from providing a sports hall. In the course of a generation, that could apply to almost every village. It will not apply every year. There will not be an enormous aggregate that will affect national public expenditure. All villages will not choose to build in the same year. However, over a period, every village will lose the opportunity of providing a community or sports centre. The issue is important and I am extremely disappointed that there has been no response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may be a small point, but we should not lose sight of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live in a village that fits the description given by the hon. Gentleman. We have always been limited by what used to be called the tuppenny rate concept, but it has not stopped our village community from saying that if we need more money than we are allowed to have via the district and county council, we will raise it in the village. That is what we have done. We have a marvellous community hall that was built from funds raised in the village. That gets round the problems of local taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I empathise with his views on the way rural communities raise funds for community projects. Evidence shows that that happens throughout the country. Fund raising in Barcombe over many years has provided a swimming pool for local school pupils and a subsidy towards all sorts of excellent projects, but it is difficult to ask a village of 700 or 800 people to provide £200,000 for a major building project. That is an enormous per capita sum. It has to be linked to the grants available from the county and district council. If parishes had to do all their own fund raising for such worthy projects rather than percept for the money, that would take away the fairness of sharing the burden of cost across the community. Such a system would rely on those who were prepared to contribute doing the work, while others sat back. We must design a combination of systems. It would be draconian to take away the opportunity from a village to raise funds for a project, and would run against everything that Britain stands for. Projects have always been created at the grass roots—in our local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have given us no idea of the limits that should apply to parish councils. Apart from the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding, no one has given a list of the things that districts and boroughs should or should not do. We must oppose the clause because it would mean the end of local government as we know it. The record will show the Government's appalling disregard for the debate on this subject and their inability to give adequate responses. It is a sad day for our local communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to take part in the debate, but the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) raised some important matters. The issue of non-accountability by the electorate on local matters was not covered— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Do I see a stranger in the Committee, I must ask him to leave immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I feel that, because of some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Bury, North, we should discuss metropolitan areas. The debate has centred on shire county areas. Some of the comments have been constructive, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the formula used for capping authorities' expenditure should be reviewed. The capping system is weighted against certain authorities. Yesterday, I said that if some authorities do not use their precept for the provision of services, the Government should consider redistribution of the revenue support grant and the unified business rate to areas where a genuine need to provide services exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should reconsider the capping procedures. Perhaps earlier formulas for constraining local government expenditure should be considered. Clause 53(1) says that the designation of authorities applies to all relevant precepting authorities applies to all relevant precepting authorities and, in metropolitan areas, to police authorities and fire authorities. Capping can have far-reaching effects on communities. Chief constables have made representations to Ministers about the effects of capping on police service budgets. They have said that fewer civilians will be employed in the courts and in administrative posts, and that uniformed police will have to take on civilian jobs. That will further reduce the number of police on the beat in streets and precincts and other shopping areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When chief constables make such representations to the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for the Environment, the situation is serious. The clause will do nothing to relieve the problems that have developed as a result of capping. The Government should reconsider the matter. The amendment would help to ease such problems and relieve the anxieties of police and fire authorities in metropolitan areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you, Sir Michael, live in west Yorkshire, you may be aware that senior officers in the West Yorkshire police and fire authorities have expressed anxieties about the cuts that would result from capping. Last year, they made unsuccessful representations. However, this year there has been a slight change, and I look forward to hearing from the chief Constable how that will affect the budget in the coming year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend used similar arguments about the police on several occasions during debate on the poll tax Bill. He will know that Welsh police authorities face similar problems to those in Yorkshire. Only one additional police constable has been awarded to my authority of Gwent. If more constables are employed, the authority will risk being capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what metropolitan and city areas fear. Capping creates difficulties for the police, who provide security in communities that need such security, now more than ever. From brief consultations with the chairman of the West Yorkshire police authority, I understand that the increase announced by the Secretary of State will not allow new recruitment. Indeed, a letter sent from the Home Office to Members of Parliament representing constituencies in west Yorkshire states that no additional policemen will be provided for that area next year from the thousands of new officers who will be recruited. If the local police authority wishes to recruit trainees and constables, the clause could prevent it from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
doing so, because the local authority is a precepting authority. Authorities will be designated if they do not follow the guide lines set by the Secretary of State for the Environment. That is confusing for police authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office is responsible for the efficiency of the police force, but the Department of the Environment is responsible for setting levels of public expenditure. The sooner such confusion is resolved, the better for the people in the areas served by police authorities. The clause does not help and I appeal to Ministers to consider carefully the suggestion of the hon. Member for Bury, North that they review the formula on precepting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the precepts of the police authority and of the fire service within a metropolitan area are separate, there is no room for virement. In shire areas, where the county is responsible for fire, police, community and health services, the virement of available resources is possible. The formula goes against the metropolitan authorities, which must follow a stricter application of the money that can be raised. I want the Department to consider again the capping and precepting arrangements for metropolitan authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of community services is causing much anxiety in metropolitan authorities. The Government's attitude to the health authorities is creating problems for that provision. Local authorities must become responsible for people with AIDS, mentally ill people and physically disabled people who are discharged from health authority care into the community. The numbers of such people are growing, but, under the threat of being designated for capping purposes, authorities have to cut the services needed by the community when they come to make their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eastbourne received an increase in its standard spending assessment last year of 37 per cent. Yet the SSA increase for the authorities in the West Yorkshire area, which needs resources for community services, policing and fire fighting, was less than one third of the increase to Eastbourne. Why is that allowed? My own area of Wakefield and Leeds has great unemployment problems because of the closure of the mining, textile and engineering industries. The local authority wants to initiate job opportunities there, but because no development grants are applicable to the area, that task becomes much greater. Therefore, if local authorities must make provision for encouraging employment in their budgets, they are threatened by designation for capping and so are forced to cut back more than they would wish. If the provisions of chapter V go through in their present form, it will have a devastating and far-reaching effect on services in many areas. Our amendment should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the Minister say last night that parishes could precept, but only to the level of services provided generally in the district. If the parish precepts to provide those services, the district should reduce its precept so that the rate payers in the area do not pay extra for the same services. That principle is fine, but the Minister's approach is wrong.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is why we must have 	<i>Hansard.</i> The issue may be raised again when we have read the record of our previous sitting, or on Report. It is important that the future financing of local government is set correctly now. This is about the 60th local government Bill in the past 11 years, of which a
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
substantial number have been targeted at the control of finances. The future financing of parish councils is therefore significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's remarks raised a further point about precepting. In metropolitan areas, many places are not parished and cannot raise money. Will this or future Bills ensure that resources are made available to local authorities for services to those wards? There should be a uniformity of services throughout an area or there will be tremendous difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, the Minister referred mostly to shire district authorities. I ask him carefully to consider the parish councils and the larger town councils in metropolitan district authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) referred to parishes of 600 to 700, but in parishes of 30,000, the problems are greater. The town councils provide sports centres, swimming pools, carnivals and entertainment because they have the resources to do so. A ward which has no parish or town council must rely on the metropolitan district to provide the resources. These provisions mean that that ward cannot have the facilities that a town council can provide, so there will be discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the provisions are accepted, there will be differential ratings in metropolitan district areas. Differential ratings will mean a real administrative problem for the treasurers of local authorities in the metropolitan areas and the Minister should consult them. The Committee should consider the matter carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will have serious repercussions not only for local authorities but for the precepting authorities such as the police, the fire authorities and those responsible for drainage and waste disposal. The joint waste management authorities are precepting authorities on the district councils this year, although that may change under future local government legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities will be designated if they do not keep within the formula laid down by the Secretary of State. Therefore, the Minister should give amendment No. 302 his careful and favourable consideration. I support the amendment because it is relevant to metropolitan district areas as well as the London boroughs and shire areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have enjoyed a debate of more than three hours on this subject. For those of us who are concerned about the extension of European Commission competence into one area after another, it was rather alarming to find Mr. Delors making three appearances in our deliberations. Perhaps it would be more precise to say that he made the same appearance three times. I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) has begun to twitch or nod at that mention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) urged me to give favourable consideration to the amendment. He cannot have been serious, given that his hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) described it as a wrecking amendment when he spoke to it, although the hon. Member for Dagenham was slightly too modest in his description.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not hear the word "wrecking" used. Indeed, the amendment would not have been selected had it been a wrecking amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall study 	<i>Hansard,</i> but I remember the hon. Gentleman saying that. Of course, Sir Michael, you would not have selected it if you had thought that it was a wrecking amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Minister. It is true that I used the word "wrecking", but I proposed to wreck the whole business of capping. It was not an attempt to wreck, in a technical sense, the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any case, the hon. Member for Dagenham spoke with undue modesty. This is not merely a wrecking amendment—it gives force to the full panoply of the nonsense of the Labour party's position. Conservative Members remember how the hon. Member for Dagenham was given the runaround over the use of the expression "in extremis". His explanation was that in extremis, as it turned out, meant that there might be some powers over authorities that were behaving fraudulently or ultra vires. And hey presto, what would the amendment do? It would limit the capping circumstances to those in which an authority had set an unlawful budget which did not comply with statutory requirements. So this wrecking amendment is designed to give force to the nonsense of the Labour party's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party demonstrated that not only has it been out of office for the past 12 years, but it has been in hibernation. It has seen, heard and learnt nothing over the past 12 years. It is all very well for Opposition Members to peddle their splendid stuff about local accountability and the voter having the final say, but it was the Conservative party that sincerely tried to make that happen. It was the Conservative party that introduced a system of taxation to make accountability transparent and evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party has suffered the disappointment of that local accountability not working in all places. We have learnt from that and yes, we have changed our point of view. Otherwise we would not be introducing the Bill which, in clause 100, will abolish the community charge. I would rather stand here and say that we have learnt something and moved our position than pretend, like the Opposition that none of the events of the past 12 years have occurred. That is a wholly indefensible position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister care to go one step further and, for the first time, say not just that the Government have learnt from the poll tax, but that the poll tax was wrong from the beginning and was a mistake, and that they are sorry that they introduced it? Will the Minister take the opportunity to say sorry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only ever been sorry that we were unable to bring to bear on all the overspending Labour authorities the sort of pressure exerted by the electorate in Ealing, Hillingdon, Brent, Trafford, Southend and the other places where we scored great electoral success, not to mention those places where we were already in power and increased our vote, such as Wandsworth and Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now having great difficulty understanding why the hon. Gentleman has remained a Minister in the Government. He obviously believes that the poll tax should not be replaced, but he is arguing for its abolition. Today, we shall discuss a clause that is headed "Abolition of community charges". Why does the Minister not stand by his principles and get out of the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we do not go too far down that line. We have already had a discussion once, if not twice, on that very subject. Perhaps we could pursue the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The community charge is in place and the Opposition have been at some pains to make that point. The Bill will replace the community charge with the council tax. My position on that is clear. I supported the Community charge and I support its replacement with the Council tax. There is nothing peculiar about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition recited some quotations, going back to the early 1980s, from people, some with Conservative views, who were against the idea of capping. However, people learn by experience over a period of time. I would not be surprised to learn that the views of Roy Thomason, who will be the next Member of Parliament for Bromsgrove, have matured, and we shall test them when he arrives here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made his position plain. He changed his position because of the decision by the Government to reduce the community charge by £140 on the headline figure. He saw with immense clarity—his point should carry force with the Opposition because they know that my right hon. Friend had taken a strong personal position—that once the community charge had been reduced by that amount, we had to make sure that that money was going to go into people's pockets rather than into the town hall. The strength of that argument convinced my right hon. Friend that capping was appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister put his point succinctly? Is he saying that the principles enunciated in 	<i>The Times</i> on 5 May 1990 by the Secretary of State were overturned, not by 30 pieces of silver, but by £4·3 billion of expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said what I wanted to say. My right hon. Friend's view was transformed, rightly, by the substantial switch from local taxation to taxes raised by central Government that would then be used to finance local government. We were determined that that money should be used to benefit the community charge payer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister adhere, in the cold light of day, to the view that he expressed last night, which, I imagine, is recorded in 	<i>Hansard,</i> that, on this issue, the Secretary of State is to be regarded as a sinner who has repented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last night, I put succinctly and humourously what I have now had an opportunity to explain at length; the same explanation that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment offered on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a lot about SSAs during the course of the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Alistair Burt) joined in that debate and several hon. Members on both sides of the Committee expressed their views. Every now and again, one is tempted by the vision of a Labour Government—it does not happen often. The Opposition spokesmen pile up their denunciations of capping and spending controls and of SSAs. One is tempted to wonder, if they were in government, what they would do when faced with the problem of distributing billions of pounds in grants to local authorities and trying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
to do it on an equitable basis. If the SSA for each local authority were the same, there would be no point to the grant mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the grant mechanism is to give different amounts to different local authorities in recognition of their different needs. If grants are not distributed on the basis of measurement and by trying to discover objective criteria and the features that make it more expensive to provide local authority services in one place than in another, on what basis should it be done? According to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti), it should be done on the basis of his intuition. He would override the piles of statistics and evidence that show what it costs to provide services in different local authorities. The hon. Gentleman cannot understand why it should cost more to do something in Hove than in Brighton or Eastbourne. I tremble at the thought of government conducted on the basis of his intuition. That is an alarming prospect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why, for two consecutive years, following SSA calculations in Hove borough, which is adjoined in an urban area to Brighton, no rate was levied for its council services and, yet, in neighbouring Brighton, a very high rate was levied? The councils have changed hands so that cannot be explained in terms of politics. Can the Minister explain that? Does not he think that he should take SSAs back to the drawing board and start again on a blank piece of paper? The Government cannot keep adding to the old system. At some stage, the whole thing must be reviewed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two considerations. First, what do the local authorities need to spend? The Government will have considered the social characteristics of the two places, as part of the assessment of their other spending block needs, and will have made a calculation on that basis. The second consideration, to which the hon. Gentleman alluded in his speech—he knows the answer perfectly well—is that some boroughs have accumulated wealth. The hon. Gentleman would like to penalise boroughs which have accumulated wealth. In the interests of some Liberal view of equality, he wants to cast aside the money that has been taken from ratepayers or the money that has been realised by selling assets. He can go and sell that to the people of Hove or anywhere else, but I cannot imagine why people should be deprived of what they and their mothers and fathers put by in times gone by. If there is an accumulated mass of wealth in a local authority, it belongs to that community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the word "need". Does he agree that the root of our troubles over the past 10 or 12 years stems from the fact that how much a local authority spent used to represent its needs? That is how we got into that mess. Opposition Members have never got out of the habit of relating spending to needs. Whenever they use the word "need" they actually mean what they would like to spend. The two are not the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In that respect the Lib-Lab pact is fully intact. The hon. Member for Eastbourne believes that an authority that wishes to spend more should be given more. The hon. Member for Dagenham, in a debate last night about receipts from reserves and balances, also maintained that authorities with less income from reserves and balances should be rewarded with more money, while those with more income from such sources should be given less money. In other words, the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
Dagenham wants to set up a system in which money is given to the least prudent, and taken away from the most prudent. The hon. Gentleman said at one point that that was not his position, but as usual we did not hear what his position really is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we heard in the Minister's reply to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) what sounded like a touching and heartfelt affirmation of the principle that rate payers or local government tax payers have an inalienable right to assets built up or realised by their local authority, which often take the form of capital receipts. That sounds attractive, but if they believe in that principle so strongly, why do the Government prevent local authorities from spending those receipts as they choose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that local authorities have rights of property, as do individuals. The Labour party is not strong on recognising those rights. I have no wish to deprive local authorities of the receipts derived from selling their assets. However, the Government have a right to restrict the ways in which that money is spent. Heavily indebted authorities should repay some of their debts as they dispose of their assets. That is crucial to the question of public expenditure. The hon. Member for Dagenham may not recognise it, but the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) certainly does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked yesterday about the differences between the ways in which sales of assets are handled in Scotland and in England. All I heard by way of response was a repeat of a smart-aleck remark by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman), who is not in the Room at the moment. Perhaps the Minister will give me a reply now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I began to describe everything that is done differently in Scotland, I should be here for a long time. There are different Secretaries of State, different arrangements, local government has a different shape and receives grants that differ in size and sometimes in nature. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and his colleagues decide how matters should be handled in Scotland. I answer for the way in which they are handled in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why, in that case, does the Minister always imply that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham and I differ over Scottish matters? Moreover, if there are such differences in practice between England and Scotland, why must we debate the clauses that relate to Scotland and England together, when we should have had a separate Bill for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the general point that I made, many features of the Bill are common to both Scotland and England and use exactly the same form of words. I am pleased that the Committee has been able to discuss some Scottish matters in our debates on clauses relating to England. I am only sorry that the Opposition have allocated time in such a way as to restrict the amount of time we have been able to devote to Scottish matters. Even so, I am pleased that we have been able to discuss Scottish matters as thoroughly as we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Will you make it clear to the Committee that the allocation of time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
has been decided entirely according to a timetable approved by Conservative Members on the Floor of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could go into a long discussion on the allocation of time, but that is not a matter for me. Let us proceed with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before we leave the subject of standard spending assessments I should like to warn the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that he is in danger of being naive if he believes that the Department of the Environment has sole responsibility for deciding the allocation of money to police authorities. Does it not occur to him that the allocation of more than £30 billion of central Government finance requires collective decisions? My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, who decides the establishments of the police forces, is intimately involved in decisions about the total amount available under total standard spending and about how that money should be split between the different services. I am sure that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) will want to discuss with the police authorities the enormous increases in standard spending assessment proposed for the coming year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last year, the Home Secretary set the level of staffing requirements for the West Yorkshire police. To meet that requirement would mean that the West Yorkshire police will be in excess of the SSA. How does the Minister reconcile the fact that the Home Secretary said that the West Yorkshire police need so many constables and so on in the force with the fact that the Secretary of State for the Environment says that they can have only so much money? If, as the Minister said, there is a rapport between the two requirements, what went wrong? The Home Office said that there will be no additional constable recruitment in West Yorkshire this year. The increase in revenue is not, therefore, for that purpose but to take up what was arranged last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts himself in the position of believing whatever he is told by a local authority, a local authority association or a chief constable. He seems to believe that there is no scope for efficiency, or for doing things better. The moneys made available to the police forces are sufficient for the police to do their job, to maintain their establishment and to help some police authorities to do their job at full establishment. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary wants to carry out efficiency inspections to discover where the money goes and how it may best be deployed to ensure that establishments are maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to collectiveness in the allocation of police officers and to how centralist controls can go against decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area where I have served on the council for nearly 11 years falls within the Sussex police authority. It is outrageous to suggest that we do not listen to the views of the chief constable. The record will show that the Minister suggested to Opposition Members that we did not listen to our chief constables. The reason why the Minister may want—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why the Minister does not want us to listen to the chief constables may be that the generous and enormous additions announced under the collectiveness policy are not as generous and enormous as the Minister claims. They are, in fact, very small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have been deeply shocked by the misrepresentation of what I have just said had I not heard the speech of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, which was a misrepresentation of what I said last night from beginning to end. That seems to be his stock in politics. Fortunately, our words are recorded in the 	<i>Official Report</i> and that gives us some protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's reasons for capping are twofold, as I explained before. It is to defend the public expenditure position—what local authorities spend is part of general Government expenditure—and to defend the community charge payer and, in future, the council tax payer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past two years there has been a 21 per cent, increase in local authority spending in England. There was an 11 per cent, increase in 1989–90 and a 9 per cent, increase in 1990–91. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) made the point strongly that there has been an enormous increase in local authority spending. The Government are bound to step in to help the community charge payer and, in future, the council tax payer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a debate about why the proposal had been extended to those authorities that spend less than £15 million. It is partly because those authorities, in aggregate, spend £1·95 billion. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is fond of saying, "A billion here, a billion there and you are soon talking about serious money." That is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, capping resulted in bills being reduced. The reduction per community charge payer in Basildon was £39, in Bristol £15, in Lambeth £25 and in Wirral £32. Those are significant reductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Basildon it works out at about 80p a week. If the Government announced that we would reduce pensions or benefits by 80p a week or increase prescription charges by 80p, the Labour party would be outraged, but it is happy to allow Labour authorities to impose enormous bills on pensioners, low income earners and vulnerable people. They shed not so much as a crocodile tear about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Opposition's presentation, I was struggling to understand the Labour party's claim that it would not control local authority expenditure after all that it has seen over the past 12 years. We must remember that when the Labour party was last in office, it introduced sanctions and controls on wages, foreign exchange and prices. This is the party of blacklist and sanctions, and it cut capital spending on hospitals and on roads. But, uniquely, the Labour party says that it will not control local authority spending—or will it? In a frank moment late in the night, the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) talked about sending out circulars with directions and began to lift the veil over Labour party proposals. He spoke about a two-way process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably local authorities will also send directions to central Government, or perhaps they will simply come from the National and Local Government Officers Association, the National Union of Public Employees and the Confederation of Health Service Employees. The Labour party claims that it will not control local authority

	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
spending but, even in Opposition, it has suspended councillors in Lambeth. If it does that in Opposition, what on earth will it do in Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has had some influence in calming the Labour party's aspirations to increase public spending. She is now tipped to be Chief Whip in a Labour Government. I presume that she is too much of a threat to the hon. Members for Dagenham, for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and to all the others who make extravagant promises about spending. She has been moved on to the Back Benches so that the others can continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North spoke with passion about Albert Little who has every reason to know what Labour Government in practice means to the control of local government spending. Let me take up what my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) said. Let us take the Labour party at its word and tell the people of this country that a Labour Government will offer no protection against excessive spending. The sky will be the limit. Nothing will be done to protect people's bills and any levy will be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leyton referred to partnership. We remember all those bodies and private companies that were forced to do deals with the Government under pain of blacklist and sanction. The key figure of the previous Labour Government was Mr. Solomon Binding. Under any new Labour Government, Mr. Roland Revaluation will stalk the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the comments made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne and the deplorable misrepresentation of what had been said the evening before. I am not tempted to go further on the question of parishes and the circumstances under which they would be capped because, first, I said a lot on the subject last night and I have not yet had the opportunity to read it in 	<i>Hansard.</i> As the hon. Member for Norman ton did not understand my argument, he might benefit from reading the record. Secondly, I am aware that you have been very indulgent, Sir Michael, as the question whether parishes can be included in the district budget for capping purposes is covered by clause 54. It may be better to deal with it there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few years we have amply demonstrated why the Government should have capping powers and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North would wish, we looked carefully, year by year, at standard spending assessments, considered the evidence presented to us and made what improvements we could. Standard spending assessments must be as good as they possibly can be, particularly if capping comes in at levels close to the SSA. We have not only demonstrated why the powers are appropriate but have unveiled the absolute bankruptcy of the Labour party's position, its failure to learn anything over the years, the improbability of its policy and the extraordinary threat that it poses to everyone who is grateful that the community charge has been reduced but who fear that, under a Labour Government, the council tax could be allowed to soar in the future, as the rates under Labour soared in the past. People are fearful about a party that has no idea of how rapidly the burden on local tax payers could rise, were it not for the powers that Conservative Governments have taken in the past and that we propose again in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me immediately assure the Minister and the public that there is no prospect of council tax bills soaring under a Labour Government, as we would not tolerate for a moment the absolute chaos and confusion that is implicit in the Government's council tax proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State has often revealed himself to be a man of elastic principles. There were some classic instances of that in what he has just said. Without a blush or any apparent sign of embarrassment he said in the same sentence that he was both a supporter of the poll tax and a supporter of the measure to abolish it and to replace it with the council tax. The fact that he can at the same time embrace such diametrically opposite positions gives us the measure of the man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the hon. Gentleman has some pressing reason—we have debated the matter long enough, given the pressure of the guillotine on other debates—it is not a good idea to prolong contributions at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not resile—that was the word used by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) this morning—for a moment from his famous assertion to the Tory party conference that the poll tax was a vote winner. Indeed, he cited instances to prove that it was. That leaves open the question as to why he is now so anxious to abandon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then heard the Minister's enunciation of the general principle that there was a fundamental difference between the measures proposed for Scotland and for England, but as soon as he was challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) he redefined the general principle and said that there were major exceptions that explained his current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on, Sir Michael. The hon. Gentleman then gave us his stirring enunciation of the principle that ratepayers should be able to control not only their own capital receipts but those accumulated by their parents and grandparents, although he could not explain why, in that case, the Government insisted that local authorities had virtually no control over their own capital receipts and that their disposition by way of repayment of debt was entirely dictated by central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had several classic examples, with which we have become all too wearyingly familiar, of the Minister's slipperiness on some of these questions. As a consequence, the tired old arguments, which he and his ministerial predecessors have deployed to explain their progressive steps from hostility to capping as a whole to support for universal capping, fail to carry conviction. The best evidence of that is the outrage and hostility that they have created among those at whom the arguments are directed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government, local government associations and even the majority of leading Conservative figures in local government have not been convinced by the Minister's arguments today. Moreover, not just local government practitioners, but all independent, expert bodies and journals on local government and major organs of opinion are not convinced. We were able to quote from 	<i>The Times</i> leader about how the capping proposals constitute a shocking intrusion into local government democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's lack of principle on these matters is likely to infect his hon. Friends. The Minister gave a graphic illustration of that when he dismissed the opposition of Mr. Roy Thomason to capping. He was confident, and cynical, in forecasting that if Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
Thomason were to join the Conservative parliamentary party, his principled opposition would melt away, just as the principled opposition of so many others had melted away. We were able to discuss, with common enjoyment, the sad case of the Secretary of State who had resolutely adhered to a principled position for over a decade, but had then been brow beaten and bought off and was now welcomed by the Minister as a sinner who had repented. That is a sad case of a man who had stuck to his principles for so long, but had then abandoned them, even at this late stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have no interest in or understanding of local government democracy. They are concerned on this issue, as with so many others, to do only what they can to save their electoral skin. That is at the bottom of the measure; that is why we oppose it and why we shall take the opportunity to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might appear strange that a Welsh Member should move an amendment which deals with the common council of the Corporation of the City of London. Yesterday we debated the extension of capping powers to local authorities whose budget was less than £15 million which will mean that all the Welsh district councils, with one or two exceptions, will be brought into the capping net. I was outraged that all those local authorities in the Principality as well as the others in Britain—all of which were democratically elected—should be put into that net when the Corporation of the City of London, which was unreformed even under the municipal reform provisions of the Statutory Declarations Act 1835, is not included. When we consider that the local Government Finance Act 1988—the poll tax legislation—and this Bill both provide that the Secretary of State must adopt a common set of principles when deciding the basis on which an authority may be designated, and that the City of London is a billing authority for the purposes of this tax and a charging authority for the purposes of the poll tax, it is quite wrong that the City of London should be exempted from these draconian provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
The Government have extended capping to all authorities. They have even taken the power to include the expenditure on parish precepts, which we shall discuss later. But in the Government's calculations, the City of London still remains outside the capping criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990–91, the City of London was 62·2 per cent, and £10,089 per head above its standard spending assessment, but it was not designated. When the provisional criteria for 1991–92 were announced in October, 	<i>Municipal Journal</i> said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"11 district councils and the City of London will have to cut their budgets and make no allowance for inflation if they are to avoid community charge capping next year."</p></blockquote>
It is bad enough that this anachronistic organisation still exists for democratic purposes. It is the policy of the Labour party to retain the corporation for ceremonial purposes, but its local government functions will be performed in proper democratic fashion as in the other boroughs of the great city of London and the area which was previously covered by the Greater London council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rich to say that all Welsh district authorities could be capped by the Government while the Corporation of the City of London, anachronistic as it is, should be untouched.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Sir Michael. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) that it is outrageous that the City of London should be excluded from the capping criteria when virtually every other authority is included and even parish councils are affected. That shows the power of the City of London. I understand that it has not presented a Bill to this House that has not been passed in the past 150 to 200 years. That is an amazing record. The fact that the Corporation of the City of London can turn out 100 or 200 Conservative Members to get those Bills through shows its wealth and influence. It exerted its power in this case and excluded itself from the capping criteria. There is no check on its spending or financial powers. My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen is right to say that it is an anachronism. It is certainly undemocratic. There is no proper electoral process for Londoners as a whole. It retains and proudly boasts that it retains the business voter. However, it certainly does not represent London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1987, the then Secretary of State the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), was asked about the treatment of the Corporation of London under the poll tax and the non-domestic rate. He said that the City of London was unique among local authorities in that it had a very small resident population combined with a need to provide services for a large, daytime inflow of commuters. He also said that it was unique in that it contained a business vote and that was why it received special privileges under the poll tax. But it is not the only authority that has to cope with a large daytime inflow of commuters. Many other London authorities do and yet they do not have the capping criteria lifted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990–91, the City of London spent 62·2 per cent, above its standard spending assessment. It spent £10,089 per head over its SSA, but it was not designated for capping. What other authority in that situation would not be capped? The City would fall under any overspending criteria used by the Government with that level of expenditure. It is wrong that it is not capped. The City of London has huge wealth. Recently, a European bank
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
wanted to set up in London and it was given £250,000 to refurbish offices. That was an easy handout because the City of London makes an enormous amount of money from rent on offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the Government have not extended privatisation to the City of London so that they could sell off those profitable offices. Instead, the City is allowed to keep the offices and the wealth that flows from them in one of the most profitable parts of London. That huge rental income should be distributed to the rest of London. I see a note being passed and I am sure that it will say that the City of London contributes to the pool, but it does not contribute enough and its spending is uncontrolled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary may say nonsense, but the facts show that the City has been allowed to operate virtually unchecked. It has obtained enormous wealth from rents, which is not the case in the rest of London. There should be criteria to include the City in the financial regime that the Government want to set up for every other local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to say that I am a strong supporter of the City of London, and that Opposition Members are wrong. I shall put them out of their misery as quickly as possible. I do not find it strange that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) tabled the amendment—this is a united kingdom. However, the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) is wrong, vindictive, destructive, envious and—worst of all—he seems to have been asleep for a fortnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in favour of the City of London as a matter of general policy. The hon. Member for Leyton said that the Labour party wished to abolish its local government powers. That would be a grave mistake, and would do nothing to enhance the City of London or the reputation of the country. I greatly regret such an approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the financial regime of the City is very special. It has few residents and, therefore, a very small domestic tax base under both the community charge and the council tax. However, as it is a major centre of employment, its functions, which include policing, are those of a major authority. Its domestic tax resources are small and disproportionate to the services provided. Therefore, the City is allowed to retain some of its very large non-domestic rate resources. The national non-domestic rate poundage is set lower in the City than
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
elsewhere—it is 36·9p instead of 38·6p. The City charges an additional local amount to fund its expenditure. In 1991–92 that amount is set at l·7p, which brings the total non-domestic rate in the City to the level that applies elsewhere. The City is therefore able to fund an appropriate level of spending without charging domestic taxpayers more than they would have to pay elsewhere. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 10 will make technical improvements to those special arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City of London is also unique because of the vast inflow of people. It has about 5,500 residents, but hundreds of thousands of commuters flow in and out each weekday. I hope that the hon. Member for Leyton will take careful note of the fact that we have recently announced provisional capping criteria for 1992–93, including criteria for the City of London. On 26 November details of those criteria were sent to the clerk of the City. The City of London is not exempt from those criteria—I make that clear, and it should be widely known. That is why the amendment is at fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment purports to bring the City of London within the capping regime, it is a signal failure, as all billing authorities, including the common council of the City of London, are already included within the capping regime by virtue of clause 53(1), which defines references to an authority in the Bill for the purposes of capping as billing authorities and major precepting authorities. There is no question of exempting from capping the common council or any other authority, except the receiver of the Metropolitan police district, to which special considerations apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the City could be subject to capping. Will the Minister spell out the criteria? He said that the City of London was unique. Thousands of people come in and out of other parts of central London, so it is not unique in that respect. However, it is unique in that it has enormous wealth and can spend virtually what it likes without feeling the burden. Where are the criteria not in the Bill, so that we can tackle that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The criteria that the Secretary of State decides to impose are announced each year, in advance. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the common council of the City of London is not in a different position from his own authority or any other, in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to wealth, the only respect in which the City differs is that, uniquely its SSA does not represent our view of the appropriate level of expenditure to enable the authority to provide a standard level of service. For the purpose of comparison the Secretary of State adds to the City of London's SSA the amount of expenditure that he agrees should be financed, under the special arrangements, to reflect the low number of charge payers and, in future, council tax payers, as I have already explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) will withdraw the amendment now that I have cleared up the misunderstanding and pointed out that the City of London comes under the capping criteria for next year, for the community charge, and that it comes under the criteria for the year after next, for the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said is useful because it is now on record that the common council of the City of London will be subject to the same capping criteria as other local authorities. It has been useful also for the Committee to discuss some of the aspects of the financial

	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
arrangements which effect the City of London. I am sure that members of the Committee will not be bothered about the Lord Mayor, the Guildhall and the other ceremonial aspects of the City. All that can remain, but it is very bad for other local authorities to have to suffer the rules and regulations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend induce the Minister to elaborate on one small point that he made? Although capping criteria will apply to the City of London, the criteria will differ from those applied to other authorities. Will the Minister tell the Committee which other authorities fall within the same category as the City of London for capping purposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister could be persuaded to answer those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be delighted to do so. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) caught me commenting on what the hon. Member for Torfaen said. The hon. Member for Torfaen implied that all authorities were subject to the same capping criteria. My point was that authorities fall within different sections of the capping criteria, as announced by the Secretary of State. I am sure that it was not the hon. Gentleman's intention to suggest that there was only one cap that would fit every authority. Different criteria apply, depending on the degree of overspending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and there are different criteria for Wales and England. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton made a valid point. The Bill should refer, somewhere, to the common council of the City of London. As it is, the Bill gives the distinct impression that the City of London is exempt from capping. I take the point that the Minister made when he said that that was not the case. The point about the City of London will be dealt with elsewhere. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
