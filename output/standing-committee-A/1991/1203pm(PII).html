<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p>[Continuation from column 748]</p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just concluding my speech when my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) sought to intervene. Does he still wish to speak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To use rugby parlance, my hon. Friend has given me a hospital pass. In addition to the two options that the Government have under the Bill, I was saying that there is a third option. The external auditors could assess the position and set what they believed was an appropriate level of balances for each authority in the same way in which they currently recommend whether the balances held are financially prudent. If such an approach were taken, the Government's objectives would still be achieved. Furthermore, when authorities had prudent balances, such balances would not be used for capping purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. There is no need for me to extend my speech. Clearly, only expenditure that was planned for a specific year should count for the purposes of capping. There is no need for the balances element. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans<span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 232 and to add my support for the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). I have asked the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) several questions but, as usual, he has not replied to one of them. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is not in Committee at the moment, as I would have given him the opportunity to respond to some of the issues that I raised.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that the present difficulties were due to the problems with the community charge. The number of people who have not paid that tax has been transparent for all to see. That did not happen under the rating system. Had we had a system under the rates by which people could know who did not pay, they, too, would have been annoyed and an amendment similar to amendment No. 232 might have been tabled many years ago. Under the poll tax, people could see for the first time that a considerable number of people did not pay the charge. I was especially interested in the ability of the hon. Member for Dagenham to adopt one approach south of the border and another approach for circumstances north of the border.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain that remark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are suggesting that the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, or a similar proposal, should be allowed north of the border, but not south of the border.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that under amendment No. 303 which is tabled by the Opposition, non-collection of the community charge could not be passed on to council tax payers in Scotland. Thus, the consequences of the non-collection would mean a reduction of services in Scottish local authorities. Is my hon. Friend aware that I intend to accept the Opposition's amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend, who put it much more eloquently than I could have done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has just told me that that is the Lord Advocate's advice. I gather that we are entitled to have the Lord Advocate present to explain his interpretation of my amendment.<br><br>
I say to the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) that while I accept, in strict terms, that the Minister's interpretation may be right, I believe that the affect of my amendment would be that the bill for poll tax arrears was picked up by general taxpayers, through Government grant, not by council tax payers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but I would rather accept the view of the Law Officer of Scotland than the hon. Gentleman's view of how the amendment would apply in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember the Lord Advocate when he was a Member of Parliament, and I would rather take my own advice than his.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on that remark.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham mentioned the so-called subsidy that he suggested central Government should provide to local government to publicise those who were not paying their poll tax so that it would be easier to collect the full amount—from poll tax payers in a particular borough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be doing his best, but he has completely misrepresented what I said. It had nothing to do with publicising the names of non-payers. It was a request from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, which the Association of District Councils supported, for a Government-financed advertising campaign urging people to pay their poll tax and alerting them to the fact that they were still obliged to do so. I do not know how the hon. Gentleman has come to wander off into his little cul-de-sac.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had allowed me to continue, he would have understood what I was getting at. He suggested a Government-financed advertising campaign to encourage people to pay their poll tax, but earlier in the Committee he and his hon. Friends said that Brent council's efforts to do that from its own resources were not to be recommended. The hon. Members for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) and for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) said that Brent council should not be encouraged to advertise the fact that certain people had not paid their poll tax. There is clearly a difference of opinion among Opposition Members about the desirability of advertising.<br><br>
The amendment is a good one and, white I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding that it may contain technical errors, as a principle I see no reason why people who have paid their contribution to local services should have to contribute to services for those who have not.<br><br>

Earlier, I mentioned Liverpool, where the most incredible situation has arisen. There is a larger backlog of uncollected rates than of poll tax and one individual had not paid rates or poll tax since 1983. That shows clearly the sort of thing that happens only in Labour boroughs. Eventually, as the result of a long debate in the council chamber, instigated by Liberal and Conservative members, it was agreed to set up a sub-committee to find out who had paid neither poll tax nor rates. It discovered that one person had not paid since 1983 and owed £9,000 of arrears. When approached about the matter he said, "I have never been asked to pay, but it is all in the bank", and handed over a cheque forthwith. That sums up the purpose of the amendment. Why should a poll tax payer have to pay for the incompetence of a local authority such as Liverpool?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How typical is that example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am merely giving an example of what has happened in the past, and I am certain that many hon. Members with constituencies in London will know of similar cases of long-term non-collection of rates and poll tax. The issue has been raised recently only because the poll tax has made it transparently obvious that some people have not paid. I support amendment No. 232 and hope that, when the Minister replies, he will examine closely the principle in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a long and interesting debate which has been graced by four speeches from the Opposition Front Bench. The interventions of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) were sufficiently weighty to constitute a speech in themselves. I shall divide my speech into two, and deal first with the Opposition amendments and, secondly, if he will forgive me, with the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies).<br><br>
On the Opposition amendments, I shall make a point that is obvious but needs repeating. No local authority will be capped, or risk being capped, if it spends at or below its standard spending assessment. Therefore, the whole of the Opposition's argument has been about local authorities that spend above their SSAs, find themselves in the frame for capping, and have to deal with the consequent problems. It is important to establish that the debate is about authorities that spend above their SSAs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister would agree that his predecessor as Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities—one of the many who have been promoted from that position: is now Secretary of State for Defence— <i>[Interruption.]</i> Bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Please use a tissue—that should go in <i>Hansard.</i> It is an obsession of mine.<br><br>
On 1 April 1980 when the grant-related expenditure assessment procedures—the forerunner to standard spending assessment—were introduced, his predecessor was absolutely clear that the system was never intended to judge local council spending but only to establish how central Government grant should be distributed. That foundation has now been completely undermined and the SSAs are being used as a method of judging whether councils should be capped.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger that <i>Hansard</i> might suggest that I had sneezed without using a tissue; I should like to make it clear that that was not the case.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman sometimes accuses us of delving into history. He objects especially loudly when the quote of the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock) from 1980 is used, but he seems to have no compunction about using a quote from 1980. I remind him that the local government finance system was overhauled in 1988, but I am happy to assure him that capping deals with spending above standard spending assessments.<br><br>
Capping has two purposes which the Opposition seek to confuse. First, it plays an important part in the control of public expenditure. Local authority spending is part of general government expenditure. Secondly, it provides protection for community charge payers under the present system and will provide protection for council taxpayers under the new system.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
The council tax payer—the community charge payer of today—is not overly concerned about why his bill is rising excessively. He is not concerned about whether the aim is to put money into reserves. He is simply upset if an authority that is already spending at or above its SSA increases his bill excessively, for whatever reason. I wish to rest firmly on the second leg of the purpose of capping—the protection of the council tax payer in future—in answer to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled. I remember all the debates on the community charge. The reason that was constantly used for introducing it was that everyone should pay something to create accountability in local government and that, when people came to vote, they would understand what they had to pay for local government taxes and would vote accordingly. That was the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth<span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) is nodding his agreement. Therefore, I do not understand the Minister's argument about keeping capping down to protect the taxpayers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) is a Parliamentary Private Secretary in my Department and simply had a twitch during the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that was a twitch, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman visits his GP tomorrow morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He may have to go even further than that. <i>[Laughter.]</i><br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right. I wish that the community charge had produced the result that we wanted, and that all local authorities were held to account. Unfortunately, during its brief life, local authorities were able to lead people astray and make them think that the community charge that was set locally, depended more on Government grants than on local authority decisions. I regret that, but we have learnt from experience.<br><br>
Recently there have been two more good reasons to use capping to protect community charge payers. First, a reduction was made by taking £140 off the headline figure. It is important that that money should go back in the pocket of the council taxpayer and that it should not be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0437">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
frittered away in town halls. Secondly, when the community charge was introduced and there was the hustle and bustle of the change of system, many local authorities used the confusion to push up spending and blamed it on the change of system. We are keen that that should not be repeated in the change from the community charge to the council tax.<br><br>
The proper use of the drawing down of balances in any year is the smoothing of the budget from one year to another. If a local authority is aware that it faces expenses in one year which are not part of its continuing need to spend, it draws on its balances. If, in another year, it finds that it does not have those exceptional expenses, and, indeed, that a couple of factors operate in its favour in that year, it will use the opportunity to rebuild its balances. Almost by definition, balances exist to be used to meet exceptional expenditure and they are to be built up in years when there are no exceptional demands. That is the proper use of balances.<br><br>
We must bear in mind that money that is drawn from balances comes from a pool which has been paid for at some time by local taxpayers. Revenue from rates and community charges will be paid for by council tax payers in future. That money does not come from nowhere and, equally, when money is being put into balances it has to be raised from local taxpayers. As I said, the reasoning behind a charge levied on a local taxpayer is of little concern to him. He merely wants to be sure that he is not being charged an excessive amount by his local authority and does not want excessive year-to-year increases. Our view, for which there is widespread support, is that we should protect local taxpayers against those increases from year to year.<br><br>
A series of rather extraordinary possibilities was trotted out of local authorities that might have exceptional needs to draw on their balances. Some were in the category where special help would be available to local authorities, and some of my hon. Friends dealt effectively with those points. If extraordinary, exceptional expenditure is not covered by a special arrangement with the Government, there is always the possibility that a local authority designated for capping can appeal to Ministers for that cap to be varied.<br><br>
If such authorities come to see me, there is a reasonable chance that it will be varied, but if they see my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, they will have no chance at all. That is merely the experience of last year and there is no significance in that comment. Ministers are bound to deal reasonably with all representations that are made to them. If a representation to vary the cap is made to either my hon. Friend or me, we shall consider it seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall the representations that were made by more than one group of people last year about the cap on the west Yorkshire police authority. Even the chief constable said that the level of expenditure was insufficient to meet the demand on police services. However, there was no revision of the cap. So if there was a better case for the west Yorkshire police, perhaps the Minister will explain what it was. If there was no better case, perhaps he will explain why the cap was not varied in view of last week's decision of the Secretary of State to increase expenditure on that police force to meet the shortfall caused by capping in the previous year.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
Will the Minister comment on those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The better cases were from Warwickshire, Wirral, Ipswich and Bristol. I speak from memory but I believe that the cap was varied in those cases, although I may not be exactly right.<br><br>
It was a matter for ministerial judgment, and I am not prepared to go into the factors that lay behind it. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we seriously considered every representation that was made to us before we gave our view.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) referred to city challenge. To meet the administrative costs to winning authorities of setting up city challenge this year, grant is available via the urban programme mechanism and is largely funded by the city action teams. Next year and in subsequent years, there will also be grants, which will be included in the city challenge envelope. The package put together by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment is very good. City challenge authorities will in future have the financing costs of any special credit approvals included in their standard spending assessments. They will receive grant to cover the management costs of their project and they will receive 90 per cent, funding for revenue urban programme projects, rather than the usual 75 per cent. Those announcements were well received when my right hon. and hon. Friends made them at the recent conference in Newcastle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all pleased that 90 per cent., rather than 75 per cent., is to be paid to those authorities fortunate enough to win the city challenge. Will the Minister concede, however, that it will be a burden for them to find 10 per cent, of a larger sum, especially as they are acknowledged to be hard-pressed authorities? It is likely that, after 13 years of Conservative regimes, they will have to cut some other service to fund their contribution, if they are to be subject to the capping rules announced last week.<br><br>
Will the Minister also confirm that the Under-Secretary, to whom he paid tribute, will write to me soon to explain how the speech at the fringe meeting of the Church of England Synod, as reported in the newspapers, squares with the written answer that he gave me about the fact that authorities will lose out in other areas in order to contribute to the city challenge scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Doubtless my hon. Friend will have heard what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
The authorities are not anxious to look a gift horse in the mouth. It is true that they are asked to provide 10 per cent, of the urban programme revenue grant funding. However, much of that money that they receive is not in the form of urban programme revenue grant funding; a considerable amount is in the form of city grant paid to private developers in their area. With approximately £35 million to £37-5 million coming the way of those authorities over a five-year period, and with only a small portion of that being financed locally, local authorities can work out the arithmetic and see that they are advantaged.<br><br>
I want to correct what I said a moment ago. When I said that the four cases were Warwickshire, Wirral, Bristol and Ipswich, I meant Lambeth—not Ipswich. How I could have forgotten Lambeth, I cannot imagine.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) may remember that the west Yorkshire police authority was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0438">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 755</span>
not, in the end, designated for capping. It set a budget that was beneath the capping limit. I hope that that helps to put the record straight.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) rehearsed a number of points that he had made earlier about standing spending assessments. That discussion will be continued outside the Committee and in other ways. I emphasise to him that we are not dictating the level of balances that local authorities should hold; we are only influencing the level of their budgets. To return to my point, if an authority is drawing down on its balances in a particular year, it is, in effect, disguising for the time being a level of spending which is higher than that reflected in its budget, because it is using balances that at some time in the past have been raised from local taxpayers.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) was worried about the way in which we assess the interest available to local authorities on their balances. I had some sympathy with what she said. She will have noted, no doubt, that our aim in SSAs is to measure the capacity of an authority to generate interest receipts on its balances. So, for the coming year, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced last week, we propose a split between counties and districts in the interest receipts that they can be expected to generate. That will take into account the fact that counties are less able than districts to generate receipts, partly because they do not have the opportunity to hold the collection fund and partly because they do not have housing stock to sell off.<br><br>
10 pm<br><br>
That is a good example of the way in which the Government have responded to representations about the standard spending assessments. In light of the new evidence that has been presented, we have been willing to go along with changes that have been proposed by the local authority associations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that at the heart of the problem is the Government's persistence in seeking to exploit the use and misuse of balances in local authorities? By far the best option would be to stop counting the balances as part of expenditure, as the amendment proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with that. To disregard the use of balances would go far beyond what could be justified. I have said that, in exceptional circumstances, an authority designated for capping could make a case to Ministers. But, it would be going much too far if we were to throw away all the protection that has been given to the charge payer. We must not ignore the fact that the balances that have been drawn down were raised from taxpayers in the past or that the balances being built up today are at the expense of a higher tax burden on today's taxpayers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the changes were introduced, all political parties accepted that local authorities could use capital receipts over and above the spending plans that they submitted for grants as long as they remained within the limits defined by a prudent use of the money that they held on behalf of the ratepayer. That happened for a long time with the sale of council houses, which was the practice of many authorities before the Government pushed it forward as a policy. No problems were encountered then.<br><br>

Why do the Government now believe that there is a problem? Will the Minister accept that the aggravation and difficulty experienced by local authorities is too high a price for such political orthodoxy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first purpose of capping is to protect the public expenditure position. The hon. Lady is right to say that some local authorities sold council houses over a long period, but the opportunities and obligations stemming from our right-to-buy legislation have generated higher receipts for a much wider variety of authorities than ever before. There would be a major impact on public expenditure if all those receipts were spent suddenly. However, perhaps I can also explain the situation with a metaphor. If the hon. Lady owned a house worth £100,000 and had taken out a mortgage of £90,000, her level of indebtedness would be covered by her fiscal assets. That would be normal. But no one would suggest that it would be suitable to retain the mortgage if she sold the house. Similarly, it is appropriate for local authorities to have a level of indebtedness when they have a suitable level of assets—houses or any other physical assets—but when they get rid of some of those assets it is appropriate that they should reduce their levels of indebtedness. Therefore, it is right that a good proportion of the receipts that they get from the sale of assets should go to reducing indebtedness. Very few local authorities are without substantial levels of indebtedness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would agree that council housing was funded through the pooling effect, which his analogy does not cover, as houses that are paid for can still generate rent. Part of the regulations required that indebtedness be scaled down. Even so, in the south-west, for example, about £178 million has been held in district authorities this year. If that money were spent on building council houses instead of being kept in bank accounts, it would have a dramatic effect on homelessness and on creating jobs in the building trade. The Minister's argument simply does not hold water.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's party is a strong believer in creating jobs by spending public money, which has a good effect on destroying jobs elsewhere. Short circuit housing was used to ensure that the voids that exist in the property stocks of many local authorities were taken up and rendered habitable so that people could move into existing houses and the authorities did not have to build new ones.<br><br>
Although I said to the hon. Member for Bristol, South that we are willing to look at new evidence on standard spending assessments and make amendments when appropriate, the hon. Member for Brightside spoke well when he said that, with gearing as it stands currently, changes in SSAs can be disruptive. Therefore, although I wish to consider evidence presented to us, there must be reasonable stability in SSAs from year to year. Those considerations influence us each year when we decide on any changes to the SSAs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about capital receipts from the sale of council houses in response to a point from my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo). Some Conservative Back Benchers have been making an issue of the supposed differences between England and Scotland. There is a major difference between the Minister and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 757</span>
Stewart) on the question of capital receipts for council houses because councils in Scotland can use those receipts to build houses as part of their capital allocation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman risks getting my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) very excited. My hon. Friend may not have heard, and that is probably just as well.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) referred to parishes being brought within capping. I must emphasise that I do not want that to happen. The Bill includes a provision to bring the expenditure of parishes within the capping that would be imposed on districts. It is a question of bringing to bear the capping not on the parishes themselves, but on the precepts that they make on districts. However, I want to avoid that and I should use that power only if the potential abuse of districts passing over to parishes part of their activities so that they would do less and the parish precepts would increase, became a reality. If that were used to provide for leakage so that the parish precepts were rising, yet we were not bearing down in capping on the parish precepts, we should be obliged to act. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) might remember that I was worried about that when we debated the matter in the Chamber.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important issue. I remind the Minister of the understanding between district and parish councils, particularly in connection with the legislation on unitary authorities going through the other place, that parish councils could accept some of the responsibilities of district councils for providing services. I hope that I do not interpret the Minister's comments wrongly when he said that he would take action against the parish councils if that happened. The Minister should qualify that statement. A district council publication called "Closer to the People" tells of arrangements between parish councils and district council associations about certain functions. I hope that people abide by the principles contained in that document and that the Minister will not go back on his assurance to the parish councils that they would be recognised as providing certain functions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy for districts to make arrangements with parishes so that parishes can do work on an agency basis that is presently done by the district. In many places that would be good. The district would reimburse the parish and the charge would fall within the district's levy.<br><br>
If a parish provides services over and above the norm and then precepts upon the taxpayer via the district bill, I would be worried if for any reason those parish precepts rose significantly. Typically today they are between £2 and £5, but in some places they are as much as £25 or £30. That can occur in two ways. A parish may set out to provide extra services and precepts upon the taxpayer through the district, or it could be the result of connivance between the district and the parish—where the district says that it will not provide certain services but that the parish can because the parish precept is outside the capping procedure. If such abuse occurs, the powers under clause 54(6) would have to be invoked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Parish councils are worried not about new functions but about concurrent functions, which have been a bone of contention between the parishes and districts for a long time. If parishes want to add to their responsibilities those concurrent functions that they can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 758</span>
carry out, they would obviously have to precept the district for them. The district would be wise to allow the parish council to carry out those functions because of the capping that applies to smaller district councils. Does the Minister agree that there is nothing wrong with parish councils precepting to carry out those of their statutory functions that may be concurrent with the district's functions? The Minister said that £5 or £6 would be a reasonable parish precept; that compares with £31 under the poll tax. Has the Minister something in mind about where the cut off should be. If he has, he should tell us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a figure in mind, but I suspect that we shall be able to smell abuse if it occurs. There was a hint of it in what the hon. Gentleman said, when he mentioned that because the districts could be capped and the parishes could not, they would be wise to move some of their functions over to the parishes. That worried me. If a parish carries out services for a district, one of two things should follow; either it should be done on an agency basis and the district should pay the parish for doing it, or the district should charge less to the people in that parish than they charge elsewhere so that the sum of what the parish and the district charge is near what other areas in the district are being charged.<br><br>
I am concerned about a shift of functions between the district and the parish for the reason to which the hon. Gentleman alluded—it might take some district spending out of the capping regime.</span></p>
<p>10.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the issue, but it is important to people in rural and urban communities. Let us consider, for example, a leisure centre which, through no fault of a district council, is to be closed because of the savings that must be made to avoid capping. That is happening throughout the country, including areas with which I am familiar. Let us suppose that, as the centre is important to that area, the parish decides to take it on, thus incurring the expenditure that was previously picked up by the district. I am not saying that in that case the district offered it to the parish, rather that the parish council chose voluntarily to keep that facility open.<br><br>
Because of the gearing impact of a local tax that bears entirely on the domestic payer, there would have to be a dramatic change in precept to achieve a relatively small increase in the parish council's overall budget. In the Minister's view, would such action constitute an abuse of the system? Would the position be different if the parish council built the community facility from scratch and were opening it at a time when the gearing effect had a similar impact on its expenditure, as though it had taken it over from the district?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make judgments about specific cases. Our discussion has given me a valuable chance to say that there is an opportunity for abuse, and that we must be on the look out for it. It is wise that we should have the reserve power under clause 54 to deal with such an abuse. I should not like to say in advance when one would judge that such abuse had occurred and when one would invoke that power, but I am pleased to have the opportunity to issue a warning that the powers might have to be used in certain circumstances. However, it is not our intention that they should be used; I should prefer that the world continues as it does at present, with parishes coming in with low bills which are tolerable locally.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 759</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti<span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will forgive me if I refer to the Secretary of State who said some time ago that small local authorities would not be considered for capping. However, we know that they now have been. For years, many parish councils in Sussex have provided excellent facilities in their parishes. I hope that the Minister will not take on reserve powers that could lead to some of those parish councils not being able to do the work that they have done so well for so long. Polegate town council, for example, provides a community centre with a playing field and, for historical reasons, there is a fair burden on the community.<br><br>
Barcombe parish council in Sussex is considering building a new sports centre. That would certainly lead to £25 to £30 per head being put on the charge. I hope that the Minister can give me a reassuring response, because many villages in Sussex would be hit if the reserve powers were used. The provision could destroy the whole of rural life in Sussex.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends on who wants to be reassured. Naturally, charge payers and taxpayers want to be reassured, and I know many who are worried about the potential of parish spending. The hon. Gentleman has seen the issues only through the eyes of the parish rather than of the people who pay. We shall not be capping parishes. Clause 54 provides the opportunity to bring within the capping of districts the precepts that are placed on them by parishes. I hope to avoid using that power, but if it were believed that an abuse had occurred, it would have to be used to protect the council tax payer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the concurrent functions of parish and district councils. Parishes allow dual use of school playing fields, but, because some schools have opted out, those playing fields are not necessarily available for use by people in the parish. The parish council could therefore be responsible for providing alternative playing fields.<br><br>
Parish councils have duties and responsibilities under the Local Government Act 1972 which run concurrently with some of the district functions. If a district could not sustain a service and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) suggested, a parish took over a sports centre, would the Minister invoke section 54 to ensure that the parish did not carry out that function? The Minister does not intend to cap the parishes, but capping the districts might mean that they, in turn, capped the parishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I were to invoke that power, I should ensure that the bill to the council tax payer was limited; it would include charges relating to county, district and other levying and precepting authorities and parishes.<br><br>
On the hon. Gentleman's first point, I have nothing to add to what I have already said. A parish that provides services on behalf of the district can do so on an agency basis—the district charges less to people in that parish because the parish charges them. It is possible that, because of the present capping rules, some districts might spot an opportunity for passing responsibilities to parishes. Parish precepts would therefore rise, in which case I should be concerned and have to consider whether clause 54 should be used.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding was worried that his amendment might be technically defective. I shall not insult him by discussing its technical merits, but I want to discuss the merits of his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 760</span>
argument. I understand perfectly his frustration, irritation and anger on behalf of his law-abiding constituents. That anger was shared by others of my hon. Friends, some of whom spoke on behalf of their law-abiding constituents who make the full payment.<br><br>
The problem is not exclusively the result of the community charge. We pay more for the goods we buy when we go shopping because of shoplifting, or shrinkage, as it is euphemistically called. We pay more than we should in income tax because of income tax evasion. We paid more in rates because of rates evasion. My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) mentioned Liverpool. It was interesting that the proportion of rates collected was lower than the proportion of the community charge collected.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham must have realised that many authorities reported huge deficits on their rent accounts even when collectors took payments of rent and rates together. It may not have occurred to the hon. Gentleman to ask why the rates account was fully credited in those authorities whose rent account was in deficit when the rent and rates were collected together. In some local authorities, it was an accounting convention to credit a sum collected first to the rate account. The rate accounts therefore looked extremely rosy compared with the rent accounts. The people who did not pay were not especially concerned with whether the amount owed was for rent or rates—they were not paying either. The extent of underpayment of rates has been underestimated in many places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. What he said is true in many cases. Will he reconsider what he said about goods in shops, because that is surely more similar to the case to which my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding referred? If prices had to be increased in a particular shop because there was much shrinkage or wastage, fewer goods would be sold and the shop might go out of business. To prevent that, the shop would find ways to reduce shrinkage and compete with other shops. Is that what my hon. Friend suggested should happen to local government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is what my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding suggested. He said that he wanted to remove the "monstrous injustice" of some people paying more than others and some not paying at all. Part of the problem with the amendment is that it would not remove the monstrous injustice of those who do not pay. To solve that problem, we need to look to local authorities to make a better effort to collect the community charge, and the council tax when it is introduced. Unfortunately, whatever my hon. Friend says, he should realise that his amendment would not make non-payers pay.<br><br>
The amendment would oblige local authorities to spend less than they otherwise would do. That raises two problems. First, the law-abiding citizen—about whom my hon. Friends the Members for Stamford and Spalding, for Wyre and for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and I are concerned—would have to pay the full bill but receive services below the standard set by the local authority. In other words, a law-abider loses out, not because he has to pay his own bill and part of someone else's but because he has to pay his own bill and receive poor services.<br><br>
Secondly, some local authorities might spend less than the SSA on essential services which they have statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0441">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 761</span>
duties to provide. That would place the Government in a curious position. We would be saying that, on the one hand, the SSA represents an appropriate sum for the local authority but, on the other, we shall cap the local authority so that it spends less than that sum. That would be invidious.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding also said that the amendment would increase the pressure on local authorities to collect the tax. That is connected with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre. It is difficult to be sure about the effectiveness of the amendment. Some local authorities are in such a hopeless state that such pressure might not work. After all, some local authorities do a bad job of collecting rents. That feeds all the way through to housing revenue accounts, to the rents that authorities need to charge and to the fewer repairs which they can carry out. That does not seem to influence them; they do not collect rents more effectively.<br><br>
Lambeth is so indebted from its failure to collect rates, non-domestic rates and the community charge that it has to pay large sums to service old debts. Therefore, Lambeth now spends below SSA on some of its services. The fact that it is already forced to provide lesser services than it would wish or than are thought appropriate has not obliged Lambeth to do a better job of collecting the community charge. What appears to be a remedy that might make local authorities collect taxes more effectively has not had that result in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand my hon. Friend's argument about Lambeth. I agree that it is sad that councillors in Lambeth are not prepared to come to grips with the problem. It is interesting that councillors have managed to do so in Liverpool where the same situation applies. The debt charges are so high that services are well below standard. It seems that the people of Liverpool have seen the light and are using competitive tendering to improve services. Does my hon. Friend think that Liverpool is coming to terms with its financial situation? It has faced up to reality and is trying to do something about it.</span></p>
<p>10.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The factors in Liverpool are many and varied. Thank goodness that Militant has been driven from office and that the Government can now work with the regime in Liverpool to help people. It is marvellous that a Labour authority is embracing competitive tendering with enthusiasm. Competition is the way to provide better services and better value for money. Liverpool has also embraced city challenge without the carping tone which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) adopted when he spoke about it.<br><br>
The Liverpool authority is now positive although it is Labour controlled. It went to the edge of hell with Militant and now acknowledges the need for a different regime. It can see that Conservative solutions, in some respects, are the best for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is 100 per cent, right about the Lambeth authority. I understand that it has wasted some £62 million, which would have avoided debt charges. My hon. Friend's amendments would not mean going back to the depths that resulted from the community charge but would make sure that, once the new system is set up, the situation does not recur.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 762</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I understand the aim of the amendment. I was simply trying to study the evidence and decide whether, when a local authority has to depress the level of services because it has failed to collect, it is made to respond. It is evident that Lambeth has not responded. I am therefore rather doubtful about the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), although I wish that it was borne out by the evidence.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) pointed out the many difficulties created by Labour councillors and Labour Members who advocated non-payment. It is good to hear Labour Front-Bench spokesmen say that they want nothing to do with advocating non-payment. One wishes that one had heard their voices more strongly in the past and that they could be more precise about the position of the Labour Front Bench and of all Labour Members on the issue. The hon. Member for Brightside said the other day that the number of Labour Members advocating non-payment is not 30. That is marvellous. Whatever the number is, it is not 30. Unfortunately, we do not know what the number is. It must be higher than zero or the hon. Gentleman would have said that it was zero.<br><br>
A number of Labour Members are still dedicated to advocating non-payment and some 300 councillors have been identified as doing so. That is part of the problem and I hope that we can eradicate it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to know that the chairman of finance of my Labour-controlled county council—the man guilty of imposing an extra £100 on every adult in our county—did not pay his poll tax until a court order was issued. That was the sort of example that I tried to persuade the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to repudiate earlier in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is intolerable that people who are elected to positions on authorities do not pay their taxes or community charge.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding has done the Committee a great service. He enabled us to have a serious debate in which my hon. Friends made strong arguments on behalf of their constituents who are very angry at having to make payments for other people. However, much though I should like to accept my hon. Friend's amendment, it would not provide a helpful way forward because it would cause the problems which I described to him.<br><br>
I thoroughly agree with my hon. Friend that the solution to the problem is that local authorities should apply themselves to collecting the community charge now and the council tax in future. They will be better able to do so if they do not have to act against a background noise of the advocacy of non-payment by Labour councillors and Members of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have finished my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee with just a further short speech.<br><br>
I am not surprised that the Minister was anxious to conclude, as he may have glimpsed the point that I wish to put to him. I agreed with a good deal of his argument to explain why the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) was unacceptable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0442">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 763</span>
and unworkable. It was a first-class analysis of the weaknesses of the proposal and we would gladly adopt much of his argument. I regret, however, that he persisted in sweeping aside all evidence of the tremendous efforts made by local authorities to collect the poll tax. He refused to accept any Government responsibility for introducing the wretched scheme in the first place and for confusing matters so badly as to make the problem of collecting the tax even worse.<br><br>
I rose in the hope of catching the Minister before he sat down so resolutely because his rejection of his hon. Friend's amendment left me a little puzzled. My brief speech was unfortunately prolonged by a number of interventions, most to the effect that amendment No. 232 was indistinguishable from amendment No. 303. I was constantly asked why I rejected the one, at least in principle, while my hon. Friends supported the other.<br><br>
The Minister may wish to consult the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, but can he explain why he has announced his determination to resist his hon. Friend's amendment in relation to south of the border, whereas we have been assured that he intends to support amendment No. 303 in relation to north of the border? Will he explain that apparent diversity of view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will confirm that amendment No. 303 has been tabled in his name and that of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I said that I am minded, in a spirit of compromise and consensus, to accept amendment No. 303 in relation to Scotland. But, of course, I wish to listen to the debate and to the strong advocacy of the amendment which will no doubt come from the Opposition Front Bench.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we heard the scrabbling sound of the Under-Secretary climbing down rapidly. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was able to consult his ministerial friend south of the border in the two-hour break for dinner—he may have been told that he made a little mistake on that occasion—otherwise, as I believe <i>Hansard</i> will show, he will have to eat his words. We will be interested to learn on what ground he will decide to go back on that firm assurance, which we understand was given on the Lord Advocate's advice, and abandon the course which he proposed to the Committee.<br><br>
The amendment stands on the amendment paper— nothing has changed. The Under-Secretary must surely have been familiar with the Minister's arguments against the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding, so what has changed? What has induced the Under-Secretary to tell us, even before the debate on amendment No. 303 has begun, that he is climbing down? This is a good instance of one Minister not knowing what the other is doing and of a different view being taken south of the border.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way with his customary courtesy. I look forward to the Opposition pushing amendment No. 303 to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An object lesson had been delivered to Conservative Members: if they wish to use the weapon of consistency and the charge of inconsistency they should be extremely careful. We have an excellent example of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 764</span>
precisely such inconsistency—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) stirs. When I challenged him to show whether there was a greater debt collection exercise in the history of the world than the current exercise that involves 7-5 million summonses, he replied by demonstrating his tremendous knowledge of the South American continent: he managed to name two countries. But that is as far as he went. Has he used the two hours that we had for dinner to do some research and produce figures to show that in either of the two countries he mentioned, or in any other country, a larger debt collection exercise has ever taken place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was merely pointing out that, by definition, debt collecting is greater in South America than it is in this country. The debt owed by many countries in South America to many countries in the rest of the world, such as the United States, is far greater than any debt in this country. The hon. Gentleman said that there was nowhere else in the world where so much was owed: I pointed out that there was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the hon. Gentleman's endearing qualities is his ability to fly by the seat of his pants. His notion that the third-world debt, which is certainly greater in terms of total indebtedness, is to be compared to a debt collection exercise of the sort in which local government is currently involved is very engaging, but hardly persuasive.<br><br>
I have successfully dealt in my brief speech with two of the main themes of the constant interventions made during my earlier speech. I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why his earlier statement is now inoperative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long and full debate. Much of it had been about amendment No. 232.<br><br>
I explained at the beginning of my remarks this evening that I was clear in my own mind that my amendment was not the last word on the subject. I said that consequential changes in the Bill might be required to make it effective.<br><br>
My primary purpose was to launch, but not to complete this evening, the process of changing the law on this important issue. To my surprise and great pleasure, two purposes have been achieved tonight. First, we have been able to air the principle enshrined in my amendment. One of the great functions of Back Benchers is to air new principles and prepare the ground for a change that the Government might see their way to making in the future and so make thinkable what, until now, has been unthinkable. Nothing has been said this evening to dampen my optimism, so we have made some progress.<br><br>
I was grateful for the extremely thoughtful and sympathetic comments of my hon. Friend the Minister. He drew an analogy between local government finance and the private sector. He said that the public are charged higher prices to pay for shoplifting, but that point was answered extremely convincingly by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans).<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
There is a difference between the situations of local government and supermarkets and the private sector in general. Supermarkets and the private sector have a natural market inducement to minimise shoplifting, to keep their turnover up and to maximise their profit margins, but there is no such inducement in local government. One of the purposes of my amendment is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 765</span>
introduce one. So, far from invalidating my amendment, my hon. Friend the Minister has reinforced the case for it by introducing that interesting analogy.<br><br>
The Minister went on to say that if my amendment, or a selective version of it, were incorporated into law, an authority with a particularly bad record of collection might have to cut services below SSA level. I accept the logic of my hon. Friend's argument, but the example of Lambeth, which my hon. Friend the Minister quoted, bears out the good sense of my amendment. Lambeth is already delivering services below the SSA level. It is necessary and right that that should be the ultimate sanction, otherwise we would be in the absurd position of saying that a little extravagance will be penalised by effective capping but a frenzy of extravagance, such as that undertaken by some Labour-controlled authorities, can be embarked upon with impunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like a skilful dentist, my hon. Friend has gone straight for the cavity. When I used the Lambeth analogy, I realised that my hon. Friend might make that point. However, there is a big difference between Lambeth living with the consequences of its actions—debts have built up and it now has to spend below its SSA on some services—and the Government capping Lambeth council at a level that takes account of its non-collection, which obliges it to spend below SSA level. The SSA level represents what the Government deem to be an appropriate level of spending. So while Lambeth is facing the consequences of its own actions, my hon. Friend is asking the Government to force it into spending less than the Government deem to be appropriate. That would put the Government in an illogical position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of my amendment is to get local authorities to consider it to be their responsibility to collect the council tax. It would not be open to them to say that it was not their fault that they had failed to collect the council tax. They must bear the responsibility because it is in the front line of local government. We have not yet exhausted the arguments for the amendment.<br><br>
Some time before a local authority reached the point where it would have to cut its statutory services, it would have to cut its discretionary services. The law would force it to do so in the same way as it forces a council to cut its discretionary expenditure. Cutting its discretionary expenditure might not cause many of its citizens to suffer—in fact, the reverse might be true. Discretionary expenditure would cover the absurd things, such as industrial development departments, local authority foreign policy departments, delegations to Nicaragua and nuclear-free zones. We have had them all.<br><br>
Lest it be thought that I am making an easy, demagogic point, I shall refer directly to a relatively responsible authority. South Holland district council is in part represented in the House of Commons by me and in part by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Sir R. Body). Sadly, it is not a Conservative council, but it is far from being run by financially irresponsible extremists. However, even that council could afford to make some major cuts in its discretionary expenditure. Thanks to my efforts and to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston, it has already cut a substantial amount of its unnecessary tourist expenditure. It has already considered the leasing of vehicles for the first time, and has begun to examine zero-based budgeting, which it had never heard of until I spoke about it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 766</span>
Unfortunately, neither I nor my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston was able to persuade South Holland district council to forgo the construction of beautiful new offices, at a cost of £3 million, for which no study of future manning levels and space requirements was ever undertaken. That shows that there is an awful lot of fat to be pared away before we can get down to the so-called essential services, about which my hon. Friend the Minister is right to be so concerned.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) speaks so eloquently on behalf of Wandsworth that I occasionally associate him directly with that borough, but he delineated with great effectiveness and clarity what will be my final point. The amendment would help the new council tax to get off to a good start. Now is the appropriate time to review the system that operated throughout the regimes both of the rates and of the community charge. I hope that our full discussion of the subject this evening will promote new thinking on this important matter by my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues in the Department of the Environment.<br><br>
We have had a very useful and pleasurable debate, which has achieved something that I had not anticipated—that is, we appear to have exposed the most extraordinary embarrassment among Opposition Members. We have had the pleasure of witnessing the classic symptoms of acute political discomfiture. Opposition Members have contributed irrelevancies by the score. There have even been personal attacks—a sure sign of desperation. I am glad that that is not characteristic of the conduct of the House, or even of most Opposition Members.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) emitted a fog of words during his two speeches, the first of which lasted more than 40 minutes. We are used to the hon. Gentleman's somewhat self-satisfied strutting and his avoidance of difficult questions, but this evening he surpassed himself. Above all, we have had the pleasure—we would be less than human if we had not savoured it—of seeing the hon. Gentleman pretend that he did not understand the purport of his amendment. That makes the evening particularly memorable and delectable.<br><br>
We have achieved two purposes tonight; we have certainly achieved more than I hoped when I started speaking to the amendment nearly six hours ago. It has been a useful debate. I am confident that we shall hear more of the principle that is enshrined in the amendment, but not, I hope, of the particular words, because I set no store by them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) speaks with the artificial indignation of a bowl of Dream Topping. His speech was full of heat and passion about cutting services and damaging the most vulnerable people. He is amused by the idea that authorities might be capped for expenditure that they were not able to raise under a tax that was inflicted by his right hon. and hon. Friends. That was as convincing as his ignoring what is happening with the Treasury budget. My hon. Friend for Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) mentioned earlier that between £4 billion and £5 billion of public money was uncollected by the Treasury last year, including over £1 billion of VAT, all of which has to be added to other people's bills. The figures that were given to me yesterday in reply to a written question showed not only non-collection, but the writing off of key parts of our

tax revenue. Last year, £212 of value added tax was written off. The Treasury wrote off £364 billion of income tax, and even managed to write off £184 of corporation tax—not uncollected but simply written off. Conservative Members, who are so keen to penalise local government, might take those figures home in the early hours of this morning and mull over the penalties that might apply to themselves. Those who have a house made of glass throweth the first stone—whether the house is in Dulwich, once owned and occupied by the Thatcher family, or that lived in by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding. We have suffered a dose of hypocristy of the worst order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have hypocrisy in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My sentiments exactly. I take your point, Sir Michael,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Gentleman cannot have it, nor must he assume it in others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. A degree of duplicity—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member would enhance his cause if he were to withdraw the word altogether.</span></p>

A Minister of State who claims to have support in Liverpool, when the Conservatives have only two elected councillors there, has the cheek of the devil. If that is support, the Liberal Democrats are in danger of taking over Britain. As the rural communities of Sussex collapse under the new legislation, that prospect is likely.<br><br>
The Minister's answers about the use of balancing and capping were not at all convincing. But as we must get to equally important matters, which include further anomalies and absurdity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 265, in page 22, line 33, leave out subsection (9).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 298, in clause 43, page 30, line 25, leave out subsection (7).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, as the guillotine approaches. This is a probing amendment. It seeks answers to two questions about clause 32(9). First, what is meant by the two separate powers specified in clause 32(9)? Clause 32(9)(a) refers to altering the constituents of any calculation, whereas clause 32(9)(b) refers to altering the rules governing the making of any calculation. What is the distinction between the two?<br><br>
Secondly, we should like to know in what circumstances the powers would be used. Will the Minister assure us that he will not change the definition? It is important to the question of capping, which can only further confuse and restrict the freedoms of local authorities as they seek stability as they prepare their budgets and financial futures. Will the Minister assure us that the power will not be used to change the rules of the game to the disadvantage of local authorities?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 768</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would remove the Secretary of State's power to make regulations to alter the constituents of the budget requirement calculation and to alter the rule for making that calculation. The amendment is designed to identify when and how the powers are to be used.<br><br>
There is nothing new in this power. It is carried forward from subsection (8) of section 95 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which deals with the calculations under the community charge which are equivalent to the budget requirement calculation under the council tax. It was accepted by Parliament then and there is no reason why it should not be acceptable now.<br><br>
With such a contingency provision it is always difficult to identify precisely when and how it would be used. The power in the 1988 Act has not been invoked, and, in answer to the hon. Gentleman's second question, we see no need for it in the last year of the present system.<br><br>
However, it would be a rash for any Minister to assure the Committee that the constituents of the budget requirement calculation would never need to be changed. The power might need to be used in the light of changes elsewhere in the local government finance system. Parliament would have the usual opportunity to review any regulations under the negative resolution procedure.<br><br>
There is no intention at the moment of changing budgets. But we must keep in reserve, as we did in the 1988 Act, the possibility of doing so, should it become necessary. I can think of no circumstances in which subsection (9) would be used to make such regulations. The fact that the provision has not been used since 1988 shows that we hold it as a reserve power. At present there is no intention to use that power, but it would be foolish not to have it. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's second question.<br><br>
On constituency calculations, the elements of revenue and expenditure are set out in subsections (2) and (3), and the rules of calculation of how constituents are treated are set out in subsections (5) to (8). I hope that I have assured the hon. Gentleman about the budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I had expected more reassurance than that, and I am not reassured by an argument that rests on the precedent established by the 1988 Act. However, as this is a probing amendment, and I did not expect the Minister to be more helpful than he has been, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>where—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>GCT is the gross council tax for the year calculated by adding together for all bands of property, the number of dwellings in each band multiplied by the sum of the amounts calculated for that band under sections 36(1) and 47(1) below;</p></blockquote>

<br><blockquote><p>CC are the costs of collection for the year which are reductions in the liability to pay council tax arising out of regulations under paragraphs 6 and 7 of Schedule 2 or any similar regulations;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>LC are losses on collection arising from the total of:
<ol>
<li>Council tax due in the year written off in respect of dwellings and former dwellings;</li>
<li>Discounts due in the year arising from the application of section 11 above;</li>
<li>Council tax due on dwellings but for the provisions of section 4 above; and</li>
<li>such part of reduced amounts arising in the year under section 13 above and such part of council tax benefit paid under section 101 below that is not reimbursed out of money provided by Parliament;</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>DTR is the council tax applicable to a Band D dwelling for the year including all council tax amounts applicable for that area as set under paragraph (1) above, section 44(1) below.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5A) A local authority may estimate the value of T in making a calculation under paragraph (1) above on the basis of the best information it has available at the time.'.</p></blockquote>
I hope to be as brief in speaking to this amendment as I was in speaking to the previous amendment. The amendment would remove the Secretary of State's regulatory powers in respect of defining the tax base of a council. The amendment would insert into the Bill a clear definition of the tax base.<br><br>
The Bill implies that the tax base consists of the number of dwellings in the authority expressed as numbers of band D properties. For example, a band H property is equivalent to two band D properties, so that the amount of council tax payable on a band H property is twice that for a band D property. The amendment arrives at that definition by dividing the amount of council tax collected by the tax rate on a band D property. That is analogous to the definition of the penny rate product under the rating system.<br><br>
The amendment states that the amount of council tax collected is equivalent to the total amount that could be collected—defined as gross council tax—less the cost of collection as defined, and less losses on collection. The total that could be collected is the total of each property multipled by the tax rate of its band.<br><br>
The method of calculation is essentially circular, and the amendment would make that clear. That is the point of any calculation under the proposals. We want the Minister to accept that. The actual tax base of an authority can be determined only after the end of the financial year when all information on discounts, costs, losses and tax rate is known. That is what the Bill will do; it is the invariable practice. However, the amendment has the merit of making that clear.<br><br>
I had intended to elaborate my argument, but given the late hour and the imminence of the guillotine, I shall ask the Minister to comment on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) raised and important and interesting issue. I shall start by explaining tax bases. Some members of the Committee are less technically minded than others.<br><br>
Taxbases are a measure of the taxable capacity of an area for the purposes of determining local tax. Under the rating system, the tax base was framed in terms of rateable values, as that was the currency of that system. Under the community charge, relevant population—that is, the number of adults—is used. Under the council tax, we propose that it should be based on an equivalent number of band D dwellings in the area, adjusted for discounts.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 770</span>
The tax base in the new system will be used by billing and major precepting authorities to calculate the amount of their council tax. As the amendment recognises, the tax base must be more than merely a measure of the number of dwellings, adjusted for discounts in an area, because it represents the area's taxable capacity. That depends on a number of other factors. We accept that and propose that the rules for calculating the tax base should take account of the effect on an authority's council tax income of factors such as exemptions, discounts and disabled relief. It must be a measure of taxable capacity throughout the financial year, so account must be taken of changes in circumstances that an authority forecasts will occur in the relevant financial year.<br><br>
We propose that the rules will enable an authority to make such allowance as it considers appropriate for council taxes due for the year that it believes will ultimately be non-collectable. That means that the taxes set by both tiers of authority will provide in the year for an appropriate allowance for non-collection. Authorities can use only that information that is currently available to them.<br><br>
These are our proposals for the regulations and we have already made them known, in outline, to the local authority associations and to local authorities in general. We shall make draft regulations available for consultation shortly.<br><br>
Our intentions for the calculation of the tax base are not very different from the concepts underpinning the amendment. It would not be right to put in primary legislation the rules for a calculation such as this because they must reflect current circumstances. For example, the rules will need to reflect the reductions that our disabled relief system introduces, which will be specified in regulations.<br><br>
I hope that in explaining the technical basis of the system I have allayed the hon. Gentleman's fears and that he will not, therefore, press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to press the amendment, but a gulf remains between the Under-Secretary and the Opposition. It would be advantageous to set out the rules in the Bill.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said several times that the tax base would be the number of properties net of discount. The advantage of the amendment is that discount, exemptions and one or two other things are shown as losses on collection, which is how they are properly regarded. That emphasises our contention that, as a consequence of those losses, the average bill must be higher. I am sorry that we could not persuade the hon. Gentleman to accept the amendment, but at least he recognises that the calculation is difficult. He has given assurances on the regulations being drafted, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, in view of the impending guillotine. These are important, probing amendments. Their purpose is to require the Secretary of State to make regulations governing the calculations of an authority's tax base by 30 June in the year preceding the relevant year. We want to elicit information from the Government on how the tax base will be calculated.<br><br>
The Government said that an authority's tax base will be adjusted to take into account properties exempt from council tax and personal discounts. Total exemptions in the country are not far short of 1 million—a tremendous number of properties that are likely to be exempt from paying the tax. Local authorities will need to know as quickly as possible the precise nature of the tax base from which they have to work. Further information is awaited on the details of the calculation and how authorities will obtain the information necessary for the adjustments to be made.<br><br>
The Minister was somewhat unkind to local government; the poor old parish councils were accused of being in a conspiracy with district authorities to try to diddle the Government. Here is a chance for the Minister to be kind and helpful to local government.</span></p>
<p>11.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his brevity. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary commented on how the tax base will be calculated, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman can read about that in <i>Hansard.</i><br><br>
The Government are committed to issuing at the earliest possible moment regulations containing rules for calculating the tax base. We have explained our approach in one of a series of papers which we have just circulated to all local authorities in England. We intend shortly to consult local authority associations on draft regulations and the accompanying practice notes. We hope to make the regulations as soon as possible after the Bill receives Royal Assent.<br><br>
For 1993–94, authorities will know the rules for calculating the tax base well in advance of the deadline that the amendment proposes. We are making every effort to provide local authorities with early information about the proposed rules for calculating the tax base because that is needed for the design of computer software for the council tax. After the council tax is established, there will no longer be the same need. Authorities will not be in a position to begin calculating their tax base until around December. They will not know the details for the proposed RSG settlement until about the same time. We intend to communicate any changes in the rules for calculating the tax base well in advance of that time.<br><br>
There is no advantage in the time limit suggested in the amendment for either the billing authorities or the major precepting authorities that will need information from billing authorities about their own tax bases. It would place an undesirable limit on the Secretary of State's power to amend the rules for the tax base if, for example, new circumstances arose after 30 June in the preceding year. Whatever the tax base turns out to be, the revenue support grant due to authorities is calculated on that tax base. The authorities obviously need to know well in advance how to calculate the tax base, and we can do that for them. The sensible time to come to conclusions about the tax base for the following year is at the end of the calendar year, when the Government make clear their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 772</span>
proposals for grants. That is the appropriate timetable under our present tax system and under the proposed council tax system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been kinder to local government than he was earlier. As he said that he will consult local authority associations, and I hope, gain a mutual agreement, and as, happily, the council tax will not see the light of day, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would ensure that the tax shown as being set for part of an area, because of a parish precept or special expenses, would reflect an allocation of some grant and some business rate, instead of the whole amount. It is what might be called a parochial amendment and as such is certain to attract the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien).<br><br>
Under the poll tax, government grant and non-domestic rates are paid into a collection fund. Local authorities demand the total amount that they require to spend from that fund and the resulting deficit is made good by the calculation of poll tax for the area. No poll tax rate is unique to one or other tier of local government. The council tax will revert to the procedure under the rates. Each major tier will be paid a share of grant and business rate and will calculate its tax rate. The tax rates will then be added together to calculate the whole tax rate for the area. The problem is that that puts parish and town councils at a disadvantage—a point which my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton has made several times. Parish and town councils do not receive a direct share of either the grant or the business rate, so their tax rate represents the full amount of their expenditure.<br><br>
Under the rating system, that meant that parish councils sometimes seemed to be spending more than the districts in which they were situated, even though the districts were spending much more within the area as a whole. The position will be worse under the council tax. Under the rates, at least the parishes received a share of the business rate. That will not happen under the council tax. The amendment would overcome that problem by calculating the tax rate for special expenses and local council precepts, by assuming that such expenditure attracts grant and business rate at the same percentage rate as for the average for the area as a whole. That would ensure that all tax rates are in proportion to the spending that the tier of authority incurs.<br><br>
I accept that, in some sense, the change would be purely presentational. But it would help parish councils, which have sometimes been attacked unfairly by local tax payers on the ground that they are precepting for far too high a rate. That puts them at a disadvantage and is misleading. I hope that the Minister will recognise the point behind such a presentational argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman's point is slightly more than presentational, and I am worried about it. I refer to the expenditure that a billing authority incurs in a part of its area on a function performed elsewhere in its area by the parish. In such circumstances, the presumption is that, unless the billing authority resolves otherwise, that expenditure shall be a special item in the same way that a precept from the local precepting authority is a special item.<br><br>
The interaction of parish precepts and the expenditure that the billing authority incurs in other parts of its area on the functions undertaken by the parish council in the parish area is an important subject for debate. Treating the billing authority expenditure as a special expense to be borne only in the area where the billing authority undertakes those functions—will result, under the Bill, in

the amounts of tax in both the parish and non-parish areas being the same, provided that, on their concurrent functions, both the parish council and billing authority provide the same level of service with the same degree of efficiency. When the authorities are providing services at a higher level, it is only right that people should pay more.<br><br>
If a parish is providing a service that is additional to the standard level of service, the amendment would enable part of the expenditure that the parish was making to provide that service above the standard level to be funded by national non-domestic rates and revenue support grant. But, because that expenditure is above the standard level, it would not be right to disguise the full effect of that extra spending on the local tax payers. Similarly, if a district spends above its standard spending assessment, that extra spending falls entirely on the community charge and, in future, will fall on the council tax. Therefore, if the parish were providing additional expenditure over and above the standard level of service, it is right that the total amount of that spending should fall on the parish precept and not be reduced or disguised by payments of national non-domestic rates or revenue support grant.<br><br>
The amendment is more than presentational; it would make a substantial difference to the provisions and would go against the principle that underlies both the community charge and the council tax under which additional marginal expenditure over and above the standard level should be met by local charge payers exclusively and not by payment of revenue support grant or redistributed non-domestic rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely convinced that all the Minister's remarks were directly relevant to the amendment. However, I detected a worrying hostility to the role of parish councils in local government. He did not appear to be prepared to accept the legitimacy of their expenditure and their right, exercised under the poll tax, for example, to an equal share of grant and the business rate. Our proposal would ensure that they would not, in the public's opinion carry the can for the legitimate expenditure that they propose and carry through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The early part of my remarks, which I read, may have been lost on the hon. Gentleman. Where the districts and parishes fulfil concurrent functions, the Bill provides that the assumption should be that the district will impose a bill on its taxpayers in those areas where the parish fulfils some of its functions that are lower than in those areas where it does not. The arrangement will be that bills in those areas where a standard level of service is jointly provided by the district and the parish will be no higher than in those areas where no parish exists.<br><br>
Everything will work out neatly at a standard level of service. The district will receive the RSG and the redistributed non-domestic rates, but it will arrange with the parish so that the parish levy and the district charge add up to the same amount as the charge levied by the district in those areas where there are no parishes. The difficulty arises if the parish provides services over and above the standard level. In that case, just as the council tax payer would meet the whole expense if the district spent over the standard spending assessment, the council tax payer would meet the whole expense of parish spending on the provision of additional services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recommend that in future the Minister does not read his notes but instead explains matters in his own words, although I think that I understood what he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0448">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 775</span>
said. However, that still leaves a sense of unease. If the district provides a level of services over and above the standard level, that extra element is incorporated in the tax being charged by the district. If the parish provides the extra services, the lump sum will be closely identified with the parish. That will be a substantial sum for the parish, and will give the impression of being a very large sum in that context. The result will be that the parish will be exposed to the displeasure of local taxpayers, who will not be able to mitigate what might be an important proportion of their precept, even if in cash terms the actual element of extra spending is rather small.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw my hon. Friend's attention to the fact that the Minister is referring to differential rating in areas where parishes exist. Clearly, that could create tremendous administrative problems. A separate bill will have to be issued within the parish, telling taxpayers what the district rate is. That rate will be less than the average district rate. In addition, another bill will have to tell them the parish rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the situation as I understand it. Does my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) agree that the Minister said that people who live in a parish that provides services and which attracts the non-domestic rate and the revenue support grant will not pay more than those who receive similar services elsewhere in the district? The council tax payers in that parish will therefore receive the bill for the parish rate. That bill must be lower than that received by people in unparished areas of the district. Otherwise, more would be charged in the parish areas, so there would be differential ratings.<br><br>
When local government was reorganised in 1972, it was argued that differential rating should be done away with. Now, we have the introduction of differential rating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Minister will confirm that there is a real possibility of differential rating and that the rate in an area that is parished might well be higher than it is elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>11.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present, districts are able to charge different amounts in respect of those areas which are parished and where services are being provided by a parish, but not all of them do so. We receive many complaints that although, a blanket charge is imposed everywhere, in areas where services are provided by a parish in place of a district the parish precept sits on top and people pay more, even for a standard level of service.<br><br>
The Bill inserts the presumption that special arrangements will be made where parishes provide concurrent services, so that the total bill for a standard level of service between the parish and the district taken together will be the same as in a non-parished area where all those services are provided by the district. I hope that I shall not have to repeat that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) seems to have misunderstood the position. In no circumstances do RSG and the non-domestic rate pass to the parish. A district which has responsibility for a range of services receives RSG and non-domestic rates. Where it chooses to allow a parish to provide some of those services on its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 776</span>
behalf, the amount that the parish needs to charge for that, and the amount by which the district bill is reduced in recognition, is decided in the context of the RSG and the NNDR which is received by the district.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the debate because we are anxious to move on. However, while I am sure that the Minister has done his best to answer our queries, I feel that he has left a number unanswered. We shall need to consider his remarks in the light of comments made in earlier debates.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

PRECEPTING AND PRECEPTED AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 261, in page 27, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(g) a metropolitan passenger transport authority.'</p></blockquote>
By necessity, I shall be brief because we are less than half an hour away from the guillotine and I know that my hon. Friends wish to comment on this and other items.<br><br>
The Minister and I have had debates in the House and correspondence about the substance of the amendment, which would not be necessary but for a system that will be operated with financial restrictions for local government on both revenue and capital. The amendment would separate passenger transport authorities in relation to receipt of their standard spending assessment and, subsequently, the grant that goes with it. Obviously, that would establish a particular standard spending assessment for public transport which does not exist. The problem is that it is part of the other services bloc.<br><br>
Public transport is treated as part of the other services bloc, along with libraries and refuse collection, which are quite different from road building and maintenance which is treated as a separate item. That results in a number of anomalies which is best illustrated by the South Yorkshire rapid transit project, Nowhere else in Europe or the rest of the world would the four metropolitan district councils making up the passenger transport authority area be capped for the revenue consequences of preparation for the installation of a rapid transit system.<br><br>
The Department of Transport is prepared to offer the substantial grant available under section 56 for capital investment and to pick up the revenue consequences of preparation, but at a later date. That results in the district authorities finding themselves under threat of capping, because they happen to be spending more than their standard assessment on key services such as education and social services. Sheffield is spending £4 million more than the revised SSA on social services. That was supposed to be increased by 23 per cent, to take account of the fact that current spending was way above the Government's previous prediction, yet Sheffield has had to cut its social services even to get down to the £58 million that it is currently spending.<br><br>
The position is worse for the other districts in South Yorkshire because the rapid transit system applies only within the Sheffield boundary, the major conurbation in South Yorkshire. Nowhere else in the world would there be a capping regime that imposed a restriction on expenditure on a trading activity such as a rapid transit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0449">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 777</span>
system, on which another Department was willing to pay grant and which would yield revenue once it was up and running, or up and riding, as in this case.<br><br>
The absurd situation is that there is no separate standard spending assessment formula for public transport. Because it is seen as part of the other services block, because capping is imposed on authorities that exceed the Government's SSA, because gearing applies, with the domestic poll tax payer having to pick up the entire bill, and because authorities face the impossible choice of cutting other services to fund a scheme that is agreed to be acceptable and desirable and is to be funded by the Department of Transport, passenger transport authorities end up by having to seek a separate assessment and grant formula to get round an unacceptable and unworkable system. That is the reason for the amendment. We propose it not as the ultimate solution, but as a way out of the system.<br><br>
Nowhere else in the world would roads be treated specially and separately from public transport, which has led to over-investment in one area and under-investment in another. The Secretary of State for Transport in England, who formerly inflicted his values and views on Scotland, says that he is in favour of public transport, but the Department of the Environment takes action to ensure that whatever his will may be, it is not implemented. We believe that the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment do not see eye to eye on the matter but, as the Minister of State once said to me, there must be a hard man left in the Government. Once the hard woman had left, there had to be at least one hard man.<br><br>
The belated amendment to the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which brought about the situation that we are trying to reverse, has inflicted on the people of South Yorkshire the nonsense that I have described. Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster residents have their services cut to fund the preparation of a scheme that serves only Sheffield, that is backed by the Department of Transport, that will receive grant, but which at present puts everyone in conflict with one another and leaves the people of the area totally bewildered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) explained quickly but succinctly the purpose of the amendment, which is to treat, as in previous years, PTAs in the same way as the metropolitan police, and fire and civil defence authorities. They are precepting authorities which can set their level of resources for the ensuing financial year to develop the capital and revenue aspects of services. It is a tragedy that, since the Government changed the way in which SSAs are calculated for public transport, the allocation of resources for PTAs is not even across the metropolitan district councils. Consequently, the Government fail to encourage investment in public transport in such areas.<br><br>
As I understand it—perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—the SSA comprises three elements. First, there are capital financing arrangements. Secondly, there is what I call section 20 resourcing, which is for rail services that have a public subsidy, either individually or jointly with British Rail, separate from BR's financial limits that are set by the Department of Transport. The third element, which also relates to the amendment of my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 778</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Brightside, is subsumed within the blocks of SSA for other services distributed to metropolitan district councils.<br><br>
At a time when investment in public transport is widely supported by the electorate, irrespective of party political views, metropolitan local authorities are under pressure to provide sufficient resources for public transport. The amendment would establish a single, separate SSA for public transport. The current system does not offer any guidance to metropolitan district councils to determine the appropriate sum for public transport. Perhaps, that is the Government's deliberate policy. The distortion created by the arrangements is unacceptable. Greater Manchester passenger transport authority has studied SSAs for several district councils. It found that SSAs for public transport differ widely. In 1991–92, the figures ranged from £42·2 a head in a borough of Wigan that is in my constituency, to £56·58 in Manchester. In contrast, the PTAs levied £56·49 a head, which is acceptable in Manchester, as it had been allocated a nominal £56·58 within its SSA. However, Wigan is £16·32 below its nominal SSA. If Wigan is to make up that difference, as was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside, it will have to consider reducing resources for libraries and refuse collection, or be capped, as it was last year.<br><br>
Obviously, the result of such pressure on individual districts is a reduction in overall resources available to PTAs, so authorities are unable to develop their transport systems. It also leads to capital cuts in bus and rail services, as is happening in my constituency. The alternative is that council tax payers will have to meet the cost of capital projects inside and outside their local area. That will create a fissure between the PTAs and the metropolitan districts.<br><br>
A single system is needed in which PTAs assess and provide for the needs of a whole county. The Secretary of State should consider our proposals. I do not believe that the Department of Transport considers that the current arrangements will develop an effective transport system for metropolitan areas.<br><br>
I do not believe that the Department see any equity in the way in which the grant is distributed.<br><br>
11.45 pm<br><br>
It is left to districts, which have other pressures and other funding proposals through SSAs, to determine the overall objectives of the passenger transport authority. The 10 districts working separately would be unable to do that because it is their responsibility to determine the level of their budgets and not the overall budget for the passenger transport authority. It is vital for the Secretary of State to consider the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside.<br><br>
Greater Manchester is already considering major cuts in expenditure involving concessionary fares, school services, works services, services to highly populated areas, and evening and Sunday services. The Government have increased the external financing limits for British Rail, but no appropriate arrangements are made in section 20 on funding for PTAs. Many of the PTAs have had a dramatic reduction in resources for rail links within county boundaries. That is leading to pressure on PTAs to reduce funding for rail facilities whose revenue falls well below operating costs. In Oldham, Wigan, Atherton and other parts of the county, pressure is being put on the passenger transport authority to reduce or to eliminate services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0450">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 779</span>
because of the way in which PTAs are currently funded. The Government have failed to provide a significant increase in revenue.<br><br>
If the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority and executive are this year to reduce by £2 million the current bus network, which is valued at about £9·6 million, they must consider certain expenditure cuts. Reductions being considered are a 22 per cent, cut in school services, a 38 per cent, cut in works services, a 17 per cent, cut in early-morning services, a 24 per cent, cut in some services that operate all day in different districts, a 7 per cent, cut in peak-only buses, a 21 per cent, cut in shopping buses, a 13 per cent, cut in buses that operate in the evening, a 7 per cent, cut in buses that operate exclusively on Sundays, and an 11 per cent, cut on night routes. Those cuts are across the board in most districts in Greater Manchester.<br><br>
The way in which resources to the PTA are currently calculated is totally unacceptable. When the public want an expansion of and improvement in services, the PTA has to contemplate such significant cuts in services. The authority has not yet made its final decision about services. I am prepared to predict that the hon. Members for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) and for Bury, South (Mr. Sumberg), our colleagues in Bolton, and my colleagues in the Wigan metropolitan borough council will see significant cuts in services in their areas. We are at the western, most extreme, end of the county, and many of our services rely on subsidy. Any reduction of resources, either because the district council is unable to provide sufficient resources or because the Government have failed to meet requirements for rail services, will ultimately mean that services requiring additional revenue support will be the first to be cut.<br><br>
We are talking about not only day services but school services, services that affect the elderly, evening services, which are especially needed by women, and works services when we are trying to expand our local economies. That is not an abstract problem. It involves practical, daily matters affecting passenger transport authorities in Greater Manchester, south Yorkshire and other areas. That problem arose because the Government changed the way in which grant is calculated.<br><br>
If the Government cannot accept the amendment, I hope that they will consider making changes to the regulations to permit passenger transport authorities to become again their own precepting authorities, capable of providing services on a county-wide basis. Funding will then come from one source and will not be liable for reductions because of pressures on districts to cut their SSAs and budgets to avoid capping. Such a single-tier levying system will provide the necessary capital investment to continue phase II of Metrolink, phase I of which runs through the constituency of the hon. Member for Bury, North. My constituents will continue to pay for that and for the Manchester rail link. However, they are not prepared to accept a major erosion of their local services because of the way in which the PTA is currently funded.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will take those points seriously and that we shall not have to return to Marsham street in a few months for a cosy chitchat in his office, and rub our hands, comment on how awful it is, and say that something must be done. We have a practical problem, not a party political issue, about how to guide funds to the passenger transport authority, which I believe to be just as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 780</span>
important as the police and fire and civil defence authorities, and should be treated in the same way when calculating grant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise that I do not believe that this is a party political matter. I have been a strong supporter of Metrolink and Supertram and feel a sense of paternity for both projects because I was the Minister for Public Transport when they were coming to fruition. There is more than one way to consider those issues, and in that respect I want to talk about Supertram. In doing so I shall say things that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) knows already.<br><br>
Supertram involves a cost of £240 million, part of which is met by section 56 grant. For the remainder, the authorities in the PTA area are given supplementary credit approvals, enabling the costs in the first instance to be financed by borrowing. The loan charges on that borrowing are split into two categories. First, the non-trading element—the part that it is not foreseen can be recouped through the trading profits of Supertram—is paid for by the constituent districts that receive increases in their SSAs to match those payments. Therefore, the districts receive RSG to meet those loan charges.<br><br>
The second category is the trading element, the part that will eventually be recouped from the profitability of the system. We went out of our way to make a change to help authorties by saying that the interest on the trading element of the borrowing could be capitalised, or rolled up, so that in the long term those costs will be met from future receipts from the sale and operation of Supertram. Meanwhile, they are treated as a capital item.<br><br>
The overall effect of the funding of Supertram is that in the long term the authorities will gain a major asset worth £240 million at no cost to local taxpayers. In the short term, if the limited expenditure that they are asked to meet in the way that I have described occurs when they are spending above their SSAs, they are obliged to make choices. I emphasise that that difficulty arises only if authorities are spending above their standard spending assessments. The SSAs are actually increased for the non-trading element, as I have described. Therefore, the problem is entirely one of authorities spending above their SSAs. That is when they are forced to make choices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is fine in theory but the standard spending assessment calculation is different in all the districts, whether they are capped or not. There is a £16 difference between my authority's SSA and the average for Greater Manchester, which is £56. Where can my authority find the £16?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If SSAs for every district were not different, there would be no point in having SSAs. They are there to give different amounts of grant to different authorities. We try to define a standard level of service and to provide every authority with the opportunity to provide that service at a standard rate of community charge today and a standard level of council tax in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the principle of the speed link apply to other cities that wanted to introduce such a scheme? Would it apply to Leeds which wants to provide a similar service to those of Manchester and Sheffield?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not for me to say. The schemes under which Metrolink and Supertram are being developed are very different. It is not possible for me to make assumptions on behalf of my colleagues in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0451">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 781</span>
Department of Transport. The amendment proposes that we return to the system whereby the passenger transport authorities precept on the metropolitan districts. That would cause problems. It was difficult to establish a standard spending assessment for the PTAs. In three years out of four, they were automatically capped. It is not clear how accountability was achieved between precepting PTAs, the districts upon which they precepted and the electorate. There seems to be much greater accountability in the present system. Local authorities have to make difficult choices: if they choose to spend above their standard spending assessment, they must face the possibility of capping.<br><br>
The amendment would return to a precepting status for PTAs. That point is being made vigorously to my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Transport, and he is considering the representations. I remain to be convinced on the issue, and I must therefore urge that the amendment be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no accountability when the passenger transport authorities were capped for a period before the 1989 change. Clearly, there is no accountability now, because to choose between cutting education and social services and having a modern rapid transport system is no choice at all. It is the choice between a return to the horse and cart and teaching children to read and write. That is an insult to a modern, forward-looking, progressive Britain which is based on decentralisation of power and where decisions are made locally. Any other country in Europe would not have to put up with such nonsense. One could not imagine Bordeaux authorities being told that they could introduce a rapid transport system only if they cut education services to the level of those in Lille or around the Champs Elyśees. That suggestion is so silly that no one in his right mind would put it forward. We have to come to the conclusion that Ministers must be out of their minds.</span></p>
