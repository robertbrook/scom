<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 8, line 11, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(aa) he shall give that person a statement of the reasons for the modifications;'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is virtually self-explanatory, so I shall be extremely brief. It would ensure that people who comment on modifications to a proposal were aware of the reasons for them. It is sensible and eminently reasonable although, in the great volume of papers before him the Minister will probably find many reasons why the Government do not regard it as such. I shall eagerly await the Minister's comments on this progressive and helpful proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the brevity with which the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) moved the amendment, I shall respond similarly.<br><br>
The intentions of the amendment are undoubtedly worthy, but I am not convinced that it is necessary to deal with the matter in the Bill.<br><br>
Modifications will arise usually as a result of argument at the public inquiry, so often all the relevant parties will be aware of the issues: clause 13(3) makes sure that they are. It is only common sense that the Secretary of State should explain the reasons for his proposal to people who are likely to be affected by a modification. Not to do so would mean that they would come back to him asking for more information which would cause unwelcome and unnecessary delay. It is simply administrative good practice.<br><br>
The amendment is unnecessary because clause 13(3) envisages that the Secretary of State will announce that he is is minded to make an order but that a modification is desirable. Clause 14 more or less forces him to give reasons for his intentions to make the order and it is unthinkable that he would not give reasons for a proposed modification.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears from the Minister's explanation that the purpose of the amendment will be met, but if it is unthinkable for a Secretary of State not to give reasons for a proposed modification surely it would be sensible to enshrine that unthinkability in the Bill. Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that that is the intention of clause 14 and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett<span class='memberconstituency'> (Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 8, line 16, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(d) no Order varying the recommendation of the inquiry shall be made unless such Order has been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the crucial question of the sovereignty of Parliament as opposed to the powers of the Secretary of State*and a public inquiry.<br><br>
In their consultation document, the Government proposed that issues of national significance—those with which Parliament should deal—should go before a public inquiry. Parliament would then put its seal of approval or disapproval on the scheme. I understand that various groups have told the Government that the public inquiry procedure might be brought into disrepute if a public inquiry were held and recommended that a scheme should go ahead and then Parliament turned it down. I realise that is difficult to decide who should have the final say— Parliament, or the public inquiry and the Minister—so, I am not complaining that the Government have decided that Parliament should approve the principle, that an inquiry should follow, the inspector makes a recommendation on the basis of the outcome of the inquiry and the Secretary of State then signs the order.<br><br>
If Parliament agrees the principle and the inquiry and the Minister approve it, that is straightforward, but what would happen if the inquiry reached a conclusion different from that of the Minister? The opportunity should exist for Parliament to have a further say. I accept that that could be difficult.<br><br>
An inspector might say that a scheme was good, but required one or two minor modifications. The Secretary of State may examine and perhaps reject the modifications, or suggest slightly different ones. I accept that those modifications might not affect the overall principle and would not, therefore, need to be considered by Parliament, but sometimes the differences between the inspector and the Secretary of State could be substantial. A means of giving Parliament a final say in such cases should be built into the mechanism. In those cases, the scheme will be different from the one that Parliament originally approved.<br><br>
Amendment No. 31 draws the Government's attention to the difficulty that would arise when variations to the decision made by Parliament occurred in the inspector's report. I understand that the Minister would not wish to come back to Parliament with a minor variation from the original scheme. It is difficult to draft an amendment that would pick out a significant change rather than a minor variation. However, that does not mean that it would be impossible for parliamentary draftsmen to find a solution.<br><br>
Where the Secretary of State reaches a totally different decision from the inspector, it is essential that Parliament has a second chance to deal with the matter. It would be absurd if Parliament approved a scheme, the inquiry presented detailed evidence, the inspector recommended that the scheme should not go ahead because of detailed problems but the Secretary of State approved it without giving Parliament the opportunity to reconsider it in the light of the objections presented at the inquiry and highlighted in the inspector's report. If the Secretary of State reverses the inquiry's decision, Parliament should have the opportunity to have another go at the matter. Such cases will seldom occur.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0731">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
It is important that Parliament should have an opportunity to reconsider the scheme if the inspector makes substantial recommendations that the Secretary of State decides to ignore.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment and give a more specific undertaking that he accepts the problem and that the Department will search for an effective solution to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I met the hon. Gentleman last year to discuss his proposal for referring decisions to Parliament for confirmation, it was in the context of schemes of national significance. He proposed that that should happen only when the Secretary of State decided to make an order for a scheme of national significance, which Parliament had endorsed, but which the inspector at the public inquiry had recommended should be refused.<br><br>
I appear to have convinced the hon. Gentleman that those circumstances are likely to occur so infrequently that, in practice, that proposal would serve little purpose. It would be rather improbable that, where Parliament had endorsed a scheme of national significance, such as a major new railway line, the inspector at the inquiry would reject it outright. He might recommend alterations to its alignment, or he might call for the provision of more environmental works, but even rejection of such recommendations by the Secretary of State would not trigger the requirement to refer the decision to Parliament.<br><br>
The implications of the hon. Member's original proposal, rather than its relevance, give me greater cause for anxiety. Amendment No. 31 gives rise to similar considerations, but by expanding the scope of the proposal the hon. Gentleman has, unfortunately, magnified the problems that I saw in his original suggestion. Under the amendment, the Secretary of State would be required to refer to Parliament any order that he decided to make when his decision was, apparently, a departure from the recommendation of an inspector. That is probably not the intention of the amendment, but that is what it would mean.<br><br>
I accept that the hon. Gentleman is probing the issue and not asking for detailed explanations. However, I am worried that the amendment would be likely to increase significantly the degree to which Parliament would become involved in the new procedure. That would clearly defeat the object of our reforms.<br><br>
A second undesirable effect of the amendment is that it would give the inspector a status equal to that of the Secretary of State and would give Parliament an arbitrating role. That is different from the normal relationship between them. The inspector is appointed by the Secretary of State as an independent adviser to examine the detailed effects of a proposal and to make recommendations. Although the inspector may properly consider not only the local effects of a proposal but regional and national ones, it is the responsibility of the Secretary of State to fix the national policies within which proposals are considered.<br><br>
The implication of the amendment is that the inspector would have to consider the merits of national policy at inquiries because it would be within his power to question those policies in his report to the Secretary of State and to invite Parliament to support his view rather than the Secretary of State's.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
The amendment would also fall foul of the objection that the Council on Tribunals made to our original proposals for schemes of national significance when we proposed a role for Parliament in confirming the Secretary of State's decision at the end of the procedure. The council considered that such an arrangement would be likely to undermine the public inquiry system. It would mean that the final decision on matters of local detail, which had been examined at length at inquiry and by the Secretary of State, would be made after a single debate on the Floor of each House, without those affected by the decision having a chance to put their case to Parliament. That could result, for example, in decisions being made that were not based fully on the arguments advanced at the inquiry and the efforts of applicants or objectors could prove to have been wasted.<br><br>
Some of the hon. Gentleman's points have promoted us to think further about the position when, with a scheme of national significance that has received parliamentary endorsement in principle, the Secretary of State subsequently decided—for perfectly respectable and sensible reasons—that he wanted to make an order that slightly conflicted with the terms of the resolution. As the Bill stands, it would be necessary to start the whole process again, even if there were general agreement that that was unnecessary. We are therefore thinking about an amendment that would enable the Secretary of State to go back to Parliament to obtain approval for modified resolutions. He would then be able to make the order, having, of course, first consulted the people affected by the change and given them the opportunity to make representations to him. That might, as with any modification of an order, result in the need to reopen the inquiry. If we conclude that an amendment on those lines is needed, we shall table it in due course. I should explain that no firm decision has been made, but we are considering the matter closely. If we decide that a change is necessary, we shall make it before Report.<br><br>
I hope that that assures the hon. Gentleman that we accept his anxiety. We must find the best way in which to frame the matter so that there are no unnecessary delays and so that Parliament can reach a conclusion that if, after all the processes have been completed, there are good reasons for making a change that is perhaps inconsistent with its resolution, it is possible to come back to Parliament. That would probably be done after the inquiry has taken place and the people affected have been consulted properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last point is helpful, but I want to know—I suspect that the Minister also does—a little more about how that would work. I am worried that the Minister said that it would be unlikely that an inspector would object to a scheme that Parliament had approved of. That is unfair on the petitioners. They should feel, at least at the outset, that the inspector is neutral. As I understand the Minister's speech, he would expect the inspector to take into account the fact that Parliament had approved a scheme.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. I did not mean to give the impression that once Parliament had made a decision, the inspector had no further locus. I chose my words carefully. I said that it would be improbable that, where Parliament had endorsed a scheme of national significance, such as a major new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0732">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
railway line, the inspector at the inquiry would reject it outright. I am not saying that changes would not be made, but that it would be improbable that the inspector would reject a scheme that Parliament had approved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better not pick out examples from what has happened about the channel tunnel railway. Parliament gave approval to a channel tunnel and a railway line to link it. Significant changes have taken place.<br><br>
We must not shackle the inspector. Hon. Members consider the broad principle of a scheme on the basis of information that is different from that available to the inquiry. On clause 10,1 said that part of the argument for a public inquiry is to test the experts. When I receive a briefing on a project, I do not consider that I can give it professional scrutiny. I can look for weaknesses in it, but I do not have the resources to find out whether noise assessments and other details are accurate. I am reluctant to say so, but sometimes the skills of the lobbyists persuade Members of Parliament to vote in a certain way.<br><br>
Parliament may narrowly approve a scheme by 127 votes to 126. The first expert witness at the public inquiry on behalf of the promoters may make it clear that they have not thoroughly done their homework. A series of problems may then surface which convince the inspector that the scheme is unsound.<br><br>
What does the Secretary of State do then? He has to arbitrate between Parliament, which has given its approval —perhaps with some members of the Secretary of State's party lobbying strongly in favour of a scheme—and the inspector, who has given the thumbs down because of insuperable technical problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing<span class='memberconstituency'> (Newham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not my hon. Friend outlining a problem that we seem to have in adopting a common-sense procedure? If a Committee considering a private Bill finds that a scheme is not feasible, it can dispose of the Bill and tell the promoters to start again. If Parliament does not endorse a scheme because it is a local one, the inspector, having been given the drafty has to go ahead willy nilly. Is that not so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I would have thought that the scheme could be dropped and another brought forward. There is not that much of a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who decides?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be the Secretary of State, but it would be fairly easy and much of this is done informally. If someone presenting a scheme runs into problems at the inquiry and realises that to get it through he must make substantial modifications, he can say to the inspector that he wants to stop the process and come back with a new set of proposals. With a parliamentary Bill, he would not have to wait 12 months to do so, but could present a new set of proposals relatively quickly—although obviously, the statutory notices would have to be given. I should have thought that it was possible to design a similar procedure.<br><br>
On schemes of national significance in which Parliament has a role, I want to ensure that where there is conflict between the inspector and the Secretary of State, Parliament looks at matters again. The Minister says that such conflict is unlikely, but with all the arguments about the channel tunnel substantial problems are likely to emerge. Some of the estuary schemes will be of national significance and will be the subject of fiercely fought battles.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
The public inquiry stage should be given reasonable prominence. Those presenting a scheme should realise at the beginning of an inquiry that although Parliament has approved it, if sufficient problems arise the inspectors are entitled to turn it down. Equally, we should not have to mandate the Secretary of State merely to endorse what emerges from the inquiry. Ultimately, he makes a political judgment, and I accept that. However, Parliament should be entitled at that stage to have another look at the scheme if the Secretary of State has overruled the inspector's recommendation. That is not something that will happen only rarely; it is a real possibility. Although I welcome the Minister's consideration of a way in which modifications can be dealt with, I hope that he will also look at whether Parliament can have a final say.<br><br>
The Minister said that such a situation would arise very rarely. If he is right, I suppose that we would be taking up the parliamentary draftsmen's time on drawing up a safety net that would not have very much effect. However, it would reassure people outside that a procedure for dealing with such a situation existed. Even if the Minister is correct, such a provision would not cause a major problem in the procedure. If it is believed to be unfair that a scheme should be turned down by an inspector when the Secretary of State still wants to approve it, we would have already given to Parliament the final right to decide whether, despite all the discussions that had taken place since it originally gave its approval, it wanted the scheme to proceed or not.<br><br>
I hope that between now and Report the Minister will reconsider not only the modifications but the principle involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point. I will obviously consider this in the light of the other matters that I have undertaken to consider. I have tried to explain some of the difficulties that we face. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point; I do not know whether it will be practical to accept his proposal, but we are looking at the position and I shall consider whether we can accommodate it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful reply, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

CONCURRENT PROCEEDINGS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 82, in page 9, line 18, leave out subsection (2).<br><br>
I advise the Committee that I will not be moving amendment No. 83, which is next on the selection list. That may help the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), whose amendments follow that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 82 seeks to delete subsection (2), rather than the entire clause, because I accept that we need to consider that clause and that it is probably necessary. There is a complex series of Acts, statutory instruments and regulations. Anyone wishing to start works and gain powers, which might previously have been done by means of a private Bill, must make an application under rules laid down by the Secretary of State. The application is in the form of a draft statutory instrument which may cover a wide range of matters and would, in effect, be similar to a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
Bill under the present procedure. It will cover works, powers and amendments to any other Act. Presumably, statutory instruments will emanate from that Act and need adjustment if the draft statutory instrument is ultimately approved.<br><br>
The notes on clauses state that the purpose of the clause is to provide a procedure, where that is appropriate, for concurrent inquiries into other matters that may arise because of the amendment of other Acts and the practices and statutory instruments that will follow.<br><br>
Paragraph (2) of the notes on clauses states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Joint Committee recommended in their report that orders under the new procedure should be capable of securing for the promoter all that he could have secured by means of a private Bill."</p></blockquote>
That is a controversial but desirable objective. We are considering the statutory means towards that end.<br><br>
When I first read clause 15—without the benefit of the notes on clauses—I was lost. I defy anyone without a good working knowledge of those notes or an idea of what the clause is about to understand what it means. I have been a Member of Parliament for more years than I care to think about and I am one of those relatively unusual hon. Members who says, in Committee, that elected Members have a duty to ensure that the statue is reasonably clear. A few years ago, a Committee was set up to review the drafting of legislation. The Chairman of that Committee was a former Member for Huntingdonshire, now Lord Renton. Alas, that report did not receive much attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'> My hon. Friend rightly says that it was ignored.<br><br>
Soon after I came to the House, I tabled an amendment to replace an existing clause, which I made fun of because it reminded me of the Gilbertian song that goes, "A is happy, B is not", as it went into extraordinary contortions.<br><br>
I want the Minister to state briefly and clearly the purpose of clause 15, especially subsection (2). First, the wording that refers to existing or preceeding provisions is extraordinarily complex and does not spell out their functions. I should have thought that the parliamentary draftsmen could have specified those functions without going too far outside the rules, so that people could have some sort of a clue about what is meant.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Secondly—and I make no complaint about the technical drafting—the subsection could spawn the powers to make regulations governing how this very complex clause should be implemented. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish has spoken about matters of national importance, but in matters of local importance we could also be faced with an enormous range of regulations, statutory instruments and rules. The Minister has kindly published some of those rules, and I presume that they will have statutory force. They will be subject to parliamentary debate, but my mind boggles at the variability and complication that will arise from different orders being made at different times by different Secretaries of State.<br><br>
What we need is a diagram, along the lines of the old block schematics for wireless sets, to describe how the clause fits in among the huge range of the Bill's regulations and orders. Such a document would have no statutory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
weight, but it would help hon. Members to unwrap the sometimes complicated procedure of a private Bill Committee. That procedure cannot be made simple, but at least it is ensconced in one set of parliamentary orders and one consolidated proposal. A private Member's Bill contains everything in one volume and can be amended. Moreover, as I said in my intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, the procedure of such a Bill is under the judicial control of a group of Members of Parliament, who also determine its destiny.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend said, and as experience of private legislation shows, private Bill Committees very often proceed by allowing petitioner and applicant to reach agreement in accordance with what the Committee has indicated would be acceptable. That complex process is carried out outside the House at the discretion and behest of the Committee and its Chair. The same process will have to take place under the procedure outlined in the Bill, as my hon. Friend noted, but the Committee's role will fall to the inspector alone, with or without consultation with the Minister.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will put on record his understanding of clause 15, for the benefit of those who turn to the report of the Committee's proceedings to understand what has been discussed. However, I fear that understanding this clause will be a difficult job for anyone who reads the nine paragraphs of explanatory notes, but who has not been involved in drafting the Bill, in consultations about it for some weeks or months beforehand, or has not been a member of the Committee.<br><br>
I am not content to allow measures to pass through this House and through clause stand part debates in a Committee of which I am a member, without some attempt being made—perhaps not now, but before the Bill goes to another place—to spell out the provisions of its clauses in a way that any reasonably well-informed citizen, who knows something about the Bill, would understand. I do not wish to push that point too much. I hope that it is a completely non-party and thoroughly parliamentary point and that it will be considered. I make no complaint about the purpose of the clause and the powers for which it provides, but it could be presented in a clearer, more coherent and more understandable way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall consider the point he raised about the way in which guidance should be used. We may indeed follow his recommendation and produce a flow chart to illustrate the procedure. We want to consider the best way of enabling people to understand it. It is in nobody's interest to make procedures complicated or unnecessarily difficult to understand. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his suggestion.<br><br>
The purpose of the clause is to enable the Secretary of State to ensure that, where consent is required for something in parallel with an order, the statutory processes can be made to work together. In particular, we were considering railway closures. There are occasions when railway works entail the closure of other parts of the railway and consent has been obtained by private Bill. The procedures in the 1962 Act are very different to those we intend in the Bill because their aim is different. The 1962 Act does not envisage that one railway might replace another, so we must make it clear how British Rail or London Regional Transport and the Transport Users

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
Consultative Committees are to proceed. We have already had discussions with the Central Transport Advisory Committee. We have already aired the question of waterway closures. The Committee will know that we have met waterways interest groups about waterway closures and have promised to consider an amendment.<br><br>
It is not our intention that either of the closures should receive consent in the order under clause 1 or clause 3, although it must be possible to authorise the works which give effect to consents, once given. We want to ensure a parallel process, which is efficient but which preserves the essential elements of the present procedure.<br><br>
We shall need to discuss with the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council and others similar issues on the adaptation of schedule 3 of the Transport Act 1968. But, for example, the objection period in that case is 28 days, whereas we intend to make the objection period for works orders 42 days. The inquiry procedure laid down in section 158 of that Act dates from 1919 and we want to use section 250 of the Local Government Act 1972, which provides for inquiries, in the Bill. Those are all technical changes that would not adversely affect the rights of the parties. However, further examination of those matters led us to conclude that the drafting may be defective in that it refers only to "proceedings" and not to the procedures which lead to them. Therefore, we may propose an amendment on Report.<br><br>
There are other consents that are more closely related to works. We have already discussed footpaths and roads. Since the procedures affecting them are so close to those in the Bill, we think it sensible to include them in orders if there is a genuine connection. I have already undertaken to consider an amendment that could eliminate the improper use of orders.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Newham, South for the points that he raised. I hope that I have answered them in my speech and I shall consider what he said about the way in which the information should be presented.</span></p>

TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate<span class='memberconstituency'> (Faversham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 9, leave out lines 38 to 42 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>
<ul>
<li>'(2A) Subject to subsections (2B) and (2C), planning permission shall be deemed to be granted for the development for which provision is made by an order under section 1 or 3 of the Transport and Works Act 1992.</li>

<li>in any other case the district planning authority.'.</li>
</ol></ul></p></blockquote>
The clause enables the Secretary of State to direct that planning permission be deemed to be granted for any development that has been approved by an order and for the blight provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to apply to lands that are acquired or proposed to be acquired. Clause 16(1) will empower the Secretary of State, on making an order under clauses 1 or 3—which include provision for development—to direct that planning permission for that development shall be deemed to be granted, subject to such conditions, if any, as he may specify. The matter of whether or not that permission should be granted—and if so, on what terms—is left entirely to the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that that is in contrast with the planning rules, which apply to development authorised by Acts of Parliament, including private Acts, or harbour revision orders.<br><br>
Under part II of schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1988, planning permission for development that is authorised by an Act of Parliament or by a harbour revision order is automatically deemed to be granted, subject to certain safeguards set out in part II. As the amendment is in the same terms as part II of that schedule, it provides that once an order under clauses 1 or 3 is made, the development for which the order provides would have the benefit of deemed planning permission in the same way as a development authorised by an Act of Parliament or by a harbour revision order.<br><br>
The point is narrow but significant. It is logical to place the planning rules for developments authorised under the Bill on the same basis as planning provision for harbour revision orders. The matter has been brought to the attention of the House by the British Railways Board and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment is eminently sensible. It was not only the British Railways Board which expressed its concern about the change in the planning laws that the Bill will bring about—in a letter to you, Mr. Latham, the Chartered Institute of Transport earlier this week expressed similar fears. At present, when a development is authorised by an Act of Parliament, planning permission is deemed to be granted, subject to certain safeguards. The Bill makes that the responsibility of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I know that the Minister's admiration for the Secretary of State is unbounded, as one would expect, but he was unwise enough to say at our previous sitting that in certain planning matters "a Secretary of State knows best". However, Secretaries of State come and go, as do Governments. By giving the Secretary of State the responsibility the clause gives considerable scope for delay.<br><br>
Some bodies that have made representations to members of the Committee believe that considerable expense and delay may result if the Secretary of State, for any reason, decides to sit on an application. I know that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
the Minister will say that that is unlikely, but I hope that he will forgive me for saying that 13 years in Opposition breed cynicism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton<span class='memberconstituency'> (Tatton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a long way to go yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn on that.<br><br>
The fact that fears have been expressed and that further delay and expense may be incurred if the Secretary of State delays his decision should worry the Committee. If the Minister accepts the amendment, it would go a great way to meet those fears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham for explaining his amendment. I understand that the promoters want to be sure that when they obtain an order, any necessary planning permission will go with it.<br><br>
We considered carefully whether to extend to these orders the scope of part II of schedule 2 of the 1988 general development order. However, we concluded that planning merit should be considered on a case-by-case basis. That will enable the necessary planning conditions attached to the order to be tailored to suit a particular case, rather than planning permission automatically being deemed to be granted, subject to standard conditions applying across the board.<br><br>
For example, a draft order might include design details of a building or bridge, which the Secretary of State would be able to approve rather than leaving them for subsequent approval by the local planning authority. That might be welcomed by applicants because it should save time. Another reason for adopting a case-by-case approach is that planning permission will not be required for some of the orders—it may already have been granted.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The rules about applications under clause 6 will be drafted so that the applicant can make clear whether he needs planning permission. He will need a certificate from the local planning authority about the planning position, including anything relevant from the structural or local plan. For development schemes requiring planning permission, consideration of the planning merit of the proposals is likely to be an important aspect of the approval process. It will therefore usually follow that if the Secretary of State were satisfied that an order should be approved he would, in coming to that conclusion, have satisfied himself that planning permission should be granted. Even if the amendment were accepted, the Secretary of State would still be obliged to consider the planning merits before determing the order. The amendment offers no advantage over the approach in clause 16. It would have the disbenefit of a loss of flexibility in setting the conditions appropriate to a particular case.<br><br>
I hope that my explanation has allayed some of the anxieties expressed and that my hon. Friend is reassured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point may be more appropriate to the clause stand part debate, but as it is also relevant to the amendment I shall raise it now.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain how the clause affects blight? There was an unfortunate example in my constituency—it related to the planning mechanism, but it could apply to a Bill. A constituent of mine was in the process of selling his house and had a completion date towards the end of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
week. On the Monday of that week, the person buying his house told him that the sale was off because that day the local authority announced that, in conjunction with British Rail, it was considering a freight terminal nearby and the house would be on the route of the access road.<br><br>
Eventually, British Rail decided that the terminal would be at Trafford park, rather than Guide bridge, but for about three months the man's house was blighted and the sale fell through. I am pursuing the matter, but as I understand the present position, he will have no compensation. He has been told, firmly, that as the scheme did not go ahead his house is not blighted, and that therefore he is not entitled to compensation. That man lost his sale and the opportunity to buy another house. Although his house is not officially blighted, it is in the back of the mind of any would-be purchaser that if the local authority decided to open up the site for a freight terminal and needed a new road for access, it might affect the house.<br><br>
I have much sympathy for my constituent. I want to find out at what point in the process a property will become blighted and the individual involved entitled to compensation and to sell his house to the developers. Will it be when people give notice of their intention to go ahead with the scheme, or when the Government start the order-making process, or at the end of the process when approval has been granted—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish what I have to say and then the Minister can reply. Will he say exactly when the individual will know when the property will be legally blighted, what compensation he will be entitled to and from whom it will be obtained?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that his points might be more appropriate to the clause stand part debate as they relate specifically to clause 16(2). However, as he has made them in the proper way, I shall exercise commonsense discretion over what stage the Minister may choose to reply. He may choose to do so under this amendment, to which the hon. Gentleman's points are not directly relevant, or under clause stand part. I shall call the Minister at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his answers, but they did not deal with the legitimate points made in support of the amendment. They are technical and professional points that require further examination. Will my hon. Friend give an undertaking to return to the matter at a later stage?<br><br>
My hon. Friend made a case for the Secretary of State having discretion. In certain circumstances that could be helpful to applicants and to objectors, but that discretion does not exist with harbour revision orders or when Parliament has authorised development under a private Act. An element of doubt, flexibility and discretion is now being introduced which could delay matters or require further planning processes. That would not help many desirable developments.<br><br>
The amendment makes it clear that deemed planning permission can be granted only after the scheme has gone through certain planning processes. I hope that my hon. Friend appreciates that I am not suggesting a blank cheque. Deemed planning permission cannot be given unless the scheme has satisfied certain criteria, which includes obtaining local authority planning approval. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
admit that the local authority's flexibility is constrained. Nonetheless, whether the order has gone to public inquiry or has been subject to another procedure, the Secretary of State will ensure that normal planning criteria are met before deemed planning permission is given. We certainly do not assume that normal procedure can be brushed aside.<br><br>
There is a strong case for my amendment. I am not satisfied with my hon. Friend's answers and I consider that the matter requires further study. I should be grateful for my hon. Friend's further comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Member for Faversham. I understand the Minister's dilemma, but the philosophy behind the amendment is worthy of his Department's consideration.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Faversham pointed out that once an Act of Parliament is passed, any development would have the benefit of deemed planning permission. People are concerned about the long, built-in delays in Britain's planning procedures, especially on transport infrastructure. We do not want to create a further barrier in legislation that would cause even greater delay to some much-needed projects.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should not press his amendment to a Division, but he is right to pursue the matter. It is not for me to advise the Minister—many others do that—but he should reconsider the point. If he is unable to accept the amendment, the Opposition will return to it on Report. We can then clarify whether such an amendment is necessary and desirable. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that, if he cannot accept the amendment, we can return to the matter on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I have failed to give an adequate explanation of how the matter should be tackled, of course I shall reconsider it and examine the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East is right. I wish to do nothing to lengthen unduly the process of getting the works done. If there is a problem and the process could be unnecessarily lengthened, I shall reconsider the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham said that the matter was technical. I shall, therefore, go away and examine the matter carefully rather than give a commitment this morning in Committee.<br><br>
You have allowed flexibility in the discussion, Mr. Latham, and I wish, therefore, to deal with the questions asked by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett).<br><br>
Blight goes with the publication of draft orders, as is the procedure for other sorts of order. I am not an expert on compensation and I am relying on my notes. Compensation will be settled in the usual way, before the Lands Tribunal if necessary. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about blight and almost deemed blight. A development might attract not only actual blight, but the presumption that there might be blight. That happens often. It is sometimes difficult to reassure people that there is no blight when there is an underlying view to the contrary. I hope that my reply satisfies the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish about the technicalities of the rules and the arrangements for blight. I give my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham an undertaking to re-examine the matter.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that undertaking. My hon. Friend has a deserved reputation for always carrying out his undertakings thoroughly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause would, in effect, disapply part II of the Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 in regard to applications for orders under clauses 1 and 3. The provision is not intended to relax the important safeguards to our maritime environment set out in the Food and Environment Protection Act, but to streamline the process so that applicants for orders under clauses 1 and 3 need not apply to different Government Departments for a FEPA licence. We have concluded that the objective should be achieved, not by disapplying the whole of part II of the FEPA, but by treating the applications for an order as applications for a licence and taking matters from there. Therefore, on Report we shall introduce amendments to clause 15 which will deal with this matter more satisfactorily. Consequently, it will be helpful if members of the Committee do not agree to clause 19 standing part of the Bill. I shall be voting against it.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to vote against clauses in a Government Bill: it goes against all my instincts. I am not even sure that I have the permission of my Whip to vote against such an important clause. However, I am sure that I can do so with great enthusiasm.<br><br>
I had intended to speak to an amendment that I had tabled to the clause, but for some reason of which I am unaware, it has not been selected for debate. No doubt there are other ways of approaching the matter in this stand part debate and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear in mind what I am about to say when he reconsiders the issue.<br><br>
One thoroughly applauds the Minister's desire to streamline the process and ensure that one can have what is, in effect, a composite licence for matters authorised by orders under the Bill. That is a good objective which I think has wholehearted support. But if my hon. Friend intends so to streamline the procedures, should not that approach also be applied to matters authorised under the Harbours Act 1964 or harbour empowerment orders? The amendment which I tabled, but cannot comment on, proposes extending the exemptions to works authorised by harbour revision orders under section 14 of the Harbours
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
Act 1964 or harbour empowerment orders under section 16. A composite authorisation would therefore have been given under section 14 of the 1964 Act and there would have been no need to obtain a separate licence under part I of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 or a consent under section 34 of the Coast Protection Act 1949. As I understand it, that is my hon. Friend's objective with regard to matters approved through orders made under the Bill. Therefore, it is logical to extend those exemptions to matters dealt with under the harbours legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is likely that we shall wish to look again at the harbours legislation procedure when the Department of Trade and Industry has completed its current review under the deregulation initiative of the system of consent and licences relating to work in tidal waters and designated areas for the continental shelf, as stated by my hon. Friend the Minister for Corporate Affairs in a written reply on 18 December 1990. Therefore, I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham that we shall consider his proposal and possibly take it on board.<br><br>
I wondered whether I should rise and vote against the clause and plunge the Committee into turmoil, but I decided that perhaps an explanation would be the best way of facilitating the Committee's progress.</span></p>

POWER TO APPLY FOR, OR OBJECT TO, ORDERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I) beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 10, line 42, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>';and copies of such written objections shall also be deposited in the Library of the House of Commons'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment is intended to introduce a minor safeguard through providing information about any objections that are levied by requiring that copies of written objections shall also be deposited in the Library of the House.<br><br>
We have had an open system under which matters were taken on the Floor of the House. Many people said that it was a cumbersome system, which is why we are considering a Bill proposing alterations to it. We shall move to an internal system in which the Minister will have great powers. Members of Parliament and members of the public will not know the objections levied to orders made under clauses 1 and 3.<br><br>
The Bill will repeal the Light Railways Act 1986 and the Light Railways Act 1912. Therefore, transferring railways to an operating body, which would have been done under the Light Railways Acts, will now be done by an order made by the Minister. Clause 21(3) gives the British Railways Board, the British Waterways Board and London Regional Transport the power to object without interference by the Secretary of State. If I mention briefly the circumstances in which an objection to the transfer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
order to provide the Keighley and Worth Valley light railway with powers to operate the five miles of railway between Keighley and Oxenhope in 1967, that will show the Committee why it is good to deal with such matters out in the open, rather than behind closed doors.<br><br>
At that time, when the light railway order was made, we needed a transfer order to transfer the powers and obligations of running a railway from the British Railways Board to the Keighley and Worth Valley light railway Ltd. An objection was made by Keighley (West Yorkshire) Ltd., which was the bus company—members of the Committee may recall a similar occurrence with the "Titfield Thunderbolt". The bus company said that it would remove its objection only if trains did not stop at Haworth—the largest station and potentially the most important source of revenue—or if fares were charged for five years at the rate of roughly double the bus fares. To secure withdrawal of the objection, a five-year agreement was made. The bus company was simply protecting its interests and claimed that it had purchased six brand new double-deckers to cater for the passengers no longer travelling by rail. Such an arrangement should be made known.<br><br>
Objections could be valid, but they could be made by a larger body that was trying unfairly to use its advantage over a smaller body. The Secretary of State can make judgments on valid objections, but Members of Parliament and members of the public should have access to the information on which objections are based. That is a minor safeguard in the process of transferring the procedure for issuing authorisations from the external full glare of the Floor of the House, now televised, to an internal, departmental administrative system carried out by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, I hope that he can assure us that the objections will be made available so that we, as well as the Secretary of State, can make a judgment when we believe that an objection is unfair and needs the cold light of publicity to make that known.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand some of the hon. Gentleman's points; they were not clear when I first read the amendment. The purpose of clause 21 is just to ensure that bodies that have been empowered by statute to promote or oppose private Bills in Parliament will have a similar power in respect of orders under the new procedure. The amendment would introduce a provision that relates to the procedure for making an objection to a draft order.<br><br>
Even so, I fail to see what benefit would be gained by the amendment. The fact that an objection has been made by a statutory body such as a local authority, or by the British Railways Board, does not mean necessarily that the objection concerns matters of national importance in which Parliament should involve itself. Where the interests of those bodies are specially or directly affected by a proposal, clause 11 already provides special protection by giving them the right to insist on the holding of a public inquiry.<br><br>
The effect of the amendment would be that the Library could receive many objections of a purely local nature relating to proposals that at no stage in the procedure would come before Parliament for formal consideration. If the statutory bodies covered by the clause consider that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0738">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
their objections are of such weight as to deserve the attention of Members of Parliament, they are undoubtedly well versed in the art of lobbying.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bradford, South may say that he is concerned about all the objections made, not only about those from the statutory bodies. Most local people and bodies know how to make their Member of Parliament aware of their feelings and, in turn, that Member of Parliament will know how to bring the matter to public attention.<br><br>
Therefore, although what the hon. Member for Bradford, South is suggesting is well expressed, it is unnecessary. It would add to the complication of procedures that we are trying to simplify and I believe that people are already sufficiently able to make their objections known. I hope that the hon. Member will not feel that he must press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the amendment is designed to deal with objections which receive little publicity but which are simply communicated to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify this matter. The objections would not be communicated only to the Secretary of State, but to the promoter. They would also be made at a public inquiry. That should guarantee sufficient safeguards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even so, circumstances could arise in which a public inquiry might decide against a proposal and the promoter might decide that publicity would prejudice his position. That was the case in the example that I gave. We felt that publicity about the pressure from Keighley (West Yorkshire) Ltd. would not help us as it might be more to the company's advantage. We tried to co-operate as much as we could so that the objection might be withdrawn.<br><br>
The amendment was intended merely as an additional safeguard of a Member of Parliament's access to information, but in view of the Minister's comments, and of the fact that it would be difficult to prevent information about a controversial matter from being circulated, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

VALIDITY OF ORDERS UNDER SECTION I OR SECTION 3</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 11, line 39, after 'property', insert 'rights of interests'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 87, in page 11, line 40, leave out subsection (3).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause deals with the right of appeal and legal proceedings on applications under clauses 1 and 3. I wish to draw two matters to the Minister's attention, one of which I hope he will accept and the other I hope he will explain.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Subsection (2)(b) gives the grounds for quashing the order
<br><blockquote><p>"or any provision contained in it, either generally or in so far as it affects any property of the applicant."</p></blockquote>
Surely it is not only property. "Injurious affection", which is the locus standi of any petition under a private Bill, is certainly not confined to property: it never has been and I doubt whether any hon. Friend would want it to be. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
is prejudicial affection, in all its manifestations. If we leave the word "property" on its own, we shall greatly reduce the power of the courts in dealing with appeals against applications or against the validity of any orders so made. If "rights or interests" were inserted, as my amendment suggests, it would put appeals on an equal footing with petitioners' appeals against Bills. That may not go far enough, but at least it goes further than the Bill.<br><br>
A judge may express great sympathy with an applicant. He may be convinced that the applicant has a good case but have to say that the evidence shows that it does not relate to property. He may add that Parliament must have had a good reason for excluding other matters and as "property" is not the relevant description, he has to find in favour of the defendant.<br><br>
Amendment No. 87 affects a subject's liberty. The powers in subsection (3) appear in other legislation and I have questioned the reasons for them on other occasions. Subsection (3) is entirely related to liberty—the powers of the courts in applications against the validity of some orders. They are not Acts of Parliament: they are merely orders made by Ministers on behalf of the Crown and on behalf of us all.<br><br>
Subsection (3) begins:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsections (1) and (2) above".</p></blockquote>
But those two subsections are clearly restricted. Subsection (1)(a) states
<br><blockquote><p>"that it is not within the powers of this Act"</p></blockquote>
—that is all right—and subsection (l)(b) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"that any requirement imposed by or under this Act".</p></blockquote>
Although it is possible to question the validity of an order, it must accord with the qualifications of subsection (1). Subsection (3) says that
<br><blockquote><p>"an order under section 1 or 3 above shall not, either before or after it has been made, be questioned in any legal proceedings whatever."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand the reason for that—it restricts application to a court. Whatever injustice or grievance that a person feels—we cannot foresee what may arise—it would not even enter into the fists. If the ground for complaint were not proven under Clause 23 (1)(a) and (b), the complaint would not get far. There might be a judicial review to decide whether the complaint fell under paragraphs (a) or (b), but if it did not, the court would be bound to dismiss the application because, regardless of its merits, it had been ruled out and its validity could not be questioned in any legal proceedings, including a judicial review. The judge can only explain that Parliament ruled it out.<br><br>
If we pass legislation, we should be able to defend it. As we cannot do that personally, we must know the reasons for it. I look forward to the Minister's explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the hon. Gentleman's concern, in proposing amendment No. 86, that the courts should not be hampered in their task of defending the rights and interests of those who may be affected by schemes against improper use of the powers in the Bill. However, his fears about clause 23 are groundless. In legal terms, the word "property" does not refer only to the ownership of land, buildings and goods; it includes the ownership of rights and interests, such as the right to gain access to one's house across other people's land.<br><br>
Amendment No. 86 would, therefore, add nothing to the protection which is already afforded by clause 23.<br><br>
Opposition Members seem to fear that subsection (3) of the clause will unduly restrict the ability of those affected
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0739">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
by schemes to protect their interests against improper use of the powers that are to be conferred under the Bill. That fear is unjustified and amendment No. 87 would lead to serious problems for those seeking approval for schemes.<br><br>
There is nothing novel or sinister about subsection (3). As elsewhere in the Bill, an attempt is being made to place promoters in the same position as if they had secured an Act of Parliament. With an Act, promoters are able to go ahead with their works schemes confident that the validity of the Act will not be challenged. The purpose of subsection (3) is to ensure, that the processing of orders is not disrupted by endless litigation. The right time for anyone who is affected by proposals to assess whether something amiss has happened will, in almost every case, be once the decision has been made. It would be premature to try to do this before the Secretary of State had issued his decision letter and explained why he has reached a conclusion.<br><br>
Clause 23 seeks to ensure that any challenges to decisions are made within a reasonable time after the announcement of the decision. Without subsection (3), those whose proposals have been approved by the Secretary of State will be uncertain, perhaps for years, about whether they can start to implement their scheme without being challenged in the courts. That is clearly unfair, and no one would consider it desirable.<br><br>
The six-week period for challenging decisions is quite sufficient. Those who are likely to have grounds for challenging a decision will almost certainly have been involved in the proceedings leading up to the decision and will not need a long period to prepare their application to the High Court to test the validity of an order.<br><br>
The clause follows the Highways Act 1980, and an equivalent provision exists in the harbours legislation. I should clarify one point about the effect of the clause: although its purpose is to regulate challenges about the way in which the Secretary of State exercises his powers under the Bill, it will not rule out the possibility of successful legal challenge even after the end of the six-week period. The courts are much inclined to interpret clauses of this character very narrowly.<br><br>
As I have said, the aim of clause 23 is to provide some finality to procedures under the Bill. Amendment No. 87 would not only remove that finality, but would upset the careful balance in those procedures between the interests of applicants and objectors. I hope that my explanation has allayed the hon. Gentleman's fears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply.<br><br>
I noted with interest that the Minister used the phrase "rights and interests", which will appear in <i>Hansard.</i> He may be right to say that in legal terms "property" includes rights and interests, but that is news to me. It may be one of the quirks of legal phraseology. To a layperson, such as myself, it seems strange, because a material distinction can be drawn between property and rights and interests.<br><br>
To return to what I referred to as the Renton principles, if the Minister says that property includes rights and interests, let us put those two words in the Bill. What possible purpose can there be for excluding them? I hope that if I withdraw the amendment, the Minister will reflect on the issue before the Bill completes all its stages. He has almost convinced himself of the merits of the amendment with his own argument.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
As I now know the purpose of the subsection, I concede that a final measure must give the validity of an Act to a statutory instrument, but what a confession: a complex statutory instrument of 300 or 400 pages, with goodness knows how many schedules, will be upgraded as if it were an Act of Parliament because there is no other way to do it.<br><br>
The Minister explained that the purpose of the subsection is to give certainty to the promoters. That is another reason why we should scrutinise the whole procedure. Having given us an explanation of subsection 3, perhaps the Minister will undertake to include the grammatical and sensible phrase "rights or interests" in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I undertake to consider the points made by the hon. Member for Newham, South, but what he proposes already exists in the legal definition. However, if the hon. Gentleman feels that there is still a gaping hole, I shall check to ensure that it is closed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not be a legal gaping hole, but it is a hole as it affects the public who may, in the future age of tramways and railways, be surprised at the number of orders tabled. I thank the Minister for his remarks and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

Clause 24</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EXERCISE OF SECRETARY OF STATE'S FUNCTIONS BY APPOINTED PERSON</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 11, line 45, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>', providing that the person appointed is a Minister at the Department of Transport'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment examines the proposition in the Bill that the powers delegated by Parliament to the Minister to produce orders are delegated to another person to be appointed by the Minister. That is completely different from the usual procedure.<br><br>
When we discussed the matter at an earlier sitting, the Minister said that those people, who are not categorised in the clause, would be inspectors at inquiries instituted by the Secretary of State. If that is so, I do not understand why it cannot be in the Bill. The system to be adopted is different as inspectors carrying out public inquiries usually have not the power to make orders but the power and duty to make recommendations to the Secretary of State, who makes an order for a road or a side road, for example.<br><br>
Under the clause, the inspector is being given the status and power of the Secretary of State to make orders under sections 1 and 3. Sections 1 and 3 authorise the construction or operation of a transport system, the construction of an inland waterway, and the carrying out of various works. They are wide powers. I do not argue that we should not have that new system; I merely question whether an officer or person appointed by the Secretary of State—not necessarily an officer of the Department of Transport—should have the wide powers that Parliament is giving the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The amendment provides that the person appointed should be a Minister at the Department of Transport. Scattering Ministers to public inquiries in town halls across the land might cause the Department of Transport some problems, although the rest of us might not be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
terribly upset. However, I look forward to the Minister's response, as this is an unusual power. I know that we are embarking on a new system, but we should not do so by handing over powers to make orders to a person appointed by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
It is clear that the clause has reserve powers to ensure that the inspector may be sacked and replaced by someone else if he makes a mess of things. That is less than satisfactory. We should always be cautious about handing over the power to make binding law through orders. That caution should extend even to local authorities, which are democratically elected. We do hand over much power to them fairly frequently, although the powers are usually well denned and circumscribed. In contrast, clause 24 is specific in stating that the powers will be the same as those of the Secretary of State. Clause 24(3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person appointed under this section shall have in relation to the application—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) the same powers and duties as the Secretary of State has under sections 1 and 3 above".</p></blockquote>
It might be worthwhile amending the clause so that an inspector at an inquiry would be able to recommend that an order be made by the Secretary of State. That seems more suitable than giving an inspector the power to make a decision at the end of a public inquiry. The Secretary of State, as a member of an elected Government, bears the ultimate responsibility, not an inspector. The Secretary of State should be called to account for unsatisfactory decisions, even if they are based on an inspector's recommendations. The clause would allow a publicly unaccountable person to make perfectly outrageous decisions for which the Secretary of State would eventually carry the can. Such a transfer of power would seem incautious, given the potential of even the most reliable human beings to make decisions that are completely unacceptable.<br><br>
In that connection, I recommend that the Minister bear in mind the Broadcasting Act 1990, which was supposed to reward Bruce Gyngell, the head of TV-am, for his attack on the trade unions. However, the Independent Television Commission, which was set up by the Act with the power to award franchises, was very naughty: Bruce Gyngell was not rewarded, as had been expected, with the franchise for independent breakfast television. The former Prime Minister immediately wrote a letter to him apologising for the inconsistency of human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is making only a passing reference, as the person whom he has mentioned is certainly not a Minister in the Department of Transport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right, Mr. Latham. The reference is only in passing but, by way of explanation, I made it to remind the Minister that he should never rely on other people to do exactly as he wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that that commission's independence would have suited the hon. Gentleman more than the prejudice of politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am merely pointing out that the decisions of an independently appointed body may not be consistent with the expectations placed on it. Although the Secretary of State may appoint someone who it is believed will implement his or her policies, that person may make decisions that are contrary to the Secretary of State's view.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
The existing system that operates for roads and other public inquiries, in which the inspector makes recommendations to the Minister and the Minister makes the decisions, taking into account the inspector's recommendations, is more satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I have tabled a later amendment to the clause, it may be more appropriate to deal with the matter now. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) says, the power that is already in the hands of a Committee of the House is not just being devolved to the Secretary of State; there is express authority that that can be devolved further and, moreover, that the Secretary of State can define the category of applications that can be so devolved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman speaking to amendment No. 88? If so, it might be more appropriate to discuss that later when I might have some pleasant news for him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am dealing not with that amendment, but with the background to it, which pertains to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South said. However, I am grateful to the Minister for that intimation.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Transport has, quite reasonably, passed responsibility for this matter to the Minister. We know what happens in practice. Assistant secretaries or deputy assistant secretaries in the Department of Transport come at certain time of day, arranged by a Minister's diary secretary, to ask the permission of that Minister—who is responsible to the Secretary of State for Transport—to make decisions on various matters. Even under the Bill as it stands, the Secretary of State will not make the decisions, and the Minister involved may have relatively little time to deal with the many matters under his responsibility—new tramways, railways and the fast link will be only a few of them. Therefore, other people apart from the Minister and the Secretary of State will be involved and decisions may even be made by someone with less experience than those who occupy the exalted position of assistant secretary.<br><br>
We are being asked to approve the principle that all the powers invested in the Secretary of State may, by regulation, be dealt with by a person appointed by the Secretary of State. What does "dealt with" mean? It is a practical term and would give virtually total power to a servant of the Crown who is responsible to the Minister. That person, because of the pressure of events and the specialist nature of the matter, may be acting on his own behalf, though under the instruction of the Secretary of State. The clause goes further than many people may have realised and therefore I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South on the issue of future safeguards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) made clear during our discussions his worries about the extent to which the Bill provides for the transfer of powers away from Parliament. Nevertheless, I hope to persuade him that the proposals in clause 24 are not as dangerous as he fears.<br><br>
I recognise that, at first sight, the provisions look rather sweeping. They seem to allow the Secretary of State to transfer his functions under the Bill to anyone whom he chooses to appoint for these purposes. The intentions are, however, entirely honourable. The clause is not designed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0741">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
to provide an underhand way for the Secretary of State to duck his responsibilities to Parliament, or to prevent Parliament from keeping a check on the exercise of the powers which it has transferred.<br><br>
The provision has been included in the Bill in the interests of flexibility and efficiency. The power of the Secretary of State to transfer his functions will be exercised only if it becomes apparent that there is a class of proposals of a type that reasonably can be decided by an appointed person without reference back to him. That might mean transferring to inspectors, for example, straightforward proposals that do not involve compulsory purchase of property, or ones of a purely local character.<br><br>
We decided that the power would be a useful one to have in reserve after we had dropped the proposals in the consultation document for the determination of applications of local significance by local authorities. There were problems with that idea which made it impracticable, and I shall explain why when we consider new clause 4. The proposals in clause 24 at least leave open the possibility of a simpler way of dealing with some types of application. A similar provision, which has appeared in town and country planning legislation since 1968, has proved to be very suitable for dealing with many types of planning appeal. We therefore think that there is a great deal of sense in including such a provision in the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the provision in subsection (9) for regulations made under the clause to be subject to the annulment procedure in Parliament will show that there is nothing suspicious about our intentions. The powers which Parliament is transferring to the Secretary of State will not be further transferred without Parliament having the opportunity to scrutinise and, if necessary, reject the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the power to make regulations under clause 24 shall be exercisable by statutory instrument, but subsection (3)(a) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person appointed under this section shall have in relation to the application—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) the same powers and duties as the Secretary of State has under sections 1 and 3 above".</p></blockquote>
Does "sections 1 and 3" refer to clauses 1 and 3 and the power to make statutory instruments, which are still not modified by requiring them to be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament? Clause 24 appears to empower the inspector to issue orders that are not subject to any further parliamentary procedure under clauses 1 and 3. Will the Minister confirm that that is correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that what the hon. Member for Bradford, South has said is correct because there are safeguards. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the details now, but I shall return to the point. I hope that 1 have shown that there is a suitable safeguard in place regarding the procedure for coming back to Parliament with orders.<br><br>
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern. As I have been unable to answer his question fully, I shall look at it closely and, if necessary, return to it on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his comments because, if my supposition is not correct, there is an anomaly. I have already quoted subsection (3)(a). Subsection (4) states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Where an application has been dealt with by a person appointed under this section, any order made by him under section 1 or 3 shall be treated as made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That provides a clear power that is set out in clauses 1 and 3—that is, to make statutory instruments that are not subject to any further parliamentary procedure. That is a significant power.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
However, as the Minister said, subsection (9) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The power to make regulations under this section shall be exercisable by statutory instrument, which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that orders made by the appointed person are not subject to the same procedure as that set out in clauses 1 and 3, and that all orders made by him or her will be statutory instruments that are subject to negative procedure? If that is the case, the Minister is right and subsection (9) is a safeguard. However, the matter is not clear. Amendments should be tabled on Report to make the position clear beyond peradventure, as lawyers say.<br><br>
I wish to keep lawyers out of matters because they are expensive, they cause much anxiety and any side can employ a lawyer to support a case. That leads to litigation and we wish to avoid that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has presented a valid case. I shall examine his points carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I look forward to his tabling yet another amendment on Report, that will clarify the matter. Our discussions demonstrate the importance of the Committee stage of a Bill. In Committee, we can weed out conflicts and confusion and thus avoid litigation. It is important that legislation is clear and that people can use it without resort to conflict.<br><br>
We have discussed a procedure that may involve controversy. The Minister said that inspectors would not be involved in circumstances where compulsory purchase was likely. He should consider incorporating that in the Bill. Compulsory purchase often generates enormous controversy. Cases could be subject to judicial review and applications to court because the right of appointed persons to make decisions was not clear.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to narrow, as accurately as possible, the definition of the powers of the appointed person. In the light of the Minister's undertaking to examine the matter and, I hope, table an amendment to clarify the point on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 12, line 9, after 'this', insert 'Part of this'.<br><br>
The amendment would place beyond doubt the fact that the Secretary of State's power to transfer his powers and duties to an appointed person refers only to part I of the Bill and the responsibilities for the new order-making procedure. There was no intention to make clause 24 arrangements apply to drink and drugs and other safety provisions in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 12, line 21, after '(a)', insert 'in stating a reason'.<br><br>
To revert to the happy remarks that the Minister made a few moments ago, I understand the need to change horses in mid-stream if someone is ill or worse. There should be a mechanism whereby the Minister can replace
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0742">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
such a person. Amendment No. 88 clarifies the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South made on amendment No. 121. I sense that the seed may not have fallen on stony ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the amendment in principle. However, I wish to reflect on the wording and the drafting. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, but I undertake to table an amendment on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful, not just for the Minister's words, but for that virtual undertaking. I hope that those who write textbooks about Parliament will take note of that and chalk it up to amendments other than those tabled by the Government. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 12, line 38, after 'Environment', insert ', the Department of Energy'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 90.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment Nos. 89 and 90 are minor amendments, which need not detain the Committee for long. They recognise the possibility that energy-related schemes proposed under clause 3, such as tidal energy barrages, may give rise to a class of applications which would be suitable for transfer to an appointed person.<br><br>
While it is somewhat unlikely that the effects of barrage schemes will be significantly local or uncomplicated for them appropriately to be decided by anyone other than the Secretary of State, there might be some subsidiary orders that could be dealt with more efficiently by an appointed person. The amendment allows for that possibility by extending the application of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 to officers of the Department of Energy. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 90, in page 12, line 46, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(aa) if he was appointed by the Secretary of State for the time being having general responsibility in energy matters, as functions of the Department of Energy;'.—<i>[Mr. McLoughlin.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 13, line 2, leave out from 'subject' to end of line 3 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'to approval by Resolution of both Houses of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote>
We are back on familiar ground discussing the merits of annulment and approval. The Minister said that the clause was not far reaching and hinted that he might introduce an amendment to take account of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South about compulsory purchase. Nevertheless, I suggest that one of the advantages of an affirmative order is that it goes before the House on the Order Paper. It goes through on the nod and everyone is happy because it is done within the spirit of the Act. It is not an unexpected use of power and, therefore, it does not risk any objection or debate. That is an example of the Secretary of State devolving powers that were given to him by Parliament. However narrow those powers may be, there is a case for making them subject to affirmative resolution rather than to annulment.<br><br>
The Minister reassured us by saying that Parliament had the opportunity to scrutinize and object. I know that, in theory, negative orders come within that category, but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
I suspect that it is a lawyers' description. I hope that the Minister will consider upgrading the statutory instruments from negative to affirmative orders for the reasons that I have outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern that the creation of regulations under clause 24 should be subject to the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny. However, I remain unconvinced that the subject matter of the regulations is of such importance that it automatically requires a debate to be held in Parliament. As I have already explained, only for the local and relatively simple applications shall we consider using the powers contained in clause 24 to transfer the decision to an appointed person.<br><br>
That does not represent the same fundamental issue of principle as the initial transfer of power from Parliament, which would be achieved by the enactment of the Bill and by orders under clauses 2 and 4. As the Committee is aware, I have agreed that the latter orders should be subject to the affirmative procedure for that reason. In contrast, clause 24 regulations will not, to the same extent, involve fundamental issues of principle. Nor will their effect be of the same national significance as, for example, the extension of the new order-making procedure for the new category of transport works. I believe that the regulations are more aligned with the procedure rules that will be made under clause 6, which I have accepted should be subject to the annulment procedure. I consider that the degree of scrutiny afforded to the annulment procedure will be adequate for making clause 24 regulations, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's remarks suggest that it is even more important to incorporate in the clause the definition and duties of the appointed person. He said that the appointed person would deal only with issues of local significance. Subsection (9) is justified if the preceding subsections exclude, for example, compulsory purchase issues and clarify and define issues of local importance. Unless and until those definitions are added to the clause, a question mark remains over subsection (9), as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South has explained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can appreciate the reason for the Minister drawing a distinction in his carefully prepared reply between the affirmative and the negative order.<br><br>
I believe that the Minister used the words "required debate". Almost always there is no debate on instruments subject to the affirmative procedure; they simply risk a debate. That is very different. We all know what happens at half-past two and occasionally at 10 o'clock—Mr. Speaker, amid enormous hubbub, puts the Question on a statutory instrument. The Whips say, "Aye, aye" and the instrument is passed. That is right because it appears on the Order Paper for all to see, which is a great democratic safeguard. Without looking at statistics, I would guess that most affirmative instruments go through on the nod. There is a safeguard, but it does not necessarily mean that there will be a debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It should be put on the record that it is rare for affirmative orders to go through on the nod on the Floor of the House. If affirmative orders are relatively uncontroversial, they are referred to Committees. On the Floor, hon. Members simply vote on those orders after they have been considered in

Committee. I accept that some orders go through Committee on the nod, but on affirmative orders the House usually votes—perhaps archaically with a deferred vote—after the order has been in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend; he may well be right and I shall stand corrected. It would be interesting to know how many affirmative orders are debated. We are all learning, and I may be wrong. Nevertheless, we have had a fascinating exchange.</span></p>

PRIVATE LEGISLATION PROCEDURE IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with Scotland. Before Christmas, there was a little unease in the Committee that all the interested bodies in England had not been consulted about the clauses. I shall not rehearse the arguments on that as I understand that the Government want to make progress on the Bill. Is the Minister satisfied that all bodies in Scotland that may be affected have been consulted? Have objections been received from people in Scotland to this small modification to the procedures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding, based on information received from the Association of Railway Preservation Scocieties Ltd., is that the Scottish procedure for obtaining authority to operate railways is simpler than ours and that consultation has taken place between the Department and the association. I understand that the Minister intends to table amendments to ensure that the procedure is not unnecessarily complicated. Can he confirm that the appropriate amendments are being tabled or will be tabled later?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather reluctant to say that I have consulted everyone who would like to be or should be consulted. To the best of my knowledge, everyone who has an interest in the matter in Scotland has been consulted, but I want to give myself 1 per cent. flexibility as I do not want to be accused of misleading the Committee.<br><br>
In reply to the point of the hon. Member for Bradford, South, I can confirm that I have consulted my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Adley), the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and other people who made representations. I have already tabled amendments that will meet the points that they asked the Government to concede.</span></p>

TRANSPORT SYSTEMS TO WHICH CHAPTER I APPLIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 27 specifies that the chapter, which involves drink and drugs
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"applies to transport systems of any of the following kinds—
<ol>
<li>a railway;</li>
<li>a tramway;</li>
<li>a system which uses another mode of guided transport and is specified for the purposes of this Chapter by an order made by the Secretary of State."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Chapter shall not apply to a transport system unless it is used, or is intended to be used, wholly or partly for the carriage of members of the public."</p></blockquote>
I wrote to the Minister recently—he replied on 14 January—asking about the transportation of dangerous girders. I referred to private industrial railways, such as those within steel works, chemical works, mines and military installations. I realise now that the clause does not cover those railways. In his reply to me, the Minister said that they were excluded because they were covered by the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. However, that Act would not impose a sufficiently tight restriction on private industrial railways. Will the Minister consider re-examining that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We considered carefully private industrial railways in steel works, ports, mines and military installations. In excluding such systems, we were following the application of the drink and drugs provisions in the Road Traffic Act 1988, which are restricted to vehicles on roads in public places. We believe that public safety in factory environments is best regulated by the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. In addition to the general duties of the employers and their employees, section 3 of that Act imposes a duty on employers to conduct their undertakings to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that people not in their employment who may be affected are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.<br><br>
The application of chapter 1 of part II of the Bill to industrial railways could create difficulties on important issues. For example, it would involve the police entering private property more often than they do at present. We also foresee problems in enforcing such measures in underground railways and mines. Health and safety inspectors are commonly on such premises and can be expected to ensure that the correct safety systems are in place. However, as the hon. Member for Southport has asked me to consider that point, I shall do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) has raised an important point. The notes on clauses describe the police powers available in chapter 1 as sufficient to enable a British Rail driver
<br><blockquote><p>"to be breath tested at the siding for an offence on the BR network."</p></blockquote>
That leaves a loophole.<br><br>
I try not to bore the Committee with my railway reminiscences, but one comes to mind. At Stanlow near Birkenhead there is a large petro-chemical complex owned by one of the major petroleum companies. During my days as a guard in the 1960s it was a duty to work trains from the Stockport area to that complex and back. When the outward working of the train was cancelled, we had to travel as passengers to Birkenhead and make our way to Stanlow to the privately owned siding to carry out the return part of our rostered duty.<br><br>
I have read the notes on clause and listened to the hon. Member for Southport. It would not have been impossible—although, of course, very unlikely—for that train crew to have enjoyed a certain amount of alcohol before
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0744">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
boarding the locomotive for the return trip to the Greater Manchester area. As I understand the Bill, the train crew would be guilty of an offence under the Bill only after the train entered the BR track. That is not very sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that inside private or public marshalling yards or sidings where points are worked manually, hand signals are necessary and where clearances are smaller, accuracy of judgment can be more important than on wide stretches of main line?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt about that, but if the facilities are owned by BR the offence of imbibing alcohol will be covered by the Bill. I gave my example because the Bill does not cover privately owned sidings. The offence would be committed only when the train passed from the privately owned sidings to the British Rail track, which is a bit late.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the details of the Stanlow private siding, but on some private sidings it is possible for the locomotive to be within the private area and for the part of the train which did the damage to be outside. Would my hon. Friend care to speculate on whether the driver would have committed an offence in those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feared that once we donned our railway caps and lit our hand lamps, many examples would be given. I prefer to stay with my example. I hope that the Minister understands that I have described a logical, albeit unlikely, chain of events. Has he thought about extending the provisions of the Bill to cover the numerous privately owned sidings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The legislation covers two issues—first, the protection of members of the public, which is why they are invoked in clause 27, and, secondly, protection for employees who are foolish enough to drink or take drugs
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
when working with locomotives and rolling stock. There is the potential for danger on industrial sidings, where a great deal of shunting takes place to make up trains ready for British Rail to take away. British Rail is dealing with trainload workings now because, to my great regret, single wagonload workings have been withdrawn. Using manually operated points and going between wagons and locomotives when the buffers have to be squeezed up for coupling needs steady eyes and hands and a clear head. The Minister should consider incorporating industrial operations in the proposal because of the potential danger to the operators, although there are few such incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. The correct distinction has been drawn. The Bill refers to public transport and transportation of the public. The Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 covers matters relating to the protection of one's own operations. I do not know a great deal about that Act, but it puts the responsibility on the individual and on the company, which is an important guideline to the way in which people should conduct themselves in the workplace. Questions have been asked on the subject and the Committee is anxious about it. I shall therefore look again at the matter.<br><br>
At present, I am content that the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 covers the anomalies. It has been accepted that such incidents do not happen regularly and that it is not a huge problem, but we shall consider tidying up the provision in the light of the examples given by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East. As I said, we are discussing public transport and dangers to the public.</span></p>
