VALUATION TRIBUNALS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [26 November]: No. 191, in page 9, line 40, at the end to add the
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Such tribunals shall compile, and the Secretary of State shall publish, annually from 1 April 1994 reports setting out—
<ol>
<li>the numbers of appeals to each tribunal;</li>
<li>the proportion of appeals which were successful; and</li>
<li>an estimate of the average waiting time before appeals were heard, measured at the beginning and end of the financial year concerned.".—[<i>Mr. Blunkett.</i>]</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a pleasure it is to be back in Committee. It seems but a twinkling of an eye—if not a shut eye—since we were last here.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Members for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) and for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) for having raised many points late last night, which I shall try to deal with before I come to the substance of the amendments.<br><br>
There is sometimes an aura of mystery surrounding tribunals. There are no proposals to change the present arrangements, and I think that it would be helpful if I explained them. Opposition Members were telling scare stories about the likely number of appeals and about the way in which cases will be handled by tribunals. Members of what are currently the valuation and community charge tribunals—they will become valuation tribunals—are appointed by county councils, metropolitan districts and London boroughs. Members are unpaid, although they can claim a financial loss allowance. They come from all walks of life. Relatively few are experts in legal or rating matters, although many are councillors or ex-councillors. It is important, for the sake of the tribunals' credibility as independent and impartial bodies, that members' appointments are not seen as political. The valuation tribunal system has existed for about 40 years and it has an enviable reputation for its impartiality and fairness. I thank and congratulate the members, presidents and professional support staff of the tribunals.<br><br>
This summer, I spoke at the national conference of valuation and community charge tribunals which was held at a remarkable hotel near Coventry. Coventry—or Warwickshire—is in the heart of England and I was surprised that the hotel had Neptune as its theme, with lots of flowing fountains
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
and baths. Never mind, it was exciting to be in the heart of England, especially as I was addressing such distinguished people who play an important role in our national life. The tribunal service provides training for its members and its staff in the legal issues with which they have to deal: rating and liability law. The Department of the Environment funds that training and spent about £100,000 on it in 1991. The clerk of the tribunal is professionally trained and his or her main role is to advise members on the law on any case, before them. The clerk takes no part in the decisions of the tribunal, which are the sole responsibility of the members, but his or her presence gives members access to advice from a legal expert.<br><br>
The tribunals have a long history of service to the community. They have an enviable track record. Research has shown that appellants are almost always satisfied with the way in which their cases have been handled. I am confident that the tribunals will continue to provide a high-quality service, when they come to deal with council tax valuations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the tribute that he paid me and other members of former rating valuation tribunals, but I remind him that it was always felt in the past that the Welsh Office and the Department of the Environment seriously underfunded the rating valuation tribunals, forcing them to exist on a shoestring.<br><br>
As the number of appeals is likely to increase, will the Minister tell us exactly how much more money the tribunals will receive to deal with the extra work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to start the day on that positive note. I shall come to funding, and the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), who I know has a particular interest in it, will be reassured.<br><br>
Some hon. Members were concerned about the timetable for tribunals. In valuation matters, proposals will go automatically to appeal after six months if they have not been resolved with the valuation office. Other matters will go automatically if not resolved within two months. It is not possible to prescribe a timescale for tribunals to deal with appeals. On valuation and non-valuation matters, appeals do not go straight to a tribunal. Proposals on valuation will be made first to the listing officer and will, in most cases, be settled between the taxpayer and the valuation office. It is only when agreement cannot be reached that the appeal will go to a tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will tell us what information will be supplied to the owners, occupiers or residents of properties when they make an application to the listing officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to do that.<br><br>
Last night—you were not here, Sir Michael, and we missed you very much—we had three speeches in two hours from the Opposition, in which scores of questions were asked. I shall attempt to answer them, and I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I did not have to cope with too many interventions. If there are too many, we would be in danger of discussing less than we would wish.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0284">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
In non-valuation matters, the first recourse for a member of the public is to discuss the problem with the local authority and to proceed to the tribunal only if the matter cannot be settled. Questions were asked about who would decide on the priority of different types of appeal. The hon. Member for Leyton, who has unfortunately not returned to the Committee after his coffee break, will no doubt read in <i>Hansard</i> the answers that I am about to give.<br><br>
Traditionally, and rightly, priorities are a matter for the president of the tribunal. Each tribunal needs to set its own priorities following the pattern of different types of appeal in its own area. That is not a matter of great contention.<br><br>
Publicity on appeals is important and we shall, of course, ensure that adequate publicity about the right of appeal and the procedures is available, as we did with the community charge and non-domestic rates. We shall consider seriously the possibility of including leaflets and information with council tax bills. That could be helpful. It is too early, however, to give a commitment on the precise arrangements.<br><br>
The main right, on valuation, will belong to the resident of a property. The owner of the property and local authorities will also have an interest in the valuation and will, therefore, also be able to make proposals and appeals. Their rights will in no way override or negate those of residents.<br><br>
Understandably, hon. Members are concerned about the costs of appeals. We estimate that tribunals will require 175 additional staff, to add to their current staff of 240. That will cost about £5 million more a year than the current costs of £9.2 million.<br><br>
Most appeals will not reach tribunals. They will be settled by the listing officer to whom an original proposal on the valuation was made or by local authorities in other respects. I accept that there will be extra costs for the valuation office. Those costs will arise in maintaining lists and dealing with proposals and appeals. The costs have been estimated at about £31 million a year. The valuation office will require 380 extra staff for 1993–94.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Makerfield was particularly concerned about the procedure for appeals beyond the tribunals. I have already hinted at the answer. The only further right of appeal will be to the High Court on points of law, as he suggested. There will be no scope for a local authority to seek a second appeal simply because it disagrees with the judgment of the tribunal. We have considered a commissioner procedure as described by the hon. Member for Makerfield. The important point is that even if we had a commissioner system, it would not be possible to deprive citizens of rights of appeal on points of law to the High Court, so it would simply interpose another layer. That is not the right way to proceed and we have no intention of taking that course.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton gave us the benefit of his views on the payment of the council tax while an appeal was outstanding. I have been brought up to believe, and I am sure that it is right, that one should pay first and argue later. People are liable to pay as soon as they receive a bill or a demand notice.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
The fact that they have registered an appeal against their banding or discount does not mean that they do not have to pay. Arrangements will be made for refunds should an appeal be successful.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton talked about discussions with local authority associations and others that are still continuing. I shall, on this occasion, take the advice of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who opined yesterday that rather than dressing up speculation as contentious fact, it would be wiser to say from the outset that many of the matters that will find their way into regulations are still the subject of discussion. As the hon. Member for Brightside said, discussions are proceeding apace. I am sure that the hon. Member for Leyton would agree that there would be little point discussing anything with anyone if we had already decided on all the small print.<br><br>
The amendment would require the Secretary of State to publish statistics showing the number of appeals received each year by each valuation tribunal, the proportion of those appeals that were successful and an estimate of the average time appellants had to wait to have their appeal heard by a tribunal. I have some sympathy with the motives behind the amendment. It is clearly essential that appellants to valuation tribunals should be assured that their case will be dealt with expeditiously. Tribunals should closely monitor their own performance as statistics on their progress in clearing appeals should be available.<br><br>
In view of all the concerns expressed, the Committee will be interested to know that my Department is currently undertaking a wide-ranging financial, management and policy review of valuation and community charge tribunals. There are 56 separate, independent tribunals around the country: their 2,500 members operate from 42 offices and employ about 240 staff. Until now the tribunals and their offices have been largely independent of each other and of the Department. It is essential that in quasi-judicial matters they should be completely independent. There has traditionally been a high level of satisfaction with the service provided by the tribunal system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many of the 2,500 members are quantity surveyors? Would they or partners in their company be entitled to bid for the valuation work under the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is under discussion here. We are discussing the tribunals, not the banding process which is what I think the hon. Gentleman is confusing them with. There are 56 separate independent tribunals around the country. I cannot tell him how many members of tribunals are surveyors. I doubt whether we collect that information centrally but I shall do my best to get an answer in a reasonable time—I certainly do not have it in my head. If the hon. Gentleman is patient we may return to that point later.<br><br>
There has been a high level of satisfaction with the service. An independent report published in 1987 into the handling of domestic rating appeals found
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0285">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
that with few exceptions rate payers were satisfied that they had received a fair hearing. It found that the tribunals, or valuation courts as they were then called, were friendly, informal and impartial.<br><br>
Putting aside the question of the tribunals' independence, we are concerned that there is a lack of strategic and financial management for the service as a whole. That does not allow for a co-ordinated response for the appeals workload. So far my Department has bid for and allocated resources to tribunals, and in doing so has set broad targets for the rate at which it believes appeals will be cleared. That has happended without the direct involvement of tribunals. As a consequence, targets have had little meaning. It will be of interest to the hon. Member for Torfaen that one of the key aims of the current review will be to involve tribunals more in their own strategic management, especially in setting targets. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Torfaen is distracted by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), so I shall repeat what I have just said. One of the key aims is to ensure that there is more direct involvement by the tribunals, especially in setting targets. The review is not yet complete but a report is due to be published by the end of the year, so we shall not have long to wait.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I have received messages from heaven about surveyors. Although I cannot tell the hon. Member for Cathcart exactly how many quantity surveyors are employed among the many members of tribunals and their professional staff because we do not collect such figures centrally, it is important to remember that no member can sit on a tribunal if he has an interest that may have a bearing on his work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is fine in terms of the individual involved but, as far as I understand current Scottish law, if a member on the present valuation appeals committee is a quantity surveyor—there are one or two surveyors on appeals committees in Scotland—he is barred from representing a client who is making an appeal, as are his partners. Furthermore, if surveyors are on a valuation appeals committee, will their companies be barred from bidding for the work of banding valuations because a conflict of interest may be involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish my argument before responding to the hon. Gentleman's intervention. I wish to finish my comments about the report, which is of particular interest to the hon. Member for Torfaen. The report will make recommendations on how tribunals should become involved in target setting. Targets should encompass broad measures such as the number of appeals cleared each year, and measures about the quality of service. That may include the waiting time before the appeal is heard or the quality of written reasons provided after an appeal decision. The achievement of targets on qualitative measures will be in the spirit of the citizens charter. We shall discuss those measures each year with the National Committee of Valuation and Community Charge Tribunals. Targets will be published in my Department's annual report. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
report will also compare the previous year's performance with that year's targets.<br><br>
The review will consider the option of a detailed annual report of the service submitted to the Secretary of State by the national president of the tribunals. That would meet the spirit of the amendment. Statistics on the number of appeals received by valuation and community charge tribunals are already available. My Department circulates every quarter to all tribunals a monitor of statistics showing the number of new cases received and the number cleared, withdrawn or agreed without a hearing and the number listed for hearing in future. An annual summary of the aggregate figures is provided for use in my Department's annual report. Anyone interested in the detailed figures can obtain them from my Department in time-honoured ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about which annual report the hon. Gentleman refers to. The Department of the Environment produces an annual report and recently produced a helpful report summarising progress on "This Common Inheritance". But the target figures were dropped in that report. Is the hon. Gentleman referring to the same style of report? Will it contain specific target figures, and will there be an intention to achieve something at some distant date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on a good point. We use the figures in our annual report as appropriate. The full figures are avaiable and I explained earlier how we wish to ensure that there is more involvement by tribunals in meeting targets. That will meet the spirit of the amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart rightly said that the Scots have a different system and rules for surveyors. In England, it is for the president of the tribunal to decide whether there is a conflict of interest, and members have to exclude themselves if there is even an appearance of bias.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present, that may be true because conflicts of interest are small. A partner may represent a client, and his partner on the tribunal should take himself off. With the involvement of companies in valuations for the banding system, it becomes a new ball game. The Government must take account of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and take his point. He suggests that the present self-policing system may be inadequate. I should like to consider the matter again.<br><br>
At present, we do not maintain waiting-time statistics. I do not know how easy it would be to do so. As I have said, we shall discuss such qualitative measures with the tribunals and aim to incorporate them into the tribunal's strategy. It would be more difficult to collect meaningful statistics on the proportion of successful appeals. Success is difficult to define. Should it include partially successful bids or only those proposals for a lower valuation that are accepted in whole? Valuation tribunals will deal with non-domestic rating appeals, which involve precise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0286">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
valuations rather than banding, as well as council tax and other appeals.<br><br>
A non-domestic ratepayer could be satisfied with an appeal that was not, on the face of it, a success. Not all appeals end up before a tribunal. They may be agreed or withdrawn before a hearing. They may be agreed in principle between the appellant and the listing officer and confirmed by the tribunal. In some cases, the tribunal may dispose of an appeal on the basis of written representations without a hearing. Statistics on the success rate of appeal hearings would not be useful or meaningful. They should not be incorporated into targets in the same way as clearance rates. It is for the independent tribunals, with a proven track record in valuation appeals extending over 40 years, to decide each case on the basis of the facts. It would be in no one's interest to interfere with that.<br><br>
In summary, I support much of the aim of the amendment. I hope that I have satisfied Opposition Members that our current financial management and policy review of the valuation and community charge tribunal service will cover the issues that have been raised during our consideration of the amendment. The aim will be to encourage all valuation tribunals to strive for the highest standards of service, in line with the citizens charter and in keeping with modern financial management practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the advice of the Under-Secretary on the involvement of the valuation tribunal with property valuation. The council tax is made up of two elements. The property element can be judged by surveyors and others. What about the element that involves the head count? There could be difficulties in respect of that and people should have the right of appeal. How will the division between the property valuation and the head count be identified so that people know what they can appeal about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We discussed that last night. People will obtain such information from their bills. I mentioned the possibility of leafleting.<br><br>
The priorities to be set by the different tribunals will be for the presidents to decide in the light of the needs of their areas. It would not be right for us to lay down a national set of priorities. It would depend on the number of cases at any one time. I am sure that to devolve that power to the presidents of the tribunals is the right way forward.<br><br>
These are management rather than policy matters. The intervention of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) applies to the amendment as a whole. I support the aims of Opposition Members and I have tried to show that we have taken on board almost all the points that they have raised. They will not be surprised to discover that my hon. Friend the Minister of State has thought of everything—this is yet another example of that—in preparing the Bill. Therefore, it is not necessary or appropriate to incorporate their suggestions in the Bill. With my assurances as to our intentions, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Under-Secretary's efforts. I appreciate that we sat very late last night and that at some moments our debates were inevitably light-hearted, but we drew attention to many underlying problems, some of which he has touched on and others he has not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This morning I asked what information would be given to people who made the initial approach to the listing officer. I shall be interested to read <i>Hansard</i> to see whether I understand the answer or whether it came.<br><br>
In the early hours of this morning we raised some key questions about the volume of appeals. People may appeal because they are not aware of the exact value that has been placed on their property because of the banding and valuation system. There will be a tendency for people to appeal to learn whether they were only marginally in a higher band and whether it would be worth their while pressing the appeal to get a 16 per cent reduction by moving into a lower band. We asked also what training will be given to ensure that we have enough members on appeal tribunals to do the job. The extra £5 million allocated to run the system is welcome, but what about preparing for that system and the likely avalanche of appeals as from January on valuations and the discount system following the introduction of the tax?<br><br>
We have asked a range of serious questions about the operation of the scheme and the pressure that will be brought to bear when the poll tax is coming to an end and the council tax—the property poll tax—is being introduced. The same questions would arise on our fair rates system, except that the Government can do something about the problems now and we shall have to pick up the pieces in May or June next year. Those questions could be dealt with now to avoid the foreseeable catastrophe that will result from the juxtaposition of the demise of the poll tax, the introduction of a new tax system, whatever that might be, the appeals system on valuation with the confusion that banding valuation will inevitably cause, and the problems of coping with the discount system immediately after 1 April.<br><br>
A range of difficulties coming together will cause great problems. It is no good the Ministers saying that they will leave it to local tribunals to sort out. The only time that the Government are prepared to devolve and decentralise is when they do not have a clue what to recommend from the centre. Devolution and decentralisation are fine when the Government do not know what they are doing, but when there is an answer to a problem they have no intention of allowing any discretion or the wherewithal to make decisions at local level. That is entirely unacceptable. There should be clear guidelines. The amendment sought to elicit information about the Government's preparations or at least their thinking on the speed with which action would be taken in the new year. I regret to say that we are very disappointed that on a complex but foreseeable technical question, the Government cannot give us detailed answers.<br><br>

We shall not press the amendment to a Division because we believe, as the Minister said, that the Government have the matter under review. This is not an ideological party political issue; it is a serious matter and we hope that the Government will have done sufficient preparation on it by the time that we take office to ensure that that chaos can be forestalled. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are minor amendments compared with others that have been debated, but they are no less important. We have been discussing the role of valuations when considering properties. Therefore, we must consider the people who will be responsible for entering the valuations on to the valuation lists. All new houses will be put into one of the eight bands referred to in the Bill. The band will be allocated depending on what the new property would have sold for on 1 April 1991, not the price for which it was purchased. That will ensure that new homes do not pay more than the existing ones.<br><br>
The issue of new dwellings leads one immediately to reflect on the anomalies that may arise, which will be similar to those wrestled with by valuation tribunals when the last valuation took place and rentable values were compared back to 1973. Rate payers appealing against their assessment for numerous reasons were told that the valuation of the property had to be assessed as if it were vacant and available for rent on 1 April 1973. Telling people in 1985 and 1986 that the rentable value of their property had to be considered as far back as 1973 caused bewilderment. They wondered what was wrong with the system when values for the past 12 or 14 years had to be considered. The same problem could arise in this case.<br><br>
It is important that valuations are made by a professional officer and an officer who is committed to looking after the interests of the people in the community. They should not take a commercial view as would happen if people other than a valuation officer and a district valuer were involved.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
Amendment No. 192 is minor but important and the Minister should consider the importance of the proposal contained in amendment No. 193, which would include an additonal provision in clause 17 to the effect that, before any action is taken,
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall detemine the completion day in relation to a new building."</p></blockquote>
Only the district valuer, or the person employed full time by the Inland Revenue commission, should be able to carry out that valuation.<br><br>
Regulations under the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991 were laid before the House on 2 September 1991 in SI No. 1934, while the equivalent SI for Scotland was No. 2022, laid before the House on 9 September 1991. Those measures have some signficance in the question of valuations and the involvement of the valuation officer. Regulation 2 of the English regulations establishes that the value of any domestic property is to be taken to be the amount that it might reasonably have been expected to realise if sold on the open market by a willing vendor by 1 April this year. That is followed by a summary of the assumptions that should be built into such a valuation. The first assumption is that the sale was a vacant possession—that recalls the principal that I mentioned in connection with rentable properties. Secondly, it is assumed that the interest was freehold or, in the case of a flat, a leasehold of 99 years. Thirdly, it is assumed that the sale was free from rent charge and, fourthly, that the size, layout and physical state of locality were the same as at the time when the valuation was made. That covers valuations that may be retrospective for two, three or more years.<br><br>
The fifth assumption is that the property was in a reasonable state of repair, and the sixth, which has more to do with flats than with houses, is that the common parts were in a like state of repair and that the purchaser would have to contribute towards maintenance. Finally, it is assumed that roooms that have been adapted for use by a physically disabled person should be disregarded. Similar provisions apply where there are fixtures designed to make a property habitable for a physically disabled person.<br><br>
Those are the broad principles. I accept that commercial valuers could also taken into consideration the assumptions attached to the valuation regulations. However, we are dealing with people who have bought or who are in the process of buying a property in good faith, who will then be told that that property has been valued at X pounds and that it therefore has been placed in a certain band. If the owner or purchasers of that property consider that the valuation is unreasonable, they will appeal. I assume that the appeal will be contested by a representative from the valuation office and not be a representative from one of the local valuation companies. That was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) in connection with the involvement of commercial operators. The valuation officer who carried out the valuation in the first place should be the person to explain to the appellants why a property has been placed in band F rather than band A.<br><br>
That is why we tabled the amendment. Given their experience and knowledge, the valuation officers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0288">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
should be involved. If a commercial undertaking made an appeal, who would carry out that valuation? If the spirit of the 1988 Act is that the valuation officers should be responsible for valuing commercial and industrial properties, it is difficult to understand why the Bill does not adopt the same approach for valuing domestic properties.<br><br>
In order to rush the Bill through, the Government left valuations in the hands of private operators. I shall do all that I can to prevent the Bill from becoming an Act, but if it does become law, valuation officers employed by the commissioners of Inland Revenue should decide which properties are to be included in the list for charging purposes. I have stated clearly why we consider that that procedure should apply.<br><br>
When the Bill is on the statute book, people will have the right to appeal against a valuation if the circumstances have changed since the valuation was carried out, as at 1 April 1991. That appeal should also be with the valuation officer. We have been told that there will be no calls for revaluations, but people must always have an opportunity to ask for their properties to be revalued. I hope that the Minister can give us—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I am genuinely puzzled. Clause 17 deals with the completion date of new buildings, not with valuations. What is the relevance of valuation to completion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When a property is completed, someone has to decide when it is included in the list for valuations. The question is, who makes that decision? We believe that it should be made by a valuation officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why amendment No. 193 would insert a new subsection in the clause. When the property is completed, someone must decide when it comes into the list for charging. The date that it is nominated applies not only to banding for the purpose of paying local tax but to water and other charges. There could be a dispute over the date of completion.<br><br>
There are cases in my constituency of properties that were built before 1 April 1990 but were not included in the list until after 1 April 1990. Had they been included before 1 April 1990, my constituents could have chosen whether to have their water charges based on metering or on rateable values. They occupied their properties in February. Those dwellings were not valued and included in the list before April and the occupants had no choice but to have a water meter. The inclusion of a new subsection is therefore relevant. The involvement of the valuation officer is important.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I accept that the clause refers to the completion of new dwellings. When will those dwellings be included
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
in the valuation list? Who will make that decision? When a contractor says that a house is ready for occupation, the buyer may claim that he cannot move in until, for example, the drive is completed. When should that house be included in the list? That decision should not be left to a commercial operator in the community; a totally independent valuation officer, employed by the Inland Revenue, should decide.<br><br>
When a dwelling is considered to be complete is a contentious issue. We have been told that there will be no overall review. It is important, therefore, that the nomination date is correct. We stress that strongly, and that is why we have tabled a minor, but significant, amendment. Government spokespersons have told the Committee that the draft valuation list will be ready in December 1992. People will then know in which bands their houses will be placed.<br><br>
Viscount Astor gave some details about the supervision of private sector valuers in another place. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps I may explain precisely how we envisage that it will work. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue are in charge. They will work through their chief valuer's office, which in turn will draw on the local knowledge of district valuers. District valuers will use their detailed knowledge of the characteristics of their area and of professional private sector values in the area. The district valuers have very detailed knowledge. They are in the area and know about it. Armed with that knowledge from within their own management organisation"—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 17 July 1991; Vol. 531, c.235.]</p></blockquote>
My case rests. That was said not by me; Viscount Astor said that it would be in the best interests of the legislation if no valuations were included in the list unless the completion date was decided by the district valuer, his nominee or employee. The Minister would be doing local government and the purchasers of new houses a service if he accepted that the officer responsible for deciding when a new dwelling comes into the list and where it fits into the various bands should be the district valuer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shared your puzzlement, Sir Michael, during the speech of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). Underlying it was a confusion which I hope to clear up and therefore help the hon. Gentleman, who may decide that the amendment is unnecessary.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted the Government to be helpful to local government. In England and Wales, determining whether a building has been completed is a matter not for the valuation office or for the private sector but for local authorities. I believe that the hon. Gentleman would wish the decision as to whether a building has been completed to be in the hands of those most capable of making that determination.<br><br>
At present, the responsibility for determining the completion of a non-domestic building rests with local authorities. That responsibility should go on resting with local authorities in determining the completion of domestic properties under the council tax. My reason for believing that the local authority is the body best suited to do that is that local authorities have contact with people who construct new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
hereditaments or convert existing properties—for example, they have contact at the planning stage, because their building control officers make regular inspections to ensure that foundations are sound and to inspect the drains.<br><br>
At present in England and Wales, it is for local authorities to determine when a building has been completed and then to notify the valuation office. The completion notice that is issued sets a clock ticking. In the case of non-domestic rating, the building will be relieved from non-domestic rates for a period of three months after its completion to give an opportunity for it to be let or sold. Under the council tax, we propose that the clock should tick for six months until a liability arises, if a resident has not moved in in that time. If the property remains empty, after six months it will be liable for council tax. The local authority, with the knowledge gained from its building control and planning officers, notifies the valuation office of the completion date. The valuation office takes over from that point, ensuring that the building is added to the list and that the rates—as exist at present—are charged at the appropriate date on non-domestic properties and ensuring in future that the council tax is charged on domestic properties from the appropriate time.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is anxious about the involvement of the private sector in valuation. That is a separate matter from the amendments. However, the overall responsibility for valuation in England and Wales rests with the valuation office. It is proposed that, in making the initial valuation of properties for setting up the council tax, private sector valuers should be involved. If there were an appeal, the valuation office would remain responsible for the valuation that had been determined. The private valuer may be asked to appear as a witness to explain his advice on the valuation.<br><br>
For the future, when new properties are added to the valuation list, I cannot yet tell the hon. Gentleman whether the valuation office may choose to enlist the help of the private sector in valuing new properties. He will realise that it is part of the Government's general approach that more government work at central and local level should be the subject of competitive tendering. I do not rule it out that, in future, the private sector may be involved in the valuation of new properties. However, it is not for the private sector to determine completion dates—that is a matter for the local authorities.<br><br>
In Scotland the situation is even simpler. There, the assessors are responsible for issuing completion notices and, as they are attached to regional councils, they liaise closely with them. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that there was no provision for overall revaluation. We are proposing a reserve power to enable us to undertake a revaluation, although we shall not set a date for a revaluation and we are not convinced that one will be ncessary.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also said that he wanted people to have the opportunity to appeal against their valuation if they felt that the value of their property had changed so as to render inappropriate the band in which it had been put. The hon. Gentleman may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
recall that, in a previous debate, the Commitee discussed what should happen if circumstances surrounding the property changed—if, for example, opencast mining began outside the property or a motorway was built alongside it. It was decided that the property owner would have an opportunity to appeal on the ground that the valuation band was no longer appropriate because of that change in physical circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister obviously considers that the Scottish system is superior, why, in the longer term—I accept that it would not be possible to do something about the initial banding—does he not bring forward legislation to introduce a system similar to that in Scotland, whereby assessors are employed by local authorities to do that sort of work, instead of it being left to the Inland Revenue and their staff, who obviously cannot tackle the job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot imagine why the hon. Gentleman made that accusation against the valuation office. I did not comment on the superiority of the Scottish system. I commented on the wonderful diversity of the two systems in England and Scotland; two systems co-existing within a United Kingdom, enabling each country to pursue those matters in the manner that best suits it, reinforcing the value of our United Kingdom and underlining the opportunity for each part of that United Kingdom to have its own separate laws and rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A rich diversity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A rich diversity, as my hon. Friend said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we have such a rich diversity of separate laws, as the Minister has said, why on earth are we debating the Scottish and the English clauses as part of the same Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because we are part of the United Kingdom. With the indulgence of the Chair, we have enjoyed many fascinating debates in which matters regarding Scotland and England have been similar and the considerations have been the same. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the enlightenment of the Chair, which has enabled enriching debates on Scotland and England to take place simultaneously. The cross-fertilisation of ideas between the two has made the consideration of the Bill—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We do not want to overcook this delicious feast.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the tactics of the official Opposition have sometimes denied us the opportunity to discuss Scottish clauses in stand part debates, which would have made our debates even finer. None the less, we have been able to discuss many Scottish matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In your presence, Sir Michael, I raised the matter of prisoners, to which the Minister replied,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0290">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
also in your presence. But, yesterday, in your absence, the Minister admitted that he had been teasing me or that he was wrong. It was the latter. I hope that we shall not receive another acknowledgement from the Minister next week that he was wrong again.<br><br>
The Minister said that it was for local authorities to decide when a property would be completed and ready for inclusion in the list. Then the matter would be passed to the valuation officer for him to decide the correct banding for the property. Will he confirm that either the building control and planning department or the environmental services department of the local authority will make the decision? The Minister said that it is for the local authority to decide, yet there is a Bill before another place that will take from local authorities responsibility for planning control and other aministrative services.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I have been trying to ensure that people who purchase a new dwelling have the benefit of an impartial operator deciding when the property should be added to the list. If the Minister assures me that the local authority will always make that decision, I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment. However, I do not want the Minister to say tomorrow or next week that he was again teasing, or that he was wrong about that important issue.<br><br>
Our discussions on the poll tax Bill in 1988 are being mirrored in our debates on this Bill—especially in respect of the guillotine motion. I am trying to be constructive and to ensure that the decisions will be correct and in the best interests of local government. If the Minister assures me that local authorities will decide whether new dwellings have been completed, I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. Clause 17 refers to schedule 4A to the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If it comes to the notice of a charging authority that the work remaining to be done on a new building in its area is such that the building can reasonably be expected to be completed within 3 months, the authority shall serve a notice under this paragraph on the owner of the building as soon as is reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt that that duty is the responsibility of charging—that is, local—authorities. In the case of the council tax, the reference to three months is superceded by the reference to six months. Schedule 4A to the 1988 Act currently deals with non-domestic rating. As the clause amends schedule 4A, I believe that it will be clear to the hon. Gentleman beyond peradventure that the charging authority will be responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reference to the 1988 Act is relevant, but we are aware that that Act refers to a three-month period. We are concerned about the six-month period to which the Minister referred. If there will be no change from the principle of the 1988 Act, and the local authority will be the responsible body, I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
I have a further question, about a mixed hereditament—a domestic flat above a shop. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
valuation officer will be involved in the commercial part. I accept that it is the same principle as applies to when completion might be registered, but I still believe that the valuation officer should have some input into when the building comes into the list for charging purposes. Perhaps the Minister will address that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so, but it does not raise any different issues of principle. If a building has been completed, whether it is domestic or non-domestic, the local authority will reach a view and inform the valuation officer. He will enter it in the list and the appropriate clocks for non-domestic rates and council tax will start ticking. I see no new issue of principle simply because a domestic and a non-domestic property are included within a single building.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister assured me that when he said that the clock starts ticking, he meant the start of the six-month period. A person who was purchasing a dwelling who felt that the completion date as nominated by the local authority was not right would have a right to appeal. It is all very well the local authority saying that the building is ready for occupation, but when the snagging takes place the purchaser will not take responsibility for that dwelling until it is ready for occupation. I want that issue clarified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is the danger of a misunderstanding. When a person becomes resident in a property, whether it be new or old, he will be liable to council tax from the date of residence. I thought that until now we had been addressing the question of what happens if a new property is not occupied, in which case the clock starts ticking from the date that it is completed. If, after six months, it is still unoccupied, the owner of the property—because there is no resident—will be eligible for reduced council tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue that matter. I can see anomalies, because people disposing of other properties may not move in for more than six months. In view of the Minister's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

relatives of people who have died. In some cases, even those who have died have been sent poll tax bills. It occurs again and again. Headlines in newspapers such as the <i>Glasgow Evening Times</i> and local newspapers read, "Widow receives bill for £5 for deceased husband". I realise that it is not entirely relevant, but the clause obviously deals with such arrangements. Will the Minister explain what it means and why Scotland is dealt with differently?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must explain at this juncture that we are not discussing the Scottish clauses. Therefore, only brief statements can be made on the subject. I fully accept that the hon. Member did honour that undertaking. Under the same restriction, I call Mrs Michie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what you say, Sir Michael. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland had promised to reply to me under clause 71, but the guillotine fell and he did not get the opportunity. I want it placed on record that people will not be liable for payment of the council tax on the day that they die, but will be charged up until midnight on the day before they die. I should like that to be written down somewhere so that I may show it to my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I put on record that the hon. Lady's understanding of the position is correct. I appreciate the sensitive nature of her point, so I am glad to confirm that those who die in the course of a day are deemed to have died for the whole day.<br><br>
The important point to make about clause 18 is the difference between the community charge and the council tax. The community charge involves a personal liability, the council tax, a householder liability. I am happy to assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that, for example, Scots law on the transfer to the executors of the liability for repayment covers the provisions of clause 18. That is why it is not necessary to have a comparable provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present, when a debt is very small, a local authority in Scotland has no right to say that it will not bother to collect it. Will local authorities in Scotland be able to write off a debt amounting to only a few pounds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not quite right. The liability would transfer to the executors. It could transfer to the widow but, under our provisions, she would be eligible for a personal discount. She would not be with the new tax proposed by the Opposition.</span></p>

Clause 19 provides an override to Crown exemption. For example, unoccupied police houses and judges' dwellings would have Crown exemption and the clause would override it.

That is why there is no need for a comparable Scottish provision. This is an English peculiarity, not a Scottish one.</span></p>

My hon. Friends have raised the issue of the equivalent, although quite different, appeals system in England and Wales. The valuation appeal committees were established to examine the valuation of domestic and non-domestic properties under the old rating system, which remains in relation to non-domestic properties. When a valuation was made by an assessor, anyone could appeal the decision to a valuation appeal committee. Appeals were about the value placed on a property by the assessor, not about banding or whether a dwelling should go before the tribunal for rating purposes. All buildings were put into one or other category—they were either domestic property or non-domestic property, and they were valued. Appeals were not about the amount of money that any one person should pay.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Clause 81(1)(b) allows a person to appeal on
<br><blockquote><p>"any calculation made by a levying authority of an amount which he is liable to pay to the authority in respect of council tax".</p></blockquote>

The Minister may assure us that that relates only to whether a house is in the right band. However, it could be interpreted to allow appeals in respect of discounts and rebates. If so, the valuation appeal committees are being asked to take on a new job that they do not have the experience to handle. Rebates and valuations are different matters. Will the Minister clarify what the committees are to do?<br><br>
At present, such committees include one layman who has no expertise on the subject. My father-in-law serves in that capacity. There is usually a lawyer and a chartered surveyor or someone with experience in property valuation. The appeal committees will need an accountant or someone experienced in financial matters to deal with the other aspects that the committees will have to consider. Whence will the expertise come to deal with this broadening of the committees' functions?<br><br>
How will the committees tackle the massive increase in the volume of work? The Government, naively, believe that there will not be many appeals against bandings. Our expert advice from assessors in Scotland suggests that people will appeal the banding and valuation of one third of all properties, and for two reasons: first, because they believe that they have been put in too high a band. Such people will want to reduce their local tax burden by being placed in the band below and will appeal on various grounds.<br><br>
Secondly, a few people will appeal that their property has been put in too low a band—especially if they are about to try to sell the property and are asking a price that would put the property in a higher band. Buyers could ask what council tax band the property was in and the seller would say that it was in band B. the buyer would then say that the house was being sold at a band C price and ask what the seller was up to.<br><br>
People will also appeal about the amount of money that they are asked to pay. Roughly one third of properties were the subject of appeals at the last revaluation in Scotland. There will be at least that number of appeals against banding. There will not be enough valuation appeal committees in Scotland to handle that volume of work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about the number of appeals and the people involved. It will be considerably worse under the fair rates system. There will be rolling revaluation and a corresponding number of rolling appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are appeals against the 1990 non-domestic revaluation. Appeals go on all the time; it makes no difference whether valuation is done once or on a rolling basis. Every property is revalued at some time and, as a result, there are ongoing appeals. That is not necssarily a bad thing; it means that there is constant checking of the valuation of properties and how the assessors do their job.<br><br>
I am anxious because there are insufficient committees to take on the extra role of handling appeals about the sums of money being asked for. The point about the discount is important; if one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
third of households may be liable for a discount, there will be a fair number of appeals against the local authority's decisions relating to students, for example, or households with a lodger. We must consider the number of committees that will be required.<br><br>
In Lothian there are four committees with a total of 24 people, and more in Strathclyde. Will the Minister say how many appeal committees there are? I do not believe there will be enough and thus my starred amendment, which specifies three months, will come into play. Will the decision be made within three months? It is important that it is, especially if people have to pay the full amount. If there is a successful appeal and the local authority has to refund money, will it be paid back with interest or be a straight repayment? If it is repaid within the three-month period there may be no need for interest payments but if the matter drags on for longer, people will be entitled to interest on the money that they may have lost.<br><br>
Conflicts of interest—I raised the matter earlier in terms of the English system—do not arise frequently in Scotland because the assessors, who are employed by local government, do the valuation. However, they are under pressure to take on extra people and to use private estate agents and surveyors to carry out some of the valuation work. If a company takes on the role of assessor by taking on some of his work for banding purposes, will any member of that company be on the valuation appeal committees? If so, there would be a conflict of interest.<br><br>
Will anyone who has taken part in the banding valuations or any member of his company be able to represent someone as a professional adviser at a valuation appeal committee? That, too, would be a conflict of interest.<br><br>
In Scotland, until now, there has been a clear division between the publicly employed assessor doing the job of valuation, and the private sector, representatives of which can sit on appeal committees and act for clients in appeals proceedings. That division has allowed valuations to be carried out in Scotland on a basis that most people consider fair. Once the private sector is allowed to operate on the valuation side, conflicts of interest will arise, which could be extremely damaging and could cause enormous problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most people's property will fall neatly in the middle of one of the bands, but there will be thousands of people whose property falls somewhere in the margins between bands. That is bound to give rise to appeals. Although not all appeals will go to a hearing—the problems may be resolved at an earlier stage through discussion—there will still be an enormous administrative workload to clear all the appeals. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, only a short time is available for problems to be resolved.<br><br>
It has been the practice in Scotland for valuation committees to deal only with valuations. All other difficulties go to a hearing—in the sheriff court, if necessary. The Government now propose that one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
committee should deal with all problems arising out of valuations, discounts and rebates. I have seen no publicity from the Scottish Office drawing attention to the proposed changes. Those are substantial changes which concern Opposition Members and senior people with many years' experience in assessors' departments. It is surprising that such major changes should occur without explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak briefly to the two amendments and to obtain clarification from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. I understand that the valuations will take place after the initial valuation at the time of sale. At that time, the value of the property is clearly determined in the open market. Its value will be what someone is willing to pay for it. The purchaser, knowing the value, will understand his commitment in respect of the council tax.<br><br>
Does my hon. Friend agree that a person's attitude will depend on whether he is a buyer or a seller? Anyone selling will want his property to be valued at the highest possible level. If the property cannot be sold, however, its value is irrelevant. If the market determines that the property is sold below its value, the final selling price is its realistic market value. As an increasing number of properties in Scotland are privately owned, the measurement of market value will become easier.<br><br>
Where properties are owned by local authorities or housing associations, the valuation will not be difficult to determine. As people have the right to buy, housing bodies know the value of their properties because they know what can be achieved.<br><br>
I am not as worried as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about the private sector becoming involved in valuation, because the private sector undertakes that work all the time. If the hon. Gentleman owns a property and has it insured, he will wisely take the advice of professionals who provide him with a valuation for insurance purposes, and that will be the cost, as they see it, of replacing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There would be a major difference between the valuation put on my house for insurance purposes and the valuation put on it if I were trying to sell it, or for banding purposes. A total replacement value for insurance purposes is completely different from other valuations.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that. Insurance is for replacement purposes whereas valuation is what people would be prepared to offer the hon. Gentleman for his property. If, like the rest of us, he is hoping to sell one day he will want it to be valued at the highest level. Much depends on whether one is a buyer or a seller. The market will ultimately determine the real value. That is a far better system than the arbitrary one that the hon. Gentleman supported which involved no end of appeals and distress for people because—and this was certainly my experience in Tayside—the regional assessors were authoritarian and unsympathetic. The hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
Gentleman will recall how I had to fight campaigns to change the regional assessors' views. That had to be done through legislation because, as often as not, being enterprising devils they were rating things that had never been rated before. It was therefore necessary to bring about changes. Adopting the system whereby a property is valued at the time it is sold is a logical and sensible way of proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is fairly clear and is accepted by hon. Members. It provides for appeals in respect of first, whether a property is a chargeable dwelling for council tax purposes, secondly, whether a person is liable for the tax and thirdly, the calculation of the amount of council tax, which can include an appeal against a refusal to award a discount. I was asked whether the appeal mechanism applies to rebates too. It does not. It applies to eligibility for discount but it is not intended that valuation appeal committees would take appeals on rebates. That would remain to be determined under the present system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that is the Minister's present assurance. As the clause is worded, however, it appears to give anyone who was in dispute with the local authority about his rebate the right to appeal. Subsection (1)(b) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"any calculation made by a levying authority of an amount which he is liable to pay to the authority".</p></blockquote>
That includes a rebate, in my view, and it might well be upheld by a sheriff if an appeal were made to him on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to be able to reassure the hon. Member on that point. It is a perfectly valid question to ask. It is not intended that valuation appeal committees would take appeals on rebates. Subsection (3) would permit appeals on rebates to be routed to DSS tribunals. I can reassure the hon. Member that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security is under a duty to consult formally the local authority associations on the draft council tax benefit regulations. He is also obliged to refer the draft regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee. There has already been informal consultation on this but the formal consultation will start as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. At that point the regulations on social security will be laid. That should make the system clear beyond any doubt.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) wanted to know whether valuation appeal committees would be able to cope; that was the essence of her point. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to that, too. As my hon. Friend suggested, people might appeal against a banding either way. People might want to appeal that their banding was too low if they were just about to sell their house.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North raised the matter of house valuations. It is clear that banding relates to the market or capital value of a house on a given date, the first date being 1 April 1991. That value is different from the insurance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
value, as I know from experience with my own house: the replacement value for insurance is substantially higher than the market value.<br><br>
It is important to stress that, in the past, valuation appeal committees handled domestic and non-domestic rates appeals. The hon. member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) made a point about outstanding appeals; we would expect to complete most non-domestic appeals on the 1990 revaluation before 1993. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be enough people to do that. The regulations allow for up to 60 members and we shall examine the need to strengthen the committees to deal with the new tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Government's intention that, in addition to dealing with the matters in subsection (1)(a), the valuation appeal committees will deal with banding and discounts in subsection (1)(b)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. The valuation appeal committee will decide whether the property is a chargeable dwelling, whether a person is liable and whether the calculation of the amount of council tax is correct—that can include discounts, but not rebates.<br><br>
As I said, the regulations allow for up to 60 members. We shall examine the need to strengthen the committees, to enable them to deal with the new tax. The resources that we have given local authorities to set up the new tax in Scotland are substantially greater than the amount that the authorities originally told us they would be likely to need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the valuation appeal committees should complete their non-domestic valuation appeals by 1993. However, from the expert advice that I have received, I would say that that is a slightly optimistic estimate. If it were accurate, it would mean that the committee would be dealing with appeals on banding in 1993 and would then deal with appeals on the next revaluation of non-domestic properties, which will be presumably be due in 1995.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The valuation appeal committees will have completed the appeals on non-domestic rates— many of which, as the hon. Gentleman will know, are extremely complicated—by 1993, when appeals on banding may be introduced. The process for appeals against banding is likely to be much more straightforward than that for many of the appeals for non-domestic rates. We do not know how many appeals—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that fascinating. Presumably, when someone appeals against a valuation banding, on a house that was not individually valued, but was simply grouped with other houses in the area, such a house will require an individual valuation by the assessor or by someone else. That will involve considerable extra work. Is my assumption correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is, but the system is much simpler than some of the appeals on, for example, petro-chemical complexes.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
The hon. Member for Cathcart also raised a valid point about conflicts of interest. I am glad to be able to place the answer clearly on the record. The problem must be seen against a background of the involvement of the private sector in the process of banding. That will be limited in Scotland because the job will be done by the assessors, although the private sector may be involved in some circumstances. Powers will be available to set out the rules for dealing with the problem. We shall certainly consult about the procedures to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since discounts are not a valuation matter, can the Minister tell the Committee why appeals about discounts will go to the valuation appeal committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A discount will be related to the nature of the household because this is a household tax. That is the basic justification. That is not true of rebates, so that appeal procedure will be subject to the consultations that will be held by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (5) of the clause states that neither section 1(3A) of the Lands Tribunal Act 1949 nor section 15 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1963 will apply. If someone goes to the valuation appeal committee and gets an unsatisfactory decision, he has at present, the right to appeal to the lands tribunal. That is fine for appeals on the banding process. However, will people have the right to appeal to the lands tribunal about problems with the discount? My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) raised that point earlier. When it was a question of the amount of money paid, in the past, the appeal would have been to the sheriff and not to a valuation appeal committee or lands tribunal. What will the role of the sheriff be? What will be the division of responsibility? Or will there be no appeal on the discount beyond the valuation appeal committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair point. Appeals may be about issues other than valuation, such as the discount. That is why it is appropriate that appeals should be to the Court of Session rather than to the land valuation appeal court. The appeal procedure on a point of law will be to the Court of Session.</span></p>

Schedule 2</div> <!-- schedule -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ADMINISTRATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 83, line 25, leave out "solely".<br><br>
Schedule 2 deals with the administrative functions of local government. Paragraph 2 deals specifically with the collection of the council tax; sub-paragraph (1)(a) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"any reference to the liable person is a reference to a person who is solely liable to pay to an authority".</p></blockquote>
I wish to draw on the experience that local authorities have had with the collection of local taxes. The former rating system was widely recognised as simple to administer, and collection was cheap. In the latter years of that system, about £200 was collected at a cost of £17.8 million. The collection rate was 99 per cent.<br><br>
We also have records of the collection rate under the current system. Last year, about £500 million was spent on collecting £24 million in poll tax and business rates, which amounted to a collection rate of about 90 per cent. Paragraph 2 is crucial to the collection of the council tax.<br><br>
Will the Minister clarify why the word "solely" is included in the provision? Council tax will be due from residents who are top of the hierarchy of liability. In many circumstances, more than one person could be responsible for the payment of the tax—for example, a couple covered by the joint and several liability provision. Will paragraph 2 apply only when there is one liable person in the dwelling? If so, the word "solely" is directly only to that one person. Sub-paragraph 3(2) covers people who are jointly and severally liable. The reference to a sole person in the earlier provision differs from what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
is contained under the joint and several liability provision. Will the Minister explain that difference?<br><br>
Will billing authorities be able to send out single bills in the names of several residents and recover unpaid council tax from either of those who are covered by the joint and several liability provision? Or will local authorities have to canvass each household in advance to establish who the sole liable person is, and subsequently set up a register of such people? What procedures will authorities be required to adopt when there is more than one liable person in a dwelling? How does the word "solely" apply in that case?<br><br>
The information that I seek is urgently needed by local authorities so that they can set up their collection and billing procedures. It is also important to settle who is responsible for the collection of the council tax. On that issue, I refer to the information that members of the Committee have received from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It has catalogued a list of the main problems to do with non-payment of the poll tax which citizens advice bureaux have investigated.<br><br>
This is another minor amendment, but it is important to know who will be responsible for paying the council tax in households of more than one person.<br><br>
I have put several questions to the Minister to which I hope that he will respond so that those in local government considering setting up the collection services for the council tax will have an idea of what lies behind the schedule's reference to the word "solely". Does that apply to dwellings of one person? If it applies to more than one person, how will that affect the joint and several liability provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although legislation is not always straightforward to read when it has been drafted, I think that we have become accustomed to reading one paragraph with another. Therefore, my briefest answer is that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) should read paragraph 2 of schedule 2 with paragraph 3. Paragraph 2 deals with cases in which there is a sole liable person and paragraph 3 deals with cases in which amendment to the general principle of a sole liable person is required in cases of joint and several liability. The Committee has already given an airing to the subject of joint and several liability— indeed, we have discussed it at some length.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right in that under paragraphs 2 and 3 what is to be applied is the hierarchy of liability to tax, which we debated under clause 6. By applying that hierarchy, we will find either that one person in a household is solely liable or possibly that more than one person shares joint and several liability for the payment of the tax.<br><br>
As a pratical matter, I believe that if the local authority has no record of the person whom it regards as liable, it can send its bill to the council taxpayer, or some other description that it thinks fit. In the same way, rates bills were often sent to "The Occupier" without the person being named. If the rates bill was not paid, the local authority then took
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0296">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
steps to discover who the liable person was so that enforcement procedures could be taken.<br><br>
Similarly, if there is no response to the bill sent to the council taxpayer, the local authority will doubtless make inquiries about who the liable person is. It may discover, in line with paragraph 2, that the liable person is a person solely responsbile, or, as in paragraph 3, that there is joint and several liability for the tax and so decide to pursue one or other, or both in the case of two liable people.<br><br>
The principles are not very different. As I explained last week in reply to an amendment, even the principle of joint and several liability was not a novelty that arrived with the community charge; it developed from case histories at the time of the rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we agree that there is no point in going back on our earlier debate, but we said then that joint and several liability made some sense for a household liability such as the rates imposed, but looked insupportable in principle for an allegedly personal tax such as the poll tax. The problems with joint and several liability under the council tax arise in connection with the personal element, which has been retained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes; although I did not accept the hon. Gentleman's argument, I understood how it arose with particular force in the case of the community charge when each person's bill was a personal bill. Some people had doubts about joint and several liability for bills that were in the names of other people. I explained the cases that particularly worried us. We should provide the opportunity to pursue the person in the best position to pay the bills—even under the community charge, for which there was joint and several liability.<br><br>
The point of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has little application to the council tax. We shall send out one bill per household. The amount will vary, depending on the composition of the household. There may be nobody resident, one person resident, or two or more people resident. With a single household bill and the adult residents contributing to its size, I have no difficulty with the concept of joint and several liability. But perhaps that is not too surprising because I was not uncomfortable with it under the community charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that in our earlier debate we raised the issue of the heartlessness and illogicality of making a disregarded person liable under the joint and several liability proposals. We were thinking particularly of somebody suffering from Alzheimer's disease, for example. We could see the logic, however unattractive, of making a person who was exempt from the personal element jointly and severally liable for the property element. However, it seemed totally illogical to make the person exempted from personal liability on his or her own account liable for the personal element of somebody else. At the time, the Minister had no answer to that problem of logic. Has he thought of an answer in the intervening period?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I had one then, but I may not have offered it when the hon. Gentleman wanted me to. There will be joint and several liability only if two or more people stand equally in the heirarchy described in clause 6. I was thinking of the example of a man with Alzheimer's disease who owned a property and, being of an old-fashioned disposition, had all the money within the marriage. The proposition that there should not be joint and several liability seemed to open up the possibility that his wife, who might not have any money but who might be co-owner of the property, would be held solely liable, according to the amendment. By contrast, the property's real owner, even though severely mentally impaired, would not be liable at all.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Given that we have no way of knowing whether a person's assets would be transferred away from him simply because he is severely mentally impaired— and given also that we cannot dictate that—it is possible that that person would not be liable, even though he had means and could be considered to be the owner. However, the amendment would mean that, his wife, who might have no means, would become solely liable.<br><br>
The amendment seems to open no new ground. The old rating system had no special provision for the severely mentally impaired. I remember that I pointed out to the hon. Member for Dagenham that we were dealing with a matter of logic and law, in which the practicalities might be somewhat different. The assets of a severely mentally impaired person almost certainly would be managed by someone else, who would in a sense be the object of physical pursuit for the repayment. Even so, we do not have the right to say that a severely mentally impaired person should be dismissed from having liability. The assets might still rest with that person, regardless of how they are administered. The administration of such assets is entirely a private matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for lingering over this point, although it would be good to find a way past it. What he has said is persuasive— in logic, if not in justice or equity—in relation to liability for the property element. However, he does not see the illogicality of exempting someone from personal liability because he or she falls into one of the disregarded categories established in schedule 1— that person would then become invisible, to use the Minister's word, for the purposes of liability, at least in respect of that personal element—and then making him or her liable from someone else's personal liability? I should regret it if the Minister were to insist that the 50 per cent property tax should be paid, but I could understand the logic. I cannot see the logic in what he proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's position. The difference between us is that I regard the bill that is sent to a household as consisting of both property and personal elements, whatever the sum of the personal elements may be. Let us take the example of a married couple in which the husband has Alzheimer's disease but is the owner of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0297">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
property. That household would be composed of a property element and a sum of personal elements. The sum of the personal elements happens to be zero plus one, making a total of one. However, the bill is still a household bill and one of the liable people in this example would be the husband—the person with Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>
There is no inconsistency in saying that that household's bill is made up in part by a discount for the husband but that he may be rightfully held jointly and severally liable for the total household bill. I contrast that example with the example of a student living with his single parent. That student would enjoy a discount but would not be jointly and severally liable, since it is unlikely that he would be the property's joint owner. The difference is that he does not come at the top of the hierarchy for liability under clause 6, whereas the severely mentally impaired person who is the owner of a property does. That means that that severely mentally impaired person becomes one of the people who is jointly and severally liable, even though he is in receipt of the personal discount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to argue the case for joint and several liability on the grounds that it existed under the rates and under the poll tax. But a major shift has taken place. Under the rates and the poll tax, joint and several liability related to married couples or couples living together as if they were married. I have no responsibility under law for my 19-year-old son's poll tax; that is a matter for him. I am jointly and severally responsible for my wife's poll tax and that is all. The Minister is shifting this liability to a broader ground so that joint and several liability can include more people than husbands and wives.<br><br>
The Minister used the example of a husband and wife, one of whom has Alzheimer's disease, but it may involve a brother or sister, or one of two sisters. Suddenly they will be jointly and severally liable for the tax, whereas they were not in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that I am proposing that, for example, a brother and sister who are co-owners of a property and stand equally in the liability hierarchy under clause 6 could be jointly and severally liable, but I believe that that offers protection. The Opposition regard it as heartlessness to pursue someone who is severely mentally impaired. That is inconsistent with their general view that we should consider people's means rather than put them into categories.<br><br>
Let me put to the hon. Gentleman a plausible case of a brother and sister who are co-owners of a house— the house has been entered in their co-names. The brother who suffers from Alzheimer's is a person of means; the sister is not. Under the Opposition's proposals we should have to regard the sister without means as the solely liable person purely on the ground that her brother is severely mentally impaired, notwithstanding the fact that the brother had means, which are presumably being administered by someone, not necessarily the sister, perhaps by a son or a trustee. Unless joint and several liability is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
extended to severely mentally impaired people, the logic of the Opposition's argument is that we would pursue people who might not be in a strong position to make the payment, whereas we could be pursuing someone in a stronger position, albeit that the practical consequence would be that we should be pursuing the people who were administering the assets of a person who was severely mentally impaired.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the practical argument that the Government, on behalf of local government, are anxious to get their hands on the money, but we are trying to direct attention to the logic of the argument. It is sometimes difficult to follow what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but to defend his position, I think that he was attempting to draw distinctions between different groups or pairs of people according to where they are in the hierarchy and—although he did not make this point—according to whether they fall under clause 6 or clause 9 for the purposes of joint and several liability.<br><br>
The Minister also made a point that turned on the probability of certain relationships. The probability of the student and a spouse living together is quite high, as is the probability of a student and another person living together as joint tenants or joint owners under clause 6. We cannot dismiss them as unlikely eventualities. But in the case of a brother and sister, a married couple or cohabitees where one member has Alzheimer's, liability depends on residence, and that is more uncertain, as we shall discover when we debate schedule 2.<br><br>
The Minister is logic chopping. He is hopping from one clause to another, one category to another, one concept to another—whether it be residence or ownership—to justify his position on the ground that he always wants to pursue the person who is most able to pay the bill. I accept that that would sometimes be the person suffering from Alzheimer's disease whose estate is being managed by somebody else, but he has not dealt with the logical problem that I put to him in the first place of exempting someone from personal liability but then making him liable for someone else's personal liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I was chopping. I was trying to establish in the hon. Gentleman's mind that qualification for a discount and liability to the tax are separate issues. If a person were exempt from the tax, he would frequently be liable for no tax. I cited the case of students. The student who is not at the top of the hierarchy under clause 6 within a property will not be liable to the tax. People at the top of the hierarchy—whether they have an exemption— will be potentially jointly and severally liable only.<br><br>
I return to the severely mentally impaired, but I cannot do more than reiterate my argument. I regard people of equal liability in the hierarchy under clauses 6 or 9 to be in receipt of a bill for the household and to be liable for it jointly and severally, no matter how that bill is derived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an assertion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly the policy that we are pursuing. Howsoever the household bill arises, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0298">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
shall identify the liable person—he might be solely liable under paragraph 2 of schedule 2, or jointly and severally liable under paragraph 3. I have explained why there would be great difficulties for people if we were to return to the spirit of the Opposition's earlier amendment and exclude the severely mentally impaired from liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister about the connection between paragraphs 1 and 2 of schedule 2. I accept that notices about the rates were sent to the occupier, and I see no reason to change that. I am intrigued that the Minister said that "solely" was included in paragraph 2 because it refers to single occupiers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that was the point that the Minister made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is becoming rather tautological, but it refers those who are solely liable. It is about not how many people live in a property, but how many people are liable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that we should read paragraph 1 in conjunction with paragraph 2. He also said that a married couple or a couple who cohabit will be jointly and severally liable. The records will show that the Minister referred to single occupiers as being solely liable. However, the Minister now says that bills could be sent to a household in which more than one person lives, none of whom is jointly and severally liable. Therefore, how will the charging authority identify the person who is solely liable to pay? To address it to the solely liable person means nothing. Unless the person responsible is identified in the first instance, the bill could float around the dwelling, especially if the dwelling were owned by someone who was absent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or a garage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. If the dwelling were owned by a someone who was absent and were a rented property, the person living in it would be responsible for the charge. That was established earlier. If three of four people are living in the dwelling, who will be solely liable? Is it necessary for the authority to establish a register? Will the Minister tell the Committee how a local authority will identify a person who is solely liable?</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By all means. There may not be a person who is solely liable but people who are jointly and severally liable. I shall take an example.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that he lived with his 19-year-old son. Let us suppose that a bill is sent to the hon. Gentleman's house. It may be addressed to the council tax payer. If, after some time, the council receives no response another letter will be sent reminding the hon. Gentleman that he has not paid
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
the bill and, possibly, after that another letter will arrive saying that as no payment has been made it will be helpful to know whether an owner-occupier is in residence and, if not, whether a tenant is living there. The hon. Gentleman being, in this instance, forgetful but not wishing to break the law, will at once reply saying that he is the owner-occupier. "Ah", the local authority will say, "The hon. Member for Cathcart is the person who is liable to pay this bill."<br><br>
If it turns out that the hon. Member for Cathcart is married, there will be joint and several liability. If it transpires that the hon. Gentleman was not the owner-occupier but a tenant, he might be the solely liable person. If he were married, he would probably enjoy joint and several liability. He might be sharing the tenancy with someone else, in which case they might be jointly and severally liable tenants for council tax purposes. Or it might be discovered that the hon. Gentleman was the owner-occupier but that he owned the property jointly with his sister. In that case they would both fall jointly in the hierarchy.<br><br>
Ascertaining those details would be unnecessary if, as I imagine would be the case, the hon. Member for Cathcart sent off his cheque by return of post, in which case a cheque would have arrived from the property and that would be the end of the matter. The local authority would have no need to know any more about it, such as whether the hon. Gentleman was claiming a single person discount. That is the end of the matter as far as the local authority is concerned.<br><br>
The local authority would need to pursue the matter further to try to identify a person as being solely or jointly and severally liable to pay the bill only in the event of non-payment, which would not arise in the case of the hon. Member for Cathcart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my name has been taken in vain, let me carry the examples further. Let us suppose that in a few years from now I have retired and my wife and I decide to go on a six-month cruise as part of my retirement celebrations. If we leave my 24 or 25-year-old son, who is still a student, in the house by himself and I have forgotten to pay the local tax bill, will my son become liable? If so, will he get a discount?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would venture an opinion. In the light of the Anderton judgment, the departure of the hon. Gentleman and his wife on a cruise, even for a period as long as six months, would not lead anyone to conclude that he had ceased to be resident at his property. If he had left behind his considerable wardrobe—his glorious selection of suits and ties— and his pet dog, Rover, it would suggest that he had not ceased to be resident at his property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Committee that my wife would not allow any dog, except me, in the house.<br><br>
If someone goes abroad to work on a short-term contract for six or nine months, or a year, takes his wife with him but leaves a young adult in the house, who is liable to pay the tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to say that that would be a matter for the courts. The hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0299">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
mentioned three periods of time: six months, nine months and a year. The time spent abroad could be a material fact. It might be considered material to deciding whether the couple had established another residence elsewhere. Their intentions when they left the country, whether they had made it clear that they meant to return and whether the property was let during their absence might be considered. Those factors could help a court to decide whether a person was resident in the property. In the first instance, of course, a local authority council tax registration officer would deal with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schedule highlights the problems posed by the collection of the council tax. We are told that a bill will be sent to the person solely liable to pay the tax, unless someone is jointly and severally liable. The Minister gave several examples of joint and several liability. To avoid the wrath of charge payers, the local authority would have to state whether it intended to notify a sole liable person, or people who were jointly and severally liable. Otherwise, people would argue about who was responsible for paying the bill. The problems caused by the poll tax could arise with the council tax: people could deny responsibility and refuse to pay. The rating system was easier. The bill was sent to the occupier, who was registered on the valuation list. Tenants would accept the terms of the valuation list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman meant to say that the names of occupiers, appeared on the valuation lists under the rating system. If that were the case, the list would have constituted a register. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to imply that there were registers under the rating system. Local authorities would address bills to "the occupier". Perhaps, over a period of time, they realised that the occupiers of one house were called Mr. and Mrs Smith and chose to address the bill by name. However, if local authorities received no response to a bill, they had to identify a liable person.<br><br>
It is more difficult to establish the identity of the occupier than that of the resident. The bill sets a simpler task: that of identifying residents with the hierarchies that are set out in clause 6. Under the rating system, tests had to be applied to discover the identity of the occupier. However, the principle is the same—if responses are not received to bills, local authorities have to find the liable person. The only difference is that the council tax deals with residents rather than occupiers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all aware that there used to be a register—the rating register—which was kept in the finance department or town hall. It was a property and valuation register. I do not understand how there cannot be one under the council tax. There will have to be a system for finance departments to identify what people's circumstances are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman, he says that there was a register that included people's names and addresses. "Fair Rates" is based on rates. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that there would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
be a rating register with names and addresses under the rates system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that the rating system always involved a property register. The council tax will require a property register. The rating register did not list the number of people in a property but over time people were identified with a particular property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of clarifying the point, which seems to confuse the Minister, does my hon. Friend agree that the property register did not list the names of all those who lived in a property, and that no attempt was made to link liability with those people? Liability did not vary according to the number or identity of the people who occupied a property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point. The Government's approach, with people being solely liable, is similar to that adopted over the poll tax. Further problems will emanate from the Bill, as they did from the Local Government Finance Act 1988. All that we can do is to place on record our anxiety about the problems that will develop in collecting the council tax. The Minister is weaving around to try to substantiate the use of "solely". I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 134, in schedule 2, page 83, line 39, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(ba) Regulations under this Schedule made in accordance with paragraph 2(b) above shall provide that, where a liable person so requests, payments on account shall be accepted at weekly or fortnightly intervals;".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that I shall be able to speak more slowly than on the previous occasion when I attempted to address the Committee and shall not try to set a record for the number of words per minute.<br><br>
Amendment No. 134 is an opportunity for all three parties to unite. It is full of common sense, it is straightforward and cost-effective for local authorities, and it is fair. It is fair because it goes to the root of an individual's ability to meet his or her financial liability. People having difficulty paying their council tax would be able to pay in weekly or fortnightly instalments.<br><br>
The citizens advice bureaux, with other worthy organisations, have considered the detail of the Bill and given us advice that we should examine carefully. The bureaux are worried about rising debt and they, of all voluntary organisations, have the greatest experience of meeting people who have difficulties paying their way. It helps no one when a person gets into arrears. It compounds that person's problems and prevents local authorities from obtaining the money to which they are entitled. Without that money, authorities cannot pay for essential services that individuals and groups in the community need. Arrears help no one. We should do everything possible to avoid people getting into arrears with

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
their payments. The experience of citizens advice bureaux, and other organisations, of people with poll tax debt is that they are not wilful non-payers, but people who find it difficult to cope with their expenses on a tight, limited budget.</span></p>
