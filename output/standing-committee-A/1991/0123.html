	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF HARBOURS ACT 1964</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [21 January],</i> That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned on Tuesday, I was explaining what I considered to be the real implications of schedule 3.I said that clause 57—the trigger clause for the powers—would transform the scope of the harbours orders made since the passing of the Harbours Act 1964. Anyone looking at that Act would not see some of the subsections referred to in schedule 3, because they were part of subsequent Acts that amended the 1964 Act. We are not just talking about consolidated procedure; I do not know how many Acts are involved—it will be many—so perhaps the Minister, with the help of his experts, could enlighten us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1(3) could mean the virtual closing of a harbour. It refers to the closing of "part of the harbour", but closing part—perhaps 85 per cent.—can have far-reaching effects, as can the changing of facilities, the disposal of property and the inclusion of uses for leisure, other than sea-going ships for cargo or passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4(c) contains what to any parliamentarian is a most objectionable feature—a provision for the modification of
	<br><blockquote><p>"any Act or of any instrument made under any Act".</p></blockquote>
That is any Act of Parliament—general, private or whatever. That is, by any account a tremendous increase in scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that was recommended by the Select Committee, to bring legislation into line with the concept that private harbour Bills should come within the scope of the Act and be transferred to the statutory instrument procedure. The statutory instrument procedure, which we discussed under part I of the Bill, is complicated enough, but is not schedule 3 even more complicated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision would transform the statutory basis of some 600 harbours and ports in the United Kingdom. I accept that many of them are not like Tilbury, Southampton, what is left of Newcastle, Greenock, Glasgow or any of the medium or small ports that are still operative. King's Lynn is an example of a port that has been kept going by ingenious mechanisation. They are usually small harbours, which were significant in the past and are still significant for leisure, recreation and the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coastal areas are often renowned for their scenery, and include mudflats and many sites of special scientific interest. By their nature, many ancient ports and harbours are sensitive to the relationship between human beings, human endeavours, earlier industrial and navigational techniques and the natural environment. Consequently,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
great loyalties are felt, not only by people who have lived there—perhaps for generations—but by those who visit those ports and harbours or navigate around them. I do not know whether private Acts cover harbours such as Padstow, Barnstaple and Rye or those on the east coast ports in Essex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, does the Bill cover Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. That means that the scope of the schedule is enormous because the west coast of Scotland is full of such harbours. I do not know whether those Scottish ports and harbours are covered by private Acts; presumably the 600 ports and harbours are within the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the schedule gives no protection to fishermen. Although inshore fishing is not what it was, it is still important and should be retained. That important economic activity requires the use of quays and parts of harbours, even though the economic return and the rents that fishermen can pay may be less than might be achieved if the use of the harbour and quay were changed. The position is similar to that of boat builders on the River Thames and elsewhere, who are suffering because riverside land is in demand for flats and houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who are familiar with recent general legislation will know that strong feelings have been aroused about changes affecting Poole. They may think that everything is all right because that harbour has been covered by an Act of Parliament dating from the time of Edward III, which was updated during Queen Victoria's reign. Hon. Members may think that it is also covered by the Harbours Act 1964, but that protection will disappear on the stroke of midnight on the day that the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Joint Committee decided to chuck in the harbours for good measure, did it consider the implications? When the Minister replies, will he say whether my comments—including those I made on Tuesday—are more or less correct? Is the picture that I am painting exaggerated? Am I right about the change of status and the surprises that may be in store for people who believe that they are secure and entrenched by Acts of Parliament? Previously, such people could petition against any harbours order or private Act that would change the balance that a local authority wanted. That will no longer be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone who got wind of change—there may be people who wish to develop harbours for all sorts of purposes—could protest to a Member of Parliament, who could assure him that he was covered by an Act. That is no longer true. In the old 1930s style, the man in the bowler hat will be able to tell such people that under section 57 of the Transport and Works Act 1992—and in particular, schedule 3 of that Act—their facilities can be reduced. That is what the law will be. That is the procedure that the Committee is being asked to substitute for the existing harbours orders or a new private Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cross-arrangements and powers in the Bill are not obvious, even to those of us with experience of reading Bills. Does the power of the Secretary of State to pass over to another person the power to deal with those matters operate in such a case or, in respect of clause 57, are those matters entirely for the Minister to deal with under the Harbours Act 1964? I suspect that the power to delegate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
does not apply in those circumstances because it is rooted in an amendment to the Harbours Act 1964 rather than in the principal Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A scheme would have to be in the form of a draft statutory instrument under the Harbours Act 1964, in the same way as the promoter of a railway would have to produce a draft scheme under clauses 1 and 2. That scheme would have to be put to the Minister. Such an instrument, although not as long or comprehensive, would have to be equivalent to a private Bill to amend the statutes of a harbour. I doubt whether the Bill is intended to expunge all the private Acts and replace them with something else. We are not dealing with new construction, such as a cross-rail. If that measure is not approved during the present Session, it may come under the procedure that we are discussing. We are dealing with the amendment of existing Acts. Presumably, schedule 3 and the statutory instrument under the Harbours Act would amend the hundreds of Acts that entrench the powers and uses of harbours as they stand today. That process will be complicated, and any such schemes will have to be put to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect, and I think that it would be fair to say, that the change in the scope and the procedure—the two go together for harbours—could release all sorts of ideas. Therefore, I suggest that it is likely—I do not say guaranteed—that there will be greater activity on that front than at present. That is almost inevitable because the scope of variation and the means of attaining it are different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition—and we know this well—there will be a number of light railway and, possibly, railway orders, some of which may be complex, such as that on the fast link. If this Bill is passed, we shall have to use this procedure to deal with the issue of the fast link halfway to the channel tunnel. All that will be done within the bosom of the Department of Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page v of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to handle additional orders the Department of Transport will require 3–4 extra staff."</p></blockquote>
Is that realistic? I realise that that statement is not part of the Bill's Provisions. Surely three to four staff, at least, would be needed to deal with the harbour orders, let alone the railway, light railway and tramway orders that may appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work that is currently carried out in the Private Bill Office of this House—or of the other place—on the scope of such Bills will be transferred to the Department of Transport. Page v of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum confirms that. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be an increase in the number of planning inspectors and their support staff of up to 10 man years."</p></blockquote>
That is probably a little optimistic. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be some staff savings in Parliament. Part II of the Bill will have minimal effects on public service manpower."</p></blockquote>
I am not so sure about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will have to be a good deal of expansion in various parts of the Department of Transport, which will not be central to that Department as much of the work will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
be legal. I shall take much persuading that the expansion will equal the reduction in the Clerk's department of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, I have had a fair bit to do with the Clerk's department—perhaps more than some Members, but not necessarily so—in various capacities: as a petitioner, as a Member of a private Bill Committee, as a Chairman and in relation to the successful introduction of instructions on the Floor of the House. My admiration for the efficiency and expertise of the Clerks is considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the matter does not simply involve Clerks. They act as advisers. They sit as a board of examiners, which is appointed by this House to examine Bills. Other stand-by bodies occasionally meet—for example, the Court of Referees, in the context of locus standi and so on. Often, it need not meet for long; it is served well by briefing from learned Clerks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there are the staff, with expertise accumulated over many years, of the parliamentary agents. I have met quite a number of them. They are not part of a statutory, but they perform an important and valuable function. I do not speak on their behalf. Indeed, if one were writing a novel or a play, one could no doubt introduce a good deal of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Our very efficient Public Bill Office is wonderful in that respect. It is admirable that three or four people in a single room along the Corridor handle most of that work of the House, probably without the aid of electronics. The parliamentary agents have been there for—to use a slang phrase—yonks. They have enormous experience. It is a lifetime's career. Private Bill work in the House can also be a lifetime's career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there are the Standing Orders of private business, which I suspect many hon. Members have not even seen, let alone read. The latest edition has no fewer than 165 pages. It is relevant to harbours and to schedule 3 because anybody wishing to take advantage of the new powers that the House is being asked to provide in the Bill would have to take account of the Standing Orders. They are a handbook for the promoters of private Bills and the agents whom they employ. They do not always have to employ someone because an individual can promote a simple one or two-clause Bill. The handbook has been built up over the centuries. The Standing Orders are not perfect and there are many changes that could improve them, especially on which type of Bill should be designated private Bills, hybrid Bills or more suitable for general legislation. That would require only a couple of lines in the private business rules. It has not been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen under a harbours order? The Standing Orders will go out of the window, as will any matter dealt with under clauses 1 and 3. I suspect that the Department of Transport and the Minister, who will have powers to make rules for applications, will try to at least parallel the handbook and give the same protection to citizens. In the future, an hon. Member from any party, may have a harbour order on his local harbour, over which there is a row in his constituency, and he may wish to have an Adjournment debate about it. What will the Minister say? It may be the Minister who has to reply, but after the election it may be my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), and I hope that it is. Will the Minister have to say that he cannot do anything about the matter because it is the responsibility of the Secretary of State and the inspector, as set out in the legal flummery and rules and regulations? Why will that be so? It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
because Parliament, in its wisdom or unwisdom, will have passed the Transport and Works Act 1992. The Minister will have to say, "Sorry mate, I cannot do anything about it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You are probably thinking, Mr. Latham—what on earth can this fellow dredge up next? It is this: ports and harbours often have roads, railways and tramways. Developers may propose a new estate over the hill from the harbour, which would be reasonably accessible, or a light rapid transport system, a tram system, a new railway or the re-opening of a railway. All those would require parliamentary powers under existing legislation. More likely, perhaps, developers may propose extending or dredging an old river or re-opening a canal. Canals are subject to private Bills, too. There are still arguments in various parts of the country about abandoned canals and the Acts of Parliament still on the statute book. Developers may propose a lock or a barrage. Which part of the Bill will cover such decisions? They may be covered by clause 3, which we discussed and which will apply, for example, to barrages in the Severn or the Mersey. Other decisions—for example, about a barrage in a small port, the extension of a canal or the construction of a marina basin—may be covered by clauses 3 and 5. I imagine that parliamentary agents will open branches and have consultants to provide expertise for applicants. Two sorts of document may have to be deposited: those that are required for an application under clause 3, and those that are required by the obscure succession of legislation for which the Government are seeking approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any decent citizen of this country, if he thought that he was being done down by a loophole in the system, would seek judicial review. Members of the Committee have realised over the past few days that there is considerable scope for attempting to put a spanner in the works, especially with harbours legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, one could revise Standing Orders so that private Bills that were not necessary could be filtered out and perhaps change the operation of private Bill Committees—we are all aware of the abuses and difficulties from which that system suffers at present. The revised system, which need not be expensive, could achieve a better result, which would be built on existing parliamentary structures. The control of harbours would be kept within the hands of the House, as it has been for centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Committee's sittings, I have become increasingly worried. I do not believe that the Bill's implications—let alone its complications and ambiguities—have been understood by the Joint Committee. That Committee took only the convenience of Parliament into account. The Bill will require additional office space for its administration. It will also involve more complicated procedures, greater departmental work and increased ministerial responsibility in Whitehall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill was welcomed by the House on Second Reading. I am not sure that the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) was aware of its contents. We have been at pains to explain that many people find the present private Bill procedure satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report was produced after much consultation. There was much pressure for it, not least from Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
The Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure recommended that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the permitted scope of Harbour Orders under the Harbours Act 1964 should be broadened so as to allow general powers to be included and a wider range of developments to be authorised".</p></blockquote>
That was contained in recommendation 9. The Committee mentioned in particular the authorisation of recreational harbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harbour orders can already be used for many matters in connection with harbours. There are some matters where it is not clear how much can be done by a harbour order which need clarification, and some matters which clearly fall outside the scope of harbour orders but which are essentially of local significance and are capable of being dealt with under the harbour order procedures, with safeguards for objectors to make their point and, if those objections are sustained, for a public inquiry before the Minister reaches a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 3 implements the Government's response to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South referred to the criteria that the Minister must apply when considering an HRO. These have been expanded in specific respects. They do not give the Minister carte blanche. First, it is made clear in paragraph 1(2) of the schedule that matters relating to the recreational use of a harbour can be dealt with by a harbour revision order. This implements the specific reference in the report of the Joint Committee to the desirability of making provision for recreational harbours, including marinas, in the harbour order procedures. A similar provision is made in paragraph 2(2) to amend section 16 of the 1964 Act, which covers harbour empowerment orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we will also make it possible in paragraph 1(3) of schedule 3 for a harbour revision order to be made which provides for some diminution in harbour facilities. Strictly speaking, this could not be regarded as meeting the criteria in section 14(2)(b) of the 1964 Act. The Minister must be satisfied that the provisions are nevertheless desirable and this must be seen in the context of section 14 as a whole. The matters which can be dealt with in this way are the closure of part of a harbour, a reduction in the facilities or the disposal of property not required for the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be possible to seek powers for the complete closure of a harbour under this provision. That would involve the consequential dismantling of the regulatory navigational and conservation functions of the harbour authority which have generally been conferred by Parliament. We consider that a proposal to close a harbour completely should be a matter for Parliament to decide rather than the Secretary of State. A harbour authority will not be able to get rid of its statutory regulatory functions by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, section 14(3) of the 1964 Act permits the inclusion of provisions
	<br><blockquote><p>"requisite or expedient for rendering of full effect a provision of the order framed to achieve any of the said objects"—</p></blockquote>
those set out in schedule 2 to the Act or in subsection (2A), which covers the repeal of an obsolete or otherwise unnecessary local provision. Paragraph 1(4)(a) of the schedule replaces the words quoted with
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other provisions of the order".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0806">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
This is intended to cover the case where provisions are included dealing with the reduction of harbour facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, section 14(3) of the 1964 Act permits the inclusion of supplementary, consequential or incidental provisions
	<br><blockquote><p>"requisite or expedient for the purposes of the order".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 1(4)(b) of the schedule brings section 14(3) into line with the similar provisions in section 16(6) which covers harbour empowerment orders. This will remove all ambiguity and make it clear that there is no additional constraint on harbour revision orders which might, for example, prevent the inclusion of safeguards for environmental matters in a harbour revision order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1964 Act provides for the inclusion of provisions repealing or amending provisions in local Acts. Paragraph 1(4) of the schedule widens the power to enable the order to disapply or modify the application of general statutes, but not to repeal or amend them. Harbour revision orders, unlike private Bills, cannot be used to modify or disapply provisions in general Acts or subordinate legislation of general application, except in the special case of section 43(3) of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a harbour authority may wish to disapply the general development order for the purposes of a harbour revision order, as sometimes happens in a private Act, and to deal with the planning authority on the development as a whole, instead of relying on the GDO for some parts and planning permission for others. The effect of paragraph l(4)(b) will be to give greater flexibility, especially where part of a proposed development is subject to normal planning permission, such as with recreational harbours where there might be a related housing scheme. It must make sense to have a single inquiry where the subject matter is linked like that. In that situation, the local authority and the Secretary of State will want to look at the whole scheme. They will not want the GDO to apply to some parts if that does not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other legislation of general application which it is relevant to modify or disapply in the circumstances of an individual harbour order. A similar provision will appear in part I of the Bill when clause 5(3) is amended on Report. Applicants would have to satisfy the appropriate Minister that any such modification or disapplication was relevant to the particular purposes of the order and he would have to satisfy himself that it did not override safeguards established by Parliament to protect the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments to the Harbours Act 1964 are intended to do what the joint committee asked for by making specific changes to ensure that harbour orders are capable of dealing with a wider range of matters, which hitherto have been dealt with in private Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes more sense and local people understand the implications far better. Setting up the order procedure, doing away with locus standi rules, and allowing people to make representations at local level—rather than having to come to London with all the ramifications of possible silks is the best way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South also spoke about a watering down of the role of a Member of Parliament. Yet a Member of Parliament who is dealing with a controversial issue in his local constituency is best able to represent constituents in a number of different ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliamentary agents often promote HROs and we expect that they will be involved in the order procedures
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
under part I. I do not envisage any drastic ending of the roles of Members of Parliament or parliamentary agents. Overall, the schedule meets the requirements that the House wanted. Of course, it is never possible to please and satisfy everybody, but the schedule embodies a general approach to how these problems should be considered. I am sure that it will improve the position both for the House and for those who want to object. I hope therefore that the Committee will allow the schedule to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have detained the Committee over-long, so I shall be brief. May I surprise the Minister by acknowledging that I wholly agree with many of his final remarks? One of my constituents was advised that he had to spend £70,000 and risk that amount to save his business by petitioning Parliament. He lived in London and thought it would be 20 minutes on the District line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing to prevent private Bill procedure from being changed to require Bills to be considered only after local planning permission or any other prior local inquiry—as ordered by Parliament or a Minister—has been completed. In other words, the entire procedure should be as local as possible. That covers much of the objection. I object—I know that I may be unpopular for saying it—to the fact that this change has been based on the convenience of the legislators rather than protection of the citizen. That is mischievous. If final decisions were not transferred from this House—from the Palace of Westminster to the palace of Whitehall—I would not have the same case. The Minister says that Members of Parliament will be able to protect the interests of their constituents, but I fear that they will not. They will not be able to move instructions, speak on the Bill, or even give evidence before a commission. A public inquiry is not quite the same. All an hon. Member can do is to button-hole a Minister in the Lobby and try to influence him. Such methods may be legitimate up to a point, but should not be encouraged or extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that not as a party politician but as a parliamentarian and a citizen of this land who knows what it is like at the bottom of the heap. Indeed, I was at the bottom of the heap for almost 20 years before I became a Member of Parliament. This will mean a bigger heap for more people. That, of course, is the party point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am wrong and that many of the complications that I envisage will not happen. I often hope that what I say will be proved wrong. I forgive the Minister for not answering my question when I asked what consideration had been given to these possibilities. I doaubt whether consideration has been given to them. I shall have to write to the Clerk or the Chairman to find out. I would not expect the Minister to know. I thank him for his exposition, but I was not suggesting that there would be a complete closure. I grant that, but all sorts of things could happen in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this has been a useful exchange of opinion. As I said, I hope that I am wrong, but I also hope that it has been useful to put these considerations on the record. I shall be content with that and not press for a Division now, although I may return to the matter later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intending to keep quiet, but my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) paints far too rosy a picture of the old procedure, which was a shambles. I am not suggesting that the new procedure will be better. However, it is important
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0807">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
to recognise that the great safeguards for the citizen which my hon. Friend suggests existed in the old procedure, did not, in fact, exist. For example, my hon. Friend knows that for a long time I have felt that the procedure should be repealed or reformed. In trying to achieve that, I, and other colleagues, blocked all the private Bills. It is amazing what happens when that is done. Local groups make contact to say, "Please can you unblock our Bill because it does this, this, that and the other." But often people asked, "Is this Bill about our area? We know nothing about it". Therefore, under the old procedure many people did not know what was going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to Standing Orders for private Bills and, no doubt, he has read them thoroughly. However, I long to find someone who can explain the private Bill procedure in a couple of pages. Many people, and colleagues, ask me to explain the procedure for private Bills. It would be nice to point to a good, concise description that people outside could read and understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct—there were enormous cock-ups. But I have asked the simple question, was an examination made of how many of these problems can be avoided, or prevented, instead of simply applying our usual practice of using the least inconvenient method—it will always be inconvenient to a point—and not going straight to other solutions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone wants to look at a clear, concise guide of the procedures of the House of Commons on public business, that is equally difficult to find. Because that cannot be done, the system should not be thrown out before efforts are made to reform it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will hon. Members relate their remarks to schedule 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I am saying to my hon. Friend is that the procedure did not work well. It is all very well to say that Parliament and Members should have a say, but I discovered that several of the Bills that I blocked were controversial. In response to inquires from other hon. Members' constituents I asked what their Members of Parliament were doing about the measures, only to receive the cynical answer that they were keeping their heads down because one constituency group was in favour of the legislation and one group against it. I understand that temptation. But is it right for a Member of Parliament to do that when changes are taking place in his constituency? An hon. Member from another part of the country should not have to involve himself in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hardest part of the procedure is the least satisfactory. If hon. Members want to bring matters to the Floor of the House there are ways to do that. Even at this stage, we could improve the Bill to retain parliamentary scrutiny, but it would be a mistake not to go along with the general provisions of the Bill, and with schedule 3. On Report, we can ask for more safeguards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the lines were counted from that, the amendments would fit precisely. There is a danger that hon.

I am advised also that the amendments as printed on the order paper relate correctly to the numbering of the lines on the corrigendum slip. Therefore, as the hon.

This is the first time that a comprehensive definition of "railway" and "tramway" will have been attempted in an Act of Parliament, so perhaps it is not surprising that the interface between the two has not been easy to devise. We hope that, as a result of the proposed amendment, this will now be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make a small adjustment to the definition of "tramway". As it stands, the definition would exclude undoubted types of tramway such as the Great Orme tramway at Llandudno, which is a statutory
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
tramway, and heritage tramway lines, such as those operated by the National Tramway museum at Crich, which is an excellent museum. Hon. Members who have children or grandchildren should take them to visit it: they would have an interesting and worth while day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is the convention after friendly and helpful Committees such as this for the Minister to take most of the Committee and officials out for a drink.

They will have to pay their entrance fees, because we all want the tramway museum to be successful. I should declare an interest—the tramway is in the constituency of Derbyshire, West, which I have the honour to represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the exclusion is that the definition refers to the rails being laid
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or mainly along a street".</p></blockquote>
The definition of "street" in the Bill, although wide, does not extend to private land. Most or all sections of the lines in question are laid on private land. Not being included in the definition would mean that the lines would be classed as railways, which obviously would be inappropriate. I hope that the Committee accepts that explanation and agrees to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's problem is that he, like us, does not know when the general election will be. If the Bill receives Royal Assent before the election, does he expect any private Bills that could be dealt with by this procedure to be introduced in the next Session, or will the regulations be in place by next autumn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is an ideal example of how statutory instruments that are not subject to further parliamentary procedure may be used to bring sections of an Act into operation. That is a necessary administrative procedure, which is unlikely to be controversial. It is a use of a statutory instrument that does not need the sort of scrutiny that we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 63 states that the sections and schedules of
	<br><blockquote><p>"this Act shall come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may appoint by order made by statutory instrument; and different days may be appointed for different purposes."</p></blockquote>
However, there is a world of difference between the part of the Bill that we are discussing and clauses 1 and 3, which use the same procedure and contain enormous powers that are untenable and have not been satisfactorily amended. Not every statutory instrument should be brought before Parliament—there are fairly narrow and clearly defined circumstances in which they should. A clause such as this is usually incorporated in Bills without any opposition from me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The irony of the clause is that it is the statutory instruments that are not made that need to be discussed. It is ironic that Committees should spend

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
much time debating a clause that is incorporated in the Bill, but may never be brought into operation by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but sometimes bits of Acts are not brought into operation for years. Large parts of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, including a survey of the needs of disabled people, were not brought into force for many years because Ministers chose not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, clause 63 demonstrates the useful administrative function of statutory instruments that are not subject to any further parliamentary procedure. That in no way mitigates the importance of the points that we made earlier. When powers are involved, there should be some sort of parliamentary procedure governing statutory instruments and their use that are not subject to any further parliamentary procedure. Such powers should be narrowly confined to clauses such as clause 63.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief question. Has the Government any policy in mind on whether the Bill, if it becomes an Act, will affect Bills currently before Parliament? It is normal for there to be a carry-over motion so that there can be a final run-through of the Bills in the next Parliament. Is that what is envisaged, or will it be possible to lay the Bills as draft orders? It is a point of some substance. I declare an interest because the borough of Newham is involved in the cross-rail Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To a large extent, that depends on one of the underlying points that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish has just pointed out—the progress that the Bill makes before the dissolution of Parliament. We hope that the Bill is enacted before dissolution, but the new orders under part I cannot be introduced until the necessary secondary legislation is ready. Hon. Members will know that we have made some progress with the rules that will govern applications, but obviously we wish to consult on them and we wish to hear what interested parties have to say. We shall have to give guidance and prepare model clauses and inquiry rules under section 11 of the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971. We shall probably start with railways and tramways because their need is most pressing, followed by inland waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall be in a position to begin the process at the end of this year, but we must get it right. That means consulting properly with all the people with whom we have been urged to consult. The new provision for the annulment procedure will also slightly delay implementation. We need to consider carefully those private Bills that are in the pipeline. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, and I—and I am sure any other person responsible for this—would be aware of the date in November by which it might be useful to have the systems up and running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the Bill will be implemented as soon as possible. On the drink and drug provisions, the main tasks are police training and discussions about the matters raised by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East on clause 30 stand part. The safety measures in chapter II depend on the preparation of secondary legislation, on which discussions with the Health and Safety Executive are already underway. The footpath measures require the preparation of secondary legislation and guidance by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
Department of the Environment. That is largely a matter of revising what exists under sections 118 and 119 of the Highways Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III will mostly take effect straight away, but harbours provisions will require guidance to harbour authorities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> New clause 7 applies certain provisions of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 to tramways. Those provisions presently apply only to buses. The new clause enables us to repeal section 48 of the Tramways Act 1870. Section 24 of the 1981 Act empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations to deal with the conduct of drivers, inspectors and conductors. The currernt regulations made under this section cover such matters as the use of microphones, passenger safety at stops, identification and smoking.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The new clause includes a new subsection (1B) which states:

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
That power is important. The local Acts involved make provision for the conduct of drivers and conductors of tramways. What sort of Acts are involved and is the provision included because of the recent regeneration of tramways in Manchester—where the supertram has been established—and in Leeds, where a tramway system has been proposed? The provision is welcome, but will the Minister elaborate on the application of new subsection (1B)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would involve mainly local Acts and sometimes very old local Acts. Subsection (6) of the new clause would add a new provision to ensure that any national regulations made under the Act would, in appropriarte cases, take precedence over local Acts with the same subject matter. With the resurgence of tramcars in cities such as Manchester—I do not know the details of the proposed system in Leeds, to which the hon. Member for Bradford, South referred—the 1981 Act should, where appropriate, apply equally to trams and buses.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 8 clarifies responsibility for prosecuting safety offences under part II. It provides that no prosecution can be instituted in England and Wales except by or with the consent of the Secretary of State or the Director of Public Prosecutions, thus eliminating the possibility of private prosecutions. The amendment brings the Bill into line with the position on prosecutions under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act, 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will authorise the Health and Safety Executive's railway inspectors to prosecute railway operators for offences relating to operational safety. For example, the steps required of an operator to demonstrate due diligence to prevent drink and drug offences is a matter which the Health and Safety Executive is best placed to consider. Likewise, it is appropriate that its inspectors should institute proceedings for offences such as failing to report an accident or contravening a direction limiting speeds or loads on a railway line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown prosecution service will be responsible for prosecuting drink and drug offences by individuals, as only the police have the testing powers to obtain the necessary evidence. It will also prosecute in road traffic cases such as failing to comply with a sign at a private level crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As at present, there will be close liaison between the Health and Safety Executive and the Crown prosecution service on prosecutions to avoid duplication of effort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause will enable the existing tramways at Blackpool and Llandudno to be leased to another body. At present, a tramway or its statutory rights cannot be transferred, although agreements for the operation of the tramway can be made. The Blackpool and Aberconwy tramways are both owned by the local authority. The Blackpool tramway is operated by a council-owned public transport company, and the Great Orme tramway is operated by Aberconwy borough council itself. As things stand at present, although both councils would like to do so, neither can lease its tramway to another party, so there is no chance of the private sector being more than an operating company. The clause would allow councils, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, to lease their tramways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is a little taken aback by the Minister's explanation. I was fascinated to learn that Blackpool is to lease its tramway system to another privately owned group. Blackpool borough council is controlled by the Labour party—and not before time— and I cannot believe that it is as anxious as the Minister implies to shed responsibility for running such an effective tramway system, which is also a prime tourist attraction in the north-west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we accept the Minister's explanation, we should hear from him what requests were made by local authorities to have the clause included in the Bill. If no such requests were made, I shall assume that this is another example of the Government's ideological passion for privatisation, irrespective of the views of local people and their representatives. The Minister must provide a better explanation than he has up to now or I shall urge my hon. Friends to resist the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am as surprised as my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East. Blackpool corporation has run the tramway system very successfully. The Government's passion for change should be resisted. Where institutions are providing an excellent service, they should be allowed to continue. Moreover, the Blackpool corporation persisted with the tramway when other local authorities—and there were many of them throughout the country—were withdrawing and scrapping them as out of date, inconvenient to traffic and so on. Trams were also compared unfavourably with diesel buses, which were regarded as more flexible and capable of being moved more swiftly out of the way of the growing number of motor cars and lorries on the roads.

Those of us who attend political party conferences at the queen of the west coast know that Blackpool's trams are run successfully. They mingle fairly amicably with traffic in the centre of the town. It is to the credit of the local authority that that is so. In fact, the council was under Conservative control when the decision to persist with the tramway was taken. It should be given credit for that. The Government should not pressure it to hive it off to operators who would be unlikely to be as successful at running the trams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, we would like trams in Southport, too. We used to have them in Lord street, but they are not there now. I suspect that the Minister will tell us that there have been offers for the leasing of Blackpool trams. On my last visit, I made one or two inquiries and found out that there have been difficulties in renewing rolling stock. That may be behind the proposed new leasing arrangements. Irrespective of whether the council is Labour, Conservative or even hung, it seems that leasing could be arranged. I would be sorry to see that happen. I would prefer to see the trams continue as they are under local authority control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members should not see the sword of Damocles hanging over the council, as suggested by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East. I am informed that the council desires the new powers—and, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is Labour-controlled. We all know Blackpool, if only because we visit it every other year as politicians, and perhaps every year by choice. The buses are alrady operated by a company, and the trams will be treated similarly. The council holds all of the company's shares. I hope that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East Accepts my assurance that the council is happy with that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the problem that my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East mentioned is not tangible, will statutory duties be dodged? New clause 9(1) suggests that there will be negotiations between an authority and the lessee about which statutory duties will apply in a new contract. Will the tramways have a duty to continue to provide a service that will run at a particular time? Many tramways originally had the duties of providing an early service and of making a set number of runs each year. By leasing the service, could Llandudno or Blackpool, for example, reduce the frequency of the services or vary the charges? New clause 9(1) suggests that the lessor and lessee will be able to decide which statutory duties should be included in a new contract. I hope that the Minister will explain that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that such a suggestion is not part of the purpose of what I thought was a relatively straightforward new clause, but which has, however, raised several problems. As the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish said, statutory responsibilities rest with the council. Under the new clause those responsibilities will, I think, be transferred to the company. However, they will remain statutory responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause says that a tramway can, in effect, be transferred to another person
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Secretary of State … for a period agreed between the lessor and the lessee … and such related statutory rights as may be so agreed."</p></blockquote>
I stress the last five words, which do not suggest that all statutory rights will be transferred automatically. The Minister must explain that phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman immediately, and while I can still remember the point that I want to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory responsibilities that will be transferred to a company will become the statutory responsibilities of that company. If some are not transferred, but are retained by a council, they will remain with that council. There should be no diminution of the statutory responsibilities that apply to either the council or the bus company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may call me a traditionalist and an old stick-in-the-mud, but I believe that the respective authorities have done a good job in running the tramway services. I remember—and we are, I am afraid, back to reminiscences again—when I was about eight, and my parents took me to Llandudno for a holiday. The driver of the tram allowed me to stand on the platform with him when we came down the Great Orme. That was a most memorable experience; I still recollect it 40-odd years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with Conservative Members, I am a regular visitor to Blackpool, although I am a little less willing to go there now than when I was a child. Blackpool's trams command widespread affection throughout the United Kingdom for their use as part of the town's transportation system and as a tourist attraction. Things that work properly should be left alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why the newfangled ideology, to which the present Administration appear to be so slavishly devoted, should interfere with the running of transport systems that have worked well and effectively. Nothing that I have heard from the Minister so far, or from those who so desperately advise him, will convince me otherwise. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friends will vote against the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would change the existing legislation on crossings by railway lines of highways other than public carriage roads—which, in practice, means crossings of footpaths and bridleways, of which there are some 2,000 in England and Wales. The proposal would introduce a new clause 48A to the Bill to amend the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 and the Transport Act 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first subsection of the new clause would add to section 61 of the 1845 Act, which requires a railway operator—in most cases, British Rail—to make and maintain convenient stiles or gates in its fence and convenient ascents or descents up to or down any embankment or cutting. However, it does not require railway operators to provide a safe crossing of the railway line itself. In many cases, British Rail has made crossings more awkward for the public to use by taking away the sleepers which were once placed there for the public to walk or ride on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause, which would also amend sections 62 and 65 of the 1845 Act, would put railway operators under a duty ot make and maintain a safe crossing and would give the highway authority and members of the public a right to go to court to have the duty enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until comparatively recently, crossings were maintained—sometimes unofficially—by the platelaying gang responsible for a specific length of track. Since the mechanisation of those railway duties and the resulting reduction in staff, the business of walking the length of the track, which was done most days, is, I regret to say, a thing of the past—as is the award of a prize, which used to be a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
monetary prize, for the gang who kept what was called the prize length. Part of the work involved in keeping the prize length was to ensure that paths and bridleways that crossed the railway were maintained. Albeit that it was sometimes done unofficially, that was part of the general pride in the upkeep of the permanent way in which railway staff indulged and in which, until comparatively recenlty, they were encouraged to indulge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safety at such level crossings is important, hence the need for the legislation to make the railway operator's duty abundantly clear. However, those days of the length being walked—if not every day, then two or three days a week—are gone, and no one appears to be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of crossings. In certain parts of the country, it is British Rails' habit to make crossings less attractive to those who wish to use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the clause makes three changes to section 62 of the 1845 Act. That section allows a court to authorise crossings to be made on the level. The first change is to extend the authority of the court to include the making of a safe and convenient crossing; it thus follows on from the amendment to section 61 to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second change is to the right to apply to the court if the provisions of the order the court has made are not complied with. At present, the right lies with the surveyor of roads, now the Highway authority—which is the county, metropolitan district or London borough council—or two local householders. The clause changes this latter provision to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any member of the public".</p></blockquote>
It does not affect the right of the highway authority. Any member of the public has the right to go to court on other matters to do with the repair of highways—for example, under section 56 of the Highways Act 1980—so the proposed amendment has a precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third change is to increase the maximum penalty for non-compliance from £5 per day to level three on the standard scale. The monetary amount of this level is currently £400, but it is due to be raised to £1,000 in the next 12 months as a result of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The reason for suggesting a change is twofold—first, to restore the value of the fine to something approaching its previous and original value, and secondly, by doing so to indicate to magistrates courts the seriousness with which matters concerning safety should be viewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third subsection would make to section 65 of the 1845 Act, which deals with a failure to maintain a level crossing and its approaches, the same changes that the second subsection makes to section 62 of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth subsection would add to section 124 of the Transport Act 1968. That section allows the Secretary of State to require British Rail to improve safety at footpath and bridleway crossings by provision of, for example, warning lights, but it does not give him the power to require the replacement of a crossing by a bridge or tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that the Government intend to make funds available to extend the current level crossing grants but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish rightly reminded me, they have not yet costed that pledge. If the Government do not do that this morning in reply to the new clause, I hope they will do so on Report. If they do not, we shall return to that point. The Minister knows that Opposition Members abhor public sector expenditure pledges that have not been thoroughly and properly costed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East, I must say that I am aware of the trap that he has laid for me. I shall not call him a militant, but as we are back on the subject of level crossings, I shall take the opportunity to offer hon. Members who expressed concern on Tuesday reassurance about the extent to which the new procedures would be used to close footpaths and bridleways across railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of applications from British Rail. I understand that it is likely to adopt a line-by-line approach, concentrating first on high-risk sites such as InterCity routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a practical limit to the number of sites that it is possible to deal with at any one time. Bearing in mind the discussions that are needed with local authorities, and the other steps relating to the Bill's provisions that need to be borne in mind, I judge that the number of cases proposed by BR is likely to be modest. They may be limited to crossings mentioned in the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill; those 11 are roughly the number that may be proposed. We are not talking of a wholesale closure of 2,000-plus footpath crossings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish spoke on Tuesday of the many footpath crossings—such as those in Wales—that are on lines with relatively low speeds, where there is no significant risk to footpath users. I cannot imagine it being in BR's interests to close unreasonable large numbers of footpath crossings because that would provoke widespread concern and opposition, which experience has shown BR it can ill afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East also mentioned investment in railway projects. When the railway inspectorate's footpath crossing requirements are firm, BR must set a standard to which to work. When it considers schemes that would affect the safety of footpath crossings, relative to the improvement of train speeds, it will have to consider also what safety measures should be applied. The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that the costs and benefits should be included in an appraisal of the whole scheme. We shall expect evidence of that for any future schemes that the Secretary of State approves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (1) to (3) of new clause 1 would place new requirements on railway operators for the maintenance of bridleway and footpath crossings, and would extend the powers of justices in cases of default by operators. I am not convinced that these new powers would be either necessary or desirable. British Rail already has a general duty under section 3 of the Transport Act 1962 to operate services with due regard to safety. It is also subject to the wide, far-reaching requirements of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. These general provisions impose sufficient obligation on BR to maintain footpath and bridleway crossings in a suitable condition. If the condition of such a crossing warranted enforcement action, the railway inspectorate could issue improvement or prohibition notices under the 1974 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a more modern and appropriate remedy than the system of applications to justices provided for in the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845. The recent trend has been to move away from the use of magistrates courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that users of footpaths and bridleway crossings have legitimate worries about the maintenance of crossings and approaches. This matter is covered by the draft requirements for footpath and bridleway crossings
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
issued recently as a consultative document by the Health and Safety Executive's railway inspectors. Copies of the proposed requirements have been circulated to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section (5) of the document specifies requirements for crossing surfaces. Users' representatives will have ample opportunity to comment on it before the requirements are introduced. I hope that the Committee will accept that this combination of general powers and non-statutory requirements makes it unnecessary to amend the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 in the way that the new clause proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sympathetic to the intention behind subsection (4) of new clause 1.I therefore give an undertaking to consider introducing a new power for the Secretary of State to require by order the provision and maintenance of a bridge or tunnel, as a replacement for a footpath or bridleway level crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a new order-making power would have the benefit of allowing grants to be paid to BR towards a bridge or tunnel, under European Community regulations No. 1991/69, which are used at present to pay level crossing grants. Under the regulations, grant may be paid only when BR acts under statutory requirement, such as orders. The regulations govern the form of compensation that would be paid to railway operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant regime would follow the same lines as the existing level crossing grant system, with grant contributing 50 per cent. of the cost. Highways and other local authorities will need to be given the power to contribute towards those costs. Commercial benefits such as higher line speeds would be taken into account when grants were being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with level crossing grants, it is not possible to say how much would be paid in any one year for footbridges or tunnels. The total would depend on the number of orders made and the cost of the bridge or tunnel, which would vary from site to site. The total number of orders will reflect the number of recommendations of public inquiries, which are impossible to predict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An overbridge can typically range from £175,000 for a bridge with steps to £220,000 for a bridge with ramped approaches. For multiple tracks, the figures would be far higher. British Rail estimates that an underpass through a four-track embankment on the east coast mainline would cost about £400,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that annual grant expenditure on footbridges is likely to be relatively modest in the context of some 25 million annual level crossing grants to British Rail. For example, if there were 10 orders for footbridges costing an average of £200,000, the annual grant would be around £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are considering the feasibility of this new order-making power, we hope that we are also giving wider consideration to the terms of section 124 of the Transport Act 1968. I may wish to table further amendments on Report. In view of the fairly comprehensive reply that I have given, setting out the Government's approach, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the Minister's comments are welcome. However, his claim that present procedures are working satisfactorily is not true. The Minister will be aware that the East Coast Mainline (Safety) Bill includes a proposal to remove the crossing at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
South Mimms, which is on a long-distance footpath. However, the crossing has deteriorated as a result of some of the procedures to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a stage when it was possible to come up the embankment, on to the level of the track, look in both directions easily to ensure that it was clear, then cross and go down the other side. It included some arrangement— either steps or at least a graded path—to help crossing. However, as a result of improvements to the track, the ballast has been tipped—I presume, mechanically—so that people wanting to cross there have to scramble up the ballast, which is not easy, and then climb to the top and look in both directions. The space in which to stand to ensure that it is safe is relatively small. They have to cross, and then scramble down the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When British Rail was electrifying and modernising that track, would it not have been better to consider simple matters so that pedestrians could safely climb the embankment, had space at the top to check both directions and could cross and descend the other side? Had it done that, it would not have been necessary for it to argue that it should be closed on safety grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were to consider other places where British Rail has introduced new methods, he would find that the safety of crossings had not been taken into account. It is all very well for the Minister to say that there are existing powers but they have not worked well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most effective spur may be to give rights to take action back to individuals. I thought that Conservative Members had embraced this individualist philosophy in the citizens charter. It may not be possible for individuals to go to court to get a path restored, but people who had difficulty crossing should perhaps be allowed some compensation—presumably, from the Minister. He should be considering ways of assisting the individual user who will otherwise end up frustrated if nothing has happened to improve the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the condition of a path is unsatisfactory, people should complain to the railway inspectorate. As I said earlier, any major investment programmes proposed by BR for lines and tracks should consider the new criteria. If necessary, we shall make necessary amendments on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of canted track which, I understand, is where one side of the track is higher than the other. BR is surveying all the crossings on the east coast main line. A complaints procedure already exists, but if the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish feels that it is unsatisfactory, we should make it clearer how people could make representations about such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should be grateful for the Minister's comprehensive reply, during the first part of which I had a coughing fit from which you did your best to relieve me, Mr. Latham. I thought that I heard the Minister say that an investment appraisal would include work that was required by the new clause. If the east coast main line electrification scheme is rerun, would British Rail, as part of that appraisal, have to state what it would do about the upkeep and maintenance of crossings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think so. If there are major new costs, a grant would be made available to meet them. We should want to know about those costs, which would be part of the overall project.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification, although there are still some problems. The cost of necessary work could take a scheme with a marginal investment appraisal below the 8 per cent. rate of return, which the Government demand that BR achieves before it is allowed to spend its own money. That factor evidently does not play a part in the cost-benefit analyses—which few of us, in my experience, understand—that apply to the construction of motorways and trunk roads in the United Kingdom. The Minister's suggestion should not weigh against railway projects, although I fear that it may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cavalry has come to my aid, and I am happy to relieve the hon. Gentleman of his anxieties. Safety expenditure is excluded from having to make an 8 per cent. return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fine. Let us hope that it will be defined that way in practice. I thought that safety expenditure would be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An increase in expenditure on safety resulted from the report of the Hidden inquiry. However, there were reductions in the grant that is available to BR for use in other areas. I am grateful to the Minister for his comment, but the situation is not as rosy as he, or the cavalry, may believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister proposed further changes to section 124 of the 1968 Act. Replacing some of the fairly ancient statutes, including the 1845 Act, with more modern legislation is perhaps a better way to approach the matter. Before the Minister drafts the changes that he said he wanted to make on Report, he should consider some of the remarks that I made when I moved the new clause. Some of the legislation, which is roughly 150 years old, should be replaced with more relevant and up-to-date legislation. However, an important concession was made in connection with the new clause. I hope that the Minister will bear in mind the points of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Gentleman moving new clause 4?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. It relates to applications of minor significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish made a slightly longer contribution than his briefest contribution, which was "Why?".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to problems that might arise from the new clause. He spoke earlier about defining schemes of national significance. He said that, initially, some schemes might not seem to have national significance but their consequences might be nationally significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall employ the same argument, because a scheme of minor significance might have wider implications. Several points were put to us—not least by the Council on Tribunals—as a result of our consultations and we felt that it was best to keep one type of scheme in operation for all the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that there are several examples of changes to railway and underground stations. Appearance is the important factor: I have in mind the shops and immediate surroundings. In some cases, planning permission was necessary for part of the scheme and a private Bill for another part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a planning inquiry into part of a scheme is necessary, will the procedures laid down in the Bill apply to the other part of the scheme? How will the two be co-ordinated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that they would run together and that such complications will not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 10</div> <!-- clause -->
	<p>	<i>Highways maintainable at public expense</i></p>
	<p>' .—() Section 36 (highways maintainable at public expense) of the Highways Act 1980 shall be amended as follows.
	<ol>
	<li>In subsection (2)(d) the word "or", where it appears for the second time, shall be omitted, and after the words "order", where it appears for the second time, there shall be inserted the words "or a rail crossing diversion order".</li>

	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(e) a highway created in consequence of an order under section 1 or 3 of the Transport and Works Act 1992, unless that order specifies that any person other than the highway authority is to be liable for the maintenance of the highway,</li>
	<li>(f) a highway, being a footpath or bridleway, created in consequence of a harbour revison order made under section 14 of the Harbours Act 1964.".'.—	<i>[Mr. Andrew F. Bennett.]</i></li></div> <!-- ul --></ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If diversions are necessary to make safer crossings, they will often require a length of extra path. Who is responsible for paying for and maintaining that path? It
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
should be clear that British Rail—or whoever it may be—has a duty to maintain the path required by the diversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is the last of the significant amendments, I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle that we should establish in primary legislation who should be responsible for maintaining footpaths or bridleways created by rail crossing diversion orders, or as a result of a works order made under clause 1 or 3, is accepted. The new path or way should not necessarily be maintained at public expense: for example, if the diversion crosses the railway at another point by way of a bridge or underpass, maintenance of that bridge or underpass would probably be the responsibility of the operator. That calls for a more flexible approach than that offered in new clause 10 and so we are considering amendments on the following lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For rail crossing diversion orders, section 36 of the Highways Act 1980 would be amended as proposed in new clause 10, but we would also make consequential amendments to sections 119A and 120 giving the Secretary of State and the council the power to direct that part of the diverted path or way is to be maintained by the operator. That will provide a basis for determining appropriate maintenance responsibilities on each order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a new path or way is created as a result of a works order made under clauses 1 or 3, the maintenance obligations can be dealt with by a model clause made under the clause 8 provision. Where a path or way is created as a result of a harbour order, sections 14(3) and 16(6) of the Harbours Act are framed in sufficiently wide terms to enable maintenance obligations to be specified in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those assurances will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that the Minister will table an amendment on Report. Can he guarantee that under the new procedures no bit of path will slip through and nobody will be responsible for maintenance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would certainly be our desired aim. I do not say that nothing of the sort will ever happen, but that is our aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he will table amendments rather than accept new clause 10. How many amendments does he propose to make on Report? That knowledge would be useful for the usual channels to assess how much time will be needed on Report to consider properly the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a definitive answer. I anticipate that, with the commitments that I have given so far, there will be about 20 amendments. Some of our commitments have been dealt with in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I will not press new clause 10 to a vote. I hope that the amendments will ensure that no bits of path slip through the net. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. May I thank you for the way in which you have chaired the Committee? On a personal note, I am sorry that you will not see the full benefit of the legislation that you have presided over so well as you will not be standing for Parliament again.

May I also thank the members of the Committee for their valid contributions to the Bill? They have improved the Bill and I have given several commitments to amend it on Report.

I hope that the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) found the Committee interesting and that it will enable him to write volume three of his railway books. He may be able to say that he thought the Henry VIII clauses were unwise but that in certain circumstances it might be useful to have those clauses for particular railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank all the officers of the Committee and all the people, including the Clerk, who assisted you Mr. Latham. We must also remember the valuable assistance that we had from Mr. Lamond, who chaired several of our sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Latham, may I, on behalf of the Opposition, and, if I may say so, perhaps of the Liberal Democrats, too, endorse the Minister's comments about both yourself, Mr. Latham, and your co-chairman? You have both displayed great tolerance and patience, even when we have inadvertently rambled from the paths of righteousness.

I also endorse the Minister's comments about everyone involved in the Committee—the attendants, the police and the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters. I also thank my hon. Friends for their patience, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley), who is unable to be with us this morning because she is at the dentist. My hon. Friend assured me that she would prefer even to listen to me than to attend the dentist. She would have liked to have been here this morning.

It has been a pleasant experience, albeit longer than we anticipated at the start of the proceedings. I wish to thank the Minister for his diligence and for the number of concessions that he made.
