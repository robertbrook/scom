</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our previous sitting, we spent much time discussing the sittings motion and how long it might take us to get through the Committee proceedings. Someone once said to me that hon. Members who spoke to amendments in Committee understood those amendments only after the sitting was over. Therefore, if the Minister did not grasp during our previous sitting the fact that we want concessions, perhaps he has understood since then that we are serious about that. Having discussed the sittings motion all Tuesday morning and listened to good arguments for not sitting on Thursday afternoon, we then discussed for a further two hours various concessions relating to inland waterways. I am
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
grateful for the opportunity to discuss in detail some of those concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with consultation, and new clause 6 would raise the status of the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council. Is the Minister prepared to concede some of the points that we made during our Tuesday afternoon discussions? I should also like to hear his views on the shopping list outlined during our first sitting by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). It might be helpful for me to remind the Minister for our worries and our wish to rectify the fiasco that has arisen because of the lack of consultation with the inland waterways bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that consultation should take place with IWAAC, which is a statutory body, before an order is made that will affect matters coming within its brief? Since the Transport Act 1968, the role of IWAAC as a statutory body, whether under the Department of Transport or the Department of the Environment, has been respected by Government except when considering consultation on this Bill. Bearing in mind that another Bill is going through another place, that highlights the dangers that the Minister will encounter by refusing to accept the need for consultation with a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want clarification of section 110 of the 1968 Act, which establishes IWAAC as a statutory body to advise and make recommendations on the development of amenities and recreation on the waterways—controlled by the British Waterways Board—and enables it to object to an order made by a Secretary of State that affects its brief. That is relevant to new clause 6. Can the Minister assure us on that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to consider the wider issues that I hope that the Minister will cover in his statement. Under the Bill, almost anything could happen to waterways. They could be sold or closed down by statutory instrument with minimal opportunity for consultation or appeal. That causes anxiety. It has led many people who care about inland waterways to write to members of the Committee and stress that, although the Government have disregarded their views so far, they wish those views to be taken into account now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister intends to make a statement. However, I shall outline the problems that the Bill presents for users of inland waterways. I stress again the anxiety caused by lack of consultation with the statutory bodies set up by the Government to advise on inland waterways issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
IWAAC was not consulted. I hope that the Minister will consult not only IWAAC, but other organisations, especially the British Marine Industries Federation and the Association of Pleasure Craft Operators on Inland Waterways. The inland waterways organisations realised the implications of the Bill late because, until the Bill was published, there was no indication that the measure would have a widespread effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation document referred to provisions for the temporary closure of waterways and for works
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
to construct other transport systems if the powers over waterways in the Bill had been confined to that, with safeguards about the length of closure and consultation, the inland waterways bodies would not have campaigned against the Bill. I stress that the parliamentary agents for the inland waterways organisations advised them that the Bill could be used by British Waterways and other organisations to gain orders that would affect general powers over waterways. However, there may be an overlap between the Transport and Works Bill and the private Bill, being promoted by British Waterways, in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister commit himself to amending clause 3(1)(a)? Will he examine the words "the construction or use" of inland waterways? Will he return on Report with new phraseology, relevant to the operation of an inland wateway: Will he commit himself publicly to wording that makes it clear that no provision of the Bill will override the inland waterways provisions of the Transport Act 1968?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waterway users were worried about the wording of clause 3(1)(a) because they believed that the words "or use" could imply that inland waterways that were classified as commercial or cruising under the 1968 Act could be downgraded by order. The lack of safeguards throughout the Bill's references to inland waterways causes great anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Waterways Association is worried that clause 3(l)(b)(i) could lead to a permanent loss of navigation rights on inland waterways. The association stresses that rights of navigation still exist on British Waterways rivers and on some independently owned waterways. The association can live with temporary closures of waterways, on which a public right of navigation exists, for works to construct new transport systems. However, the Bill should include appropriate safeguards about consultation, appeal and length of closure. The association has campaigned in the courts to protect navigation rights. That is one of its published aims. It is unacceptable for the Bill to have a permanent effect on public rights of navigation. It is important that the Minister makes a commitment to temporary changes, but he should not propose permanent changes in the way in which things can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should also clarify his commitment to subjecting parts of the Bill to affirmative resolution by the House. Labour Members have pushed for that, and I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inland waterways users are worried about any change in the governing legislation which at present requires Parliament's consent. Private Bills are subject to the full scrutiny of Parliament and the expertise of hon. Members. The waterways are a national system and boats cruise for surprisingly long distances. An increasing number of newly retired people put a year or two aside to cruise the entire system. Any reduction in the size of the system, whether permanent or temporary, affects the whole system and cannot be regarded as purely a local matter. I hope that the Minister will agree that the Bill should be subject to the affirmative resolution of both Houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
I hope that the Minister will make some concessions on clause 3 and on the matters raised by my hon. Friends at the outset of our deliberations. There is much anxiety that, if the Bill remains unamended, a future Conservative Government would downgrade and close waterways and other transport systems and do away with the canals. I assure the Committee that no Labour Government would do that, but it is well known that British Waterways has been told to maximise profits so that money can be put back into its operations. No Labour Government would contemplate for one moment putting that sort of pressure on British Waterways. However, we fear that the present Government would have no scruples about doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Michael Neubert 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Romford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. Am I alone in thinking that the temperature in the Room is intolerably high? As we are to spend five hours in here, is it possible that it could be made rather cooler?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman says that it is too hot, I must accept his word. I had not noticed it but, looking around I see that other hon. Members agree. I shall try to get something done about it, although I am not qualified to do it myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be more pleasant to have this discussion on an inland waterways cruise, which would allow us to enjoy the fresh air and our wonderful heritage. I am sure that that climate would be far more comfortable, and I agree with what the hon. Member for Romford (Sir Michael Neubert) said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask you, Mr. Latham, whether it would be in order for me to refer briefly to schedule 1 in connection with the general question of consultation about inland waterways?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Lady has asked that question, I can tell her that sometimes the Chair has diplomatic deafness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Latham. Users are especially worried about the implied effect of schedule 1 on waterways. The Minister and officials from the Departments of the Environment and of Transport have assured us that schedule 1 will be used only in the context of works to create new transport systems. Does the Minister agree that the Bill's long title and explanatory and financial memorandum should be amended to clarify the effects on new transport system, including inland waterways?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inland waterways users are also worried about the power in schedule 1(4) to extinguish rights over land and rights of navigation over water. I hope that the Minister will deal with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered the main problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish will want to raise other matters, but I wish to repeat that consultation is important. The Bill should be clearly defined as dealing only with transport and works. It should not conspire, in an underground or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
background way, to introduce general, wider powers over transport systems. There is a lack of clarity and precise definition in the long and short titles of the Bill. For those reasons, I seek some reassurances from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be useful if I made a few comments about the consequences of Tuesday afternoon's meeting, to which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) referred. My intervention will be longer than it otherwise would be as I wish to cover all the points that were raised at that meeting. My comments may deal with many of the worries of members of the Committee and may reassure the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) that I am capable of making long speeches as well as short speeches. I hope that he is suitably grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Bob Cryer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want informative speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my speech will also be informative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley), has said, she and I had a useful meeting on Tuesday afternoon with the chairman of the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council, the chairman and representatives of the inland Waterways Association and other representatives of those with interests in inland waterways. We discussed in detail their concerns about the potential impact of this Bill on inland waterways. It might help the Committee if I described the concerns that were then expressed to me and the way in which I suggested that they could be resolved. I think that that would help because, by the end of the meeting, the inland waterways representatives had accepted that some, if not all, of their concerns could be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such an explanation will help the Committee to deal more expeditiously not only with this amendment, but with others that arise on inland waterways. Therefore, I hope that you, Mr. Latham, will understand if I range fairly widely over the amendments associated with this group, because all were dealt with in Tuesday afternoon's discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the main thrust of this part of the Bill. Essentially, it will replace the private Bill procedure for the authorisation of works with an order-making procedure underpinned, where appropriate, with public local inquiries. The advantages for those with interests in proposed works are considerable. First, those who wish to press for changes in the works, or object to them, will not have to satisfy the stringent rules for locus standi which have to be met by anyone who wishes to appear before a private Bill Committee in the House or another place. Secondly, there will not be the same requirement to employ counsel and pay fees that apply in Parliament. Those and other developments will be of considerable assistance to inland waterways interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As railways and canals, for obvious geographical reasons, are often close together, railway works may
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
impinge on a canal. If inland waterways interests need to object to a proposed work promoted by a railway or other undertaker covered by the Bill, who would otherwise have been able to proceed by private Bill, they will be able to use the same, simpler procedure as is used for highways proposals. The same would apply where some proposed new tramway in an urban area has implications for the canals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are considerable advantages for those interested in inland waterways from the new procedure. The inland waterways interests, however, have been concerned that there might be some unexpected disadvantages as well. This group of amendments deals with those fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North that the Bill is intended to enable the Government and British Waterways to sidestep existing controls are groundless. There is no hidden agenda in the Bill. It is concerned only with the limited purposes that I explained on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was also general concern about the relationship between the Bill and the private Bill currently being promoted by British Waterways in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that regulations could be used in unexpected ways. If certain provisions were in the Bill, we should not be alarmed, but if they are in regulations a future Secretary of State may use them in a way that a former Secretary of State had undertaken not to do. We should be suspicious not of the Minister's intention, but of the wording. We should make sure that he cannot go beyond the original intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. It is one of the advantages of the Committee stage of a Bill, especially a Bill of this sort where there is no great division of views on whether its overall aims are desirable. What is at issue is the way that we achieve those aims. I want to allay the hon. Gentleman's fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to describe briefly the relationship between the Bill and the private Bill that is now in the other place. The fear has been expressed that the new order-making powers in this Bill were deliberately drawn very wide so that the need for the private Bill would be avoided. That fear is completely unfounded because orders made under the Bill could not cover the ground that is covered by British Waterways current private Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Officials in the Department of the Environment have looked through the private Bill, which is in four parts. The first part is purely formal; it deals with the title and so on. The second part is concerned with the board's general powers to enter land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but I am bound by the Standing Orders of the House, which make it clear that it is not in order to comment on the proceedings of the House of Lords. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to help the Committee, but he must phrase his remarks in a way that will get round the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. Of course that is correct, but surely there is a distinction between commenting on the proceedings in the other place and the content of a Bill? After all, I could get a copy of the Bill from the Vote Office and quote from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is drawing a fair distinction. In pages 375–6 of "Erskine May", it is stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Members are restrained by the Speaker from commenting upon the proceedings of the House of Lords. When a Member raised the question of the handling by the Government of a bill which had been sent to the Lords, he was advised that the business of the House of Lords was their concern and not a matter for the Speaker."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will exercise discretion and common sense in the matter. It is my duty to warn the Minister in case his speech develops in a way that is not in line with parliamentary procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Latham. I am trying to explain what is in the Bill rather than comment on the procedure in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private Bill that is currently being discussed in the House of Lords has four parts. The second part of that Bill is concerned with the board's general powers to enter land. An order under the Transport and Works Bill could clearly give powers to enter specific land for the purposes of works specified in the order, but it could not amend the board's general powers to enter land alongside all its waterways that the private Bill seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of that Bill is concerned with the regulation and management of inland waterways, including such matters as houseboat certificates, the removal of hulks—boats that have sunk—and control of moorings. Orders under the present Bill could not give the general powers covering the whole system that BWB seeks. The fourth part covers miscellaneous and general matters. It imposes new environmental duties on the board and deals with rights to build bridges over the BWB waterways and other matters. As such general matters relate to the whole BWB system, they would not be eligible for orders under the Transport and Works Bill. Part IV contains one or two matters such as the repeal of a requirement to keep locks on the river Severn open all day and night. That could be dealt with by an order under the Bill, and in future would have to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have thus demonstrated that there is no way in which the new procedure under this Bill could be used to supersede the need for the current BWB private Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the individual concerns and the amendments that have been put down to safeguard against them. I hope to show how those concerns are unnecessary, and that safeguards already exist, or that I am prepared to consider them, in order to make assurance doubly sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first main point concerns the word "use" in clause 3(1)(a) on page 2, line 3 to which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North referred. The fear
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
was expressed that we are intending to throw the net wider under clause 3 in relation to inland waterways than under clause 1. That was because clause 1 talks of orders relating to the "construction or operation" of railways and so on, while clause 3 talks of the "construction or use". The concern expressed to me was that that would allow orders under the Bill to be used to regulate such matters as the duties of BWB to maintain specific lengths of waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was not the intention. "Use" was put in the clause in place of "operation" because it did not seem natural to talk of "operating" an inland waterway. However, inland waterways have to be operated—locks have to be worked, bridges have to be swung or lifted. I am, therefore, having the possibility examined of replacing "use" in clause 3(1)(a) with "operation". Unless there are unforeseen problems, I propose to return on Report with an amendment to that effect. It would also seem necessary to make a parallel change in the long title of the Bill, another point raised by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it would be sensible just to omit "use" as proposed in amendment No. 110. That is because there are provisions in the canal legislation, like the one to which I referred, requiring the locks on the Severn to be open day and night—section 147 of the Severn Navigation Act 1842. It may be necessary in some cases to amend or repeal such provisions. We must ensure that the order-making power is sufficiently flexible to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North expressed anxiety about the possibility that the new order-making power might be used to override the existing procedures under part VII of the Transport Act 1968 to change the duties of the British Waterways board in relation to its waterways, or to alter navigation rights on other waterways. Again, that is absolutely not the case. We accept that the safeguards written into the provisions of the 1968 Act are desirable. We have no intention that this Bill should change them. That is no more than I said earlier in more general terms, but I am happy to clarify it specifically in relation to inland waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise, however, that the inland waterways .interests would prefer to have that made clear in the Bill, and not to have to rest solely on a ministerial undertaking. This is not an easy question, as there are procedures relating to other matters such as footpaths and pipelines where we need to be clear that we are not creating a consequential problem. I am therefore happy to undertake to consider whether we can make it clear in the Bill that its procedures cannot be used to make changes of the sort that are currently regulated by sections 105 and 112 of the 1968 Act. If we can find a way of doing that, we will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern was also expressed that orders under clause 3 should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. That concern is reflected in amendment No. 38. That would not be sensible, as the aim of the Joint Committee report, and of the Bill, is to institute a non-parliamentary procedure for works. It would be contrary to the general aim to bring back a parliamentary element and I draw the Committee's attention to what I said about the use of affirmative resolution on clause 1. I hope that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
assurance that I have given to preserve the existing procedures for changing British Waterways board's maintenance duties and other navigation rights— procedures that include parliamentary supervision— will meet that concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also noted the concern that the power in clause 4 to prescribe descriptions of works for which approval can be given under clause 3 should be subject to parliamentary approval. That concern is formulated in amendment No. 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That echoes the worries that the hon. Member for Bradford, South expressed over clause 2—if the power is to be given to adjust the scope of an Act of Parliament, it should be subject to parliamentary control. That is a powerful argument. I assured the hon. Member for Bradford, South that I would consider meeting his point. I hope to be able to do so. I repeat the assurance about clause 4, it is the same argument, and it would have to receive the same response. I hope that that answers the point that the hon. Gentleman made at our second sitting about affirmative resolutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxiety was expressed that clause 5(2) would permit orders for railway works to provide for the closures of canals. That anxiety is reflected in amendment No. 41. To achieve the purposes of the Bill, it is necessary to include provision to deal with works that may affect both railways and canals or both tramways and canals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have explained, it may be necessary to divert a canal to allow a railway to be widened or re-aligned or a tramway to be built. We do not intend that such joint treatment should override the safeguards in the Transport Act 1968.1 have undertaken to try to make that clear in the Bill. As a result, if it were necessary to deal with an inland waterway along with another mode of transport, the procedures under the 1968 Act would run in parallel with the procedures under this Bill, as clause 15 contemplates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next main concern expressed was the inclusion of works to waterways in paragraph (1) of schedule 1. That also embraced the reference to rights of navigation in paragraph (4) of that schedule. I gained the impression that the concerns were further facets of the concern that the procedures of the Transport Act 1968 might be disapplied. As I have given an assurance that it is not the intention to disapply those procedures, and have undertaken to see whether that can be made clear in the Bill, I do not think that I need say more at this stage. That assurance and the undertaking seem to me to meet the points that were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the role of the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council—IWAAC to its friends. The first question was whether the council had sufficient powers to comment on proposals for orders under the Bill. We have examined that point carefully, and we have concluded that it does. I think that at our meeting on Tuesday the chairman of IWAAC acknowledged that the powers under section 110 of the Transport Act 1968 were wide enough for that purpose. The Council has, in the past, appeared at public inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
Secondly, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent asked whether the need to consult the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council should be expressed in the Bill. As I told the Committee earlier, it has been our intention that the rules under clause 6 should specify the organisations to which notice of applications for orders under the Bill should be given. On Tuesday I circulated the first draft of those rules. As the Committee will have seen, the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council is included in schedule 1 to those rules as a body to which notice of applications relating to British Waterways must be given. I would point out in passing that that is an improvement on the present position, as IWAAC does not have to be given notice of private Bills affecting British Waterways board waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was urged to treat IWAAC differently from the other bodies included in the rules as those to which notice must be given, and to put it in the Bill. I think that it would not be desirable to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main issue is not that IWAAC should be given special status over the other statutory bodies, but that the need to consult with statutory bodies should be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, and I shall deal with it shortly. I hope that what I am about to propose will gain the Committee's approval, although I do not believe that such a provision should be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, and most importantly, we think that it is essential to keep the list of those on whom notice is to be served together in one place. If that is not done, and some bodies are covered by the Transport Act 1968 and others by the rules, there is scope for confusion and error. Life will be much easier, and the procedures more certain, if there is a single list. Secondly, it is essential that there is flexibility with the list of those to whom notice is to be given. Organisations inevitably change, and we need the power to keep the list up to date. Given the need to have a single list, it must be in subordinate legislation so that it can be updated. Thirdly, there are many bodies on the list. It would be invidious to have to say that some should be included in the Bill and others in the rules. I therefore argue strongly that our proposal is right. We have said that those promoting orders affecting BWB waterways will have to give notice to IWAAC. I have now produced the draft rules to give effect to that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand that the Minister does not want to put in the Bill the list of people to be consulted, but amendment No. 29 provides for a list of those consulted to be provided when the order is laid. That means that the Scrutiny Committee can see whether consultation took place. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South will confirm that when legislation requires consultation we sometimes discover that it has not. We do not blame anyone. It is easy for someone who is trying quickly to issue a new set of regulations or a new instrument not to consult. A system whereby the order was accompanied by a requirement to list the people who have been consulted would have many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
advantages. I ask the Minister sympathetically to consider amendment No. 29, which is a way of safeguarding genuine consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to give further consideration to the point made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. I thought that we had gone a long way by including in the Bill that consultations must take place. If I understand it correctly, the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the order should show that consultations have taken place. As the order stands, that should happen anyway. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a definite commitment, but I shall consider his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Faversham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the points made by my hon. Friend, but will he explain why it is possible to include the Transport Users Consultative Committee in the Bill, but not the IWAAC whose statutory position is different from other bodies that are consulted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have quickly refreshed my memory on that point. As I understand it, the TUCC does not have a statutory right to object, whereas IWAAC does. I can see that I have not convinced the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is more important that the Minister convinces his hon. Friends.—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to try to convince every member of the Committee. I have learnt that no member of the Committee can be taken for granted. The Whip says that I can take him for granted, although I am not sure about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured that my answer about the TUCC was correct. There seemed to be some inconsistency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter is extremely important, so it is important to get it right. This is not a question of confrontation; we simply want to ensure that proper consultation takes place in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend says the TUCC does not have the statutory right to object, but the explanatory memorandum provides that it is empowered
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make representations to the Secretary of State where a rail service would be discontinued if an order were made."</p></blockquote>
That statutory right to object could not be clearer—it is embodied in the Bill. I am no lawyer, but the IWAAC should be given the same status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend quoted the explanatory memorandum. The TUCC is provided for in the Bill, because it does not have that power at present, whereas the IWAAC does. The point made by my hon. Friend is covered by clause 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister understand that although the power may exist, the Government's failure to consult on the Bill highlights our reason for demanding that that provision is written in to the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Lady's point. I have undertaken to examine more closely the point made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. However, I consider the Bill to be an improvement on the present position. The British Waterways Board does not have to consult IWAAC when it lodges a private Bill. Under the Bill, consultation will have to take place; the need to consult is written into the Bill. The Bill also improves the locus standi position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite like that. An outside body only has to examine the list of private Bills to be presented during a Session. The Bill provides for a series of orders. It is a more formidable task for outside bodies to keep checking orders. The consultation mechanism must be triggered by the Government, who lay the orders. That is preferable to expecting outside organisations to check the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for consultation, which is an improvement, as long as it happens. It should include a mechanism to ensure that unless consultation occurs, the orders are invalid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now follow the gist of the hon. Gentleman's point. I wish to consider it more carefully. Perhaps the matter could be resolved by placing a duty to consult on the promoters of the order. If they do not consult properly, perhaps the Bill could provide for the order not to proceed, or allow an objection to it to be made. A private Bill is one focus point at a particular time of year. One of the Bill's attractions is to get away from deadlines such as 27 November. I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point carefully and consider whether we can improve the Bill, which is already an improvement on the present position. The hon. Gentleman made an important point and I shall consider how that aim can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to include inland waterways in the Bill if the purposes of the Joint Committee's report, which were approved by both Houses, are to be achieved. The provisions in the Bill should not override the existing procedures for the adjusting duties and rights affecting inland waterways. We shall consider whether we can include that in the Bill by tabling amendments on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall consider making orders under clauses 2 and 4 subject to affirmative parliamentary procedure. The Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council must be given notice of proposals affecting BWB waterways, and have taken steps to effect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tuesday's meeting was useful. I hope that I have given a helpful response to all the anxieties raised with me about inland waterways in Committee and at the meeting on Tuesday. I hope that we can now make progress. Inland waterways welcome some of the provisions in the Bill. I hope that I have explained any misunderstandings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not present at the meeting that you held. Could you tell me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is forgetting himself. He should address the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not present at Tuesday's meeting. The leisure and tourist industry is worried about waterways, and its rights. Earlier, the Minister mentioned moorings, fees and locks. The leisure and tourist industry was most anxious about that and I wonder whether those points were raised at the meeting. It took one line of the Minister's statement and I would like him to clarify it. The National Association of Boat Owners and many other owners of small boats who use the canals are worried about what is happening on the waterways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I mentioned locks, I was drawing a parallel with a Bill that is being discussed and saying which parts it might be possible to include in future order-making procedure. I referred especially to an 1842 Act of Parliament which states that locks must be operated 24 hours a day. That is essentially a local matter; it should not require Parliament to take a decision which could properly be done by the order-making procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the importance of the leisure industry to the inland waterways, of which I am wholly aware. Not only is the industry important, but it gives joy to many hundreds of thousands of people. It is not our intention that the Bill should change the way in which people enjoy the inland waterways. We intend to enable orders for works to be carried out without needing a private Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the meeting was set up at short notice after Tuesday morning's sitting to try to allay the anxieties expressed by several representative bodies. I hope that my remarks this morning have helped in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning's sitting shows that the Committee is in transformed circumstances, but those circumstances should not have existed. The important meeting that, as the Minister said, took place at short notice at the end of Tuesday morning's sitting may have occurred long before then. I shall make my remarks as concise and in as short a time as possible but the proper procedure of the Committee should not be sacrificed. Our debate is, quite rightly glorying in the proper use of Parliament. The Minister admitted that consultation has been of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make my remarks in two halves. First, Mr. Latham, I shall say what I would have said had I caught your eye before the Minister's useful statement and secondly, I shall ask him questions consequential upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part relates to what has and has not happened, to set the record straight. The Joint Committee report, HC 625, session 1987–88, was on proposals for works. It made little mention of proposals for cuts, to which I shall return frequently. It mentioned railways and planning considerations and highways and harbour orders, but its recommendations did not mention waterways, except in so far as they are connected with harbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That report was made in 1988. In 1990, the Government made an official response to the Select
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
Committee report, as they are bound to do. That was issued as a command paper, which I have read. It mentions harbours and railways but it says nothing about waterways. That command paper was the official, considered and extensive Government response. I see that the Minister is consulting it, but I do not think that he can challenge what I say, although he may wish to when he responds. Anyone interested in the changes would have looked at that document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Hansard</i> report for 9 December contains a written answer from the Minister for the Environment and Countryside to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs Taylor). Question and answer were as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment whether a representative of the Government attends meetings of the Inland Waterways Amenities Advisory Council; when the last meeting between the Inland Waterways Amenities Advisory Council and a representative of the Government took place; and if he will make a statement.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An official from the Department commonly attends meetings of the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council. The chairman and the vice-chairman designate of the council met my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) on 17 October 1991, and officials on 27 November 1991."—[	<i>Official Report.</i> 9 December 1991; Vol. 200, 	<i>c. 311.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of IWACC has told me—and he would confirm it in writing if he were asked—that at that 17 October 1991 meeting with the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), the possibility of adding waterways to the Bill was not considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee that it is quite extraordinary that the statutory advisory body to the Government should not be informed, either in the official Command Paper or at a meeting as recent as 17 October, that this proposal would be included in the Bill. It might even come within the remit of the ombudsperson, as the Bill was published on 11 November—less than a month after the meeting on 17 October. Moreover, the written answer makes it clear that officials met IWAAC representatives on 27 November 1991. Therefore, I take it—unless the Minister can say anything to the contrary—that there was no meeting with any Minister subsequent to the revelation that the waterways provision was to be included in the Bill from the time that the Bill was published until Tuesday afternoon. I reminded the Minister in my remarks on Tuesday that there always have been difficulties when inland waterways amenity interests are affected unexpectedly by Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to a press release from my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Transport on 21 June 1990, which covers the revelations about the Command Paper, and I draw his attention to paragraphs 49, 50 and 51, which deal with that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue that point now, but I shall look at the press release and perhaps return to the matter at a more appropriate moment. However, the Minister, in his useful intervention, did not deny the main outline of my argument, and dealing with such issues in a press release sounds more like the practice of the European Commission than Her Majesty's Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
The Minister implied that there was no threat to existing procedures. In may private role as secretary of the Inland Waterways Association I recall seeing on a Saturday list an obscure statutory instrument relating to stopping navigation on the Grand Union canal at the point where it went under Western avenue. The statutory instrument was fair and dealt with bridge design and how long navigation would be held up. It was being exercised under the existing statute, according to which the British Waterways board and the Government must act. I suspect that that statute was the Transport Act 1968, but other legislation may also apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the provisions in the Bill supersede those in earlier legislation or will they work with them? My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said that a requirement of good law-making was to have everything in one list. That would be complex enough under this Bill, but if there were four or five Acts under the Department of Transport, the Department of the Environment and—bearing in mind environmental assessments—others could require documents to be laid, difficulties would result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill covers several powers. Although they may be legalised, they do not of themselves create law, but they have a bearing on the making of orders. In the 18th or 19th century—perhaps in this very Room—in a Committee considering a Bill relating to a private canal, concessions and rights were given to persons whose land was purchased compulsorily by canal companies. Acts that go back many years contain many similar provisions. Clause 5(3)(a) states that an order under clauses 1 or 3 may
	<br><blockquote><p>"apply, modify or exclude any provision of an Act of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
Could that apply to the safeguards, or the provisions, in the 19th Century Acts? If the procedure of the House is changed, provision must be made to change those original Acts by statutory instrument. If we are no longer to have private Bills, we cannot use them to amend earlier legislation. We may return to that important power later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention future clauses only in passing, Mr. Latham. I have already drawn attention to clause 5(3)(a). Subsection (3)(b) states that the Secretary of State may make such amendments as he deems
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be necessary or expedient in consequence of any provision of the order or otherwise in connection with the order."</p></blockquote>
The words "expedient" and "connection" cover a wide scope. Subsection (4) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions that may be made by an order under section 1 or 3 above.</p></blockquote>
Section 3 deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"Orders as to inland waterways".</p></blockquote>
So it is not simply a matter of railways and their effect on waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the Minister's refusal to include in the Bill a requirement to consult IWAAC. New clause 6 consists of only six lines. It begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In section 110 of the Transport Act 1968 (which establishes the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council) after paragraph (b) of subsection (2) there shall be inserted".</p></blockquote>
I think that the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) would approve of that, but at present the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
Minister does not seem inclined to accept it. Perhaps he will think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council is a statutory body set up to safeguard the amenities of the waterways. Amenity is to do with property and there are various attitudes in the British Waterways Board and the Government about the statutory bodies of what might be called the nationalised industries. Those matters are germane to our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary and worrying especially after the problems in the past week or so, that the Minister said that the statutory body is not to appear in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of this morning's debate, it is illogical for there to be two separate groups of amendments. The selection is provisional and the Chairman might have deemed that the two groups should be taken together. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South is not too happy with that but it would mean that my speech could be briefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair considered the matter as the debate proceeded. I made a selection and although I have the power to change it as we go along, I deliberately allowed the Minister and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Mr. Walley) to range wide because that was in the best interests of the Committee. We shall stick to the selection as it is; the hon. Members will tailor their speeches on later amendments according to what has already been debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. I accept what you say, Mr. Latham. The next group of amendments is important as it relates to the inclusion of waterways in the Bill. A discussion on that subject would be useful because there is a difference between construction and use which we should consider. I hope that the Minister will agree and that we shall proceed with reasonable brevity and clarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been much talk about statutory rights of consultation, but that is only half the story. More important are the informal consultations and the relationships that result. In the matter of IWAAC and the inclusion of waterways in the Bill, there was a breakdown in human relationships and in the two-way discussions that should be a matter of routine between Government and statutory bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were accusations that the Government failed to consult and ther are reasonable grounds for saying that IWAAC should have spotted what was going on. It is not a one-sided matter. There is little point in dwelling on it, the important thing is to get it right. [	<i>Interruption,</i>] I am sorry to disturb the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing); I want to respond to his arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall with pleasure that the Government's consultative document included waterways, as I was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
on the Select Commitee. The better procedure would benefit waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister quoted from the consultative document—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] That point speaks for itself. There is little point in pursuing the issue too far. We should not be governed by press notices but that too referred to the inclusion of waterways. Many hon. Members received leters from the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was the date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The letter was dated 9 December 1991 and was signed by six organisations, at least a couple of which made representations about the Bill, especially about the section dealing with marinas. The general feeling was that a lot of users may have missed the point, but perhaps their attention should have been drawn to it. I do not say that there was no breakdown, nor that that fault did not originate somewhere in Government, but nobody is infallible. However, it could and should have been spotted by a statutory body such as IWAAC, whose function is to monitor such things.

There is no profit in trying to blame eveybody. The important thing is for the Committee to continue what the hon. Member for Newham, South described as our "voyage of discovery". We are discovering some of the problems and correcting them so that the ship can sail on happily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman supports the Minister in saying that the consultative document referred to the matter. However, the Minister chose not to quote the relevant paragraphs or sentences. For the sake of accuracy, will the hon. Member for Faversham tell the Committee what words that document used to convey the meaning that he implies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 49 of that document makes clear the intention to include inland waterways work in the Bill, and paragraph 41 contains a similar reference. That is a brief summary, but little will be gained from pursuing the matter. Clearly, there was a slip up, partly by a Department and partly by other bodies with statutory duties. I am sure that those bodies do not have vast resources to pursue the matter. My point is that there has been a misunderstanding which should now be cleared up. The efforts of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North and the response from my hon. Friend the Minister have recognised a genuine worry felt by waterway users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still convinced that waterways users will be better off as a result of the Bill. I think that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) serves, as I do, on the Court of Referees, which has to determine the locus standi of organisations wishing to make representations. It is often hard to refuse locus standi to people whose case we consider reasonable. The new procedure will allow local bodies greater opportunity to make representations at local planning inquiries. That will avoid the cost and difficulty of coming to Parliament. That important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
consideration is really the purport of the Joint Select Committee's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private Bill procedure sometimes can be a tremendous form of defence, but very often it is a form of Russian roulette, when those who object most on minor points get lost among other political considerations. The proposed system is fairer and better, and the planning procedures are a great improvement on the unfair and costly private Bill mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I understand the anxiety of the users of waterways. There are not many amenity users of roads or railways in the same sense—we do not see many caravans moored at the roadside, nor are there hulks abandoned on railway lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I accept that informal consultations are frequently necessary in Committee. However, could hon. Members please sit down when they hold such consultations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wished to clarify whether the hon. Gentleman included ramblers and people who enjoy walking along footpaths in his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is not absolute. Of course ramblers use footpaths and amenities. However, semi-settled amenity users, such as people who live on houseboats, use waterways. Those people spend much time on the waterways. They are different from ramblers. There is a great distinction between the operation of motorways, roads, railways, even footpaths and waterways. "Use" has a different meaning for those who spend a large part of lives enjoying the water. I press my hon. Friend the Minister to include in the Bill the right for their representatives to be consulted on matters that are relevant to waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister suggested that waterway users would have more power under the Bill than under private Bill procedure. So be it, but it is not enough. They have little statutory power, if any, and the Bill grants them only a little more. My hon. Friend the Minister should accept in principle that IWAAC should have a statutory right to be consulted. The right wording can be decided later. I am not completely satisfied with the answer that my hon. Friend the Minister gave. I hope that he will consider the matter further. A statement of intent should be made. If the right to consultation is included in the Bill and is generally accepted, I shall be satisfied. But I am not impressed by what I have heard. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give a clearer assurance that the intention to grant IWAAC rights of consultation will be made in statutory form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's words have been helpful. However, I wonder whether he could go further: I do not expect him to grant more concessions, but can he tell us when he will deliver the concessions that he has half promised? Outside

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
organisations have lobbied hard. I notice from the record of our previous sitting that the Committee took a long time to discuss the sittings motion. After that, a fruitful discussion took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister promised this morning to consider many issues. He could keep very quiet and, just before Report, claim that he had examined all the points carefully but, for various reasons, could do nothing about them. That would make it difficult for outside bodies to mount a lobbying effort, especially on detailed points, to a substantial number of hon. Members. If the Minister cannot give the Committee an undertaking that, by the second or third week in January, he will have decided whether his promises can become firm amendments, can he offer outside organisations the opportunity of a meeting at the end of January? He could then tell them how far he had been able to meet their requests. We could then estimate the likely progress of the Bill and when it would return to the Floor of the House. Outside groups would know whether the Minister could fulfil his promises well before Report. They could then progress to the lobbying stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this spirit of Christmas joy and understanding, I shall go a step further than the hon. Gentleman requests. I shall undertake not only to hold such a meeting towards the end of January or in early February, but to write to the Committee. I shall draw upon the issues that have been raised this morning and inform the Committee how we intend to deal with the points that I made during a long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful because it means that we should make rapid progress this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will clause 3 relate to clause 9, which deals with schemes of national significance? That is particularly relevant to possible canal closures. Can the Minister assure us that no canals will be closed as a result of the Bill? I understand that it may be necessary to close stretches of canal as a result of one of these orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example from Greater Manchester. Much of a section of the Ashton canal, known as the Hollingwood branch, is overgrown with reeds. It is no longer navigable, although water seeps through the reeds and feeds into Ashton canal, so keeping it navigable. If it were proposed to close a stretch of the Hollingwood branch, that would be a purely local matter and would be best debated locally. It would have no national significance. However, if it were proposed to close a short stretch of the Ashton canal it could also be argued that that was of only local significance and affected only those people in my constituency who live nearby. However, because it links into the Manchester ring, the closure could be classified as being of national significance, as it would mean breaking the ring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would such a matter be dealt with? I can think of no circumstances in which it would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
legitimate to break that ring. From time to time, pressure has been brought to build across the canal and such a proposal might be made again. How can be guarantee that such a matter is treated as being of national significance under clause 9, with a proper debate in Parliament? Would it be up to the Minister to make that decision? Who will decide whether schemes are classified as being of local or national significance? That is one concession that I want the Minister to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already agreed to ensure that those outside know how many concessions he can deliver. Secondly, I should now like to know the extent to which provisions in the Bill will be used to close any stretch of canal. If the Bill can be used for that purpose, will there be a guarantee that a branch that is no longer navigable will be classed as being of local significance, but part of a canal that is significant to long-distance navigation will be treated on a national level and a parliamentary debate will be held on the principle of the closure? Thirdly, how will the Minister give back to Parliament the power to decide what is of local or national significance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Whalley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to respond briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I help the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Whalley) without suggesting what she may wish to do? If an hon. Member wishes to withdraw an amendment, no other hon. Member may speak after the amendment has been withdrawn. If the hon. Lady wishes to speak now, of course she may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the end of the Committee proceedings we shall all know much more about parliamentary procedure, Mr. Latham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a wide-ranging debate. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Whalley) said earlier, it is a pity that the Committee cannot meet on a barge on a canal. That reminds me of my by-election campaign when we held a press conference on a canal barge on Cromford canal. As the Leader of the Opposition was coming, we decided that the press would like something to lighten their minds and held the conference on a canal barge. I was asked numerous questions about canals and our form of transport, which was being pulled by a horse. One of the journalists, Adam Raphael, asked the person controlling the barge about the name of the horse. That is one of those open questions—it could be anything. This incident was at a time when my right hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) was prominent and some of her sayings were noticeable. It turned out tht the horse's name was Tina.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. All these people come under the category of amendment No. 109 and are
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other persons or bodies appearing to him to have a significant interest in the use of inland waterways".—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I am extremely grateful for your guidance, Mr. Latham. Your ruling had the same effect on the Committee, as the answer Tina had on the assembled press crowd that morning. It was like
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
saying, there is no alternative. That anecdote came to mind when the hon. Lady said that we should hold the Committee on a canal barge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been useful. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) asked how we would deal with matters under the clause that concerns national significance. I shall consider his remarks in the Christmas spirit. It will no longer be Christmas when we discuss that clause, but the new year will bring the season of goodwill to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the provisions of the Bill could be used to close a canal. The answer is that parts of the Bill could be used in that way, but I have made it clear that the procedures set out in the Transport Act 1968 will have to be followed. The Bill does not attempt to supersede or change the requirements of that Act. I hope that that answer reassures the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with points made about the Report stage of the Bill. I shall try to inform interested parties about any amendments on inland waterways that will be tabled on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) asked about consultation. If we were aware that a body had failed to consult IWAAC or any other body that it is required to consult under the rules, we would not issue a certificate for an order to allow it to continue. It is clear that the bodies wanting to facilitate an order will be required to consult. If they fail to do so, they will not be allowed to continue with the order-making process. That answers the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and the point that worried other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) asked me to quote certain paragraphs, but he now has the report. I am inclined to say what my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham said. We are now dealing with the Bill and should ensure that what it contains is acceptable and right for all bodies concerned. There is no cause for a great party-political divide, but we are keen to get the Bill right for when it goes on to the statute book. I hope that I have responded satisfactorily to the arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made some progress in our voyage of discovery this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned a by-election press conference in his constituency. We contemplated holding many press events in constituencies all over the country on these issues if we had not made progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall summarise the issues that we discussed. Comments were made about the lack of consultation, especially by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. Neither IWAAC nor the Inland Waterways Association had seen the consultative documents or the press release. Whether that is attributed to a conspiracy theory or to something else, it explains why there was so much anxiety about the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that we can go ahead now but we must find out exactly what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
is happening. Is my hon. Friend saying that IWAAC was not officially sent a copy of Cm 1110 and, therefore, irrespective of the contentious paragraph, did not know that the document existed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my interpretation of events is wrong I shall be corrected later. I understand their neither IWAAC nor the IWA had seen the consultative document or the press release. That is why we believed in the conspiracy theory: that all kinds of general powers for works were being introduced through the back door, given the state of play of the Bill being considered in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was aware of the comments of the IWA and IWAAC when, at a late stage, the Minister and his Department woke up to the fact that there had been no consultation, they did their best to produce a statement that would redress that failure to consult. The IWAAC was angered by the Department's cavalier attitude to waterways users by its failure to explain why IWAAC was not fully and properly consulted during the drafting of the Bill. Apologies are not enough. That is why we have used the Committee stage of the Bill to seek the Minister's assurances. More work needs to be done to spell out the details of the affirmative resolutions that we want. Concessions were given to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) and they should be confirmed. The Minister assured us that the Bill would not change the fact that the Transport Act 1968 supersedes everything else. His remarks made me slightly anxious because he referred only to sections 105 and 112 of that Act. Do his comments relate to the Transport Act 1968 in its entirety or just to certain sections of it? I hope that those issues will be discussed in further consultations with the groups involved and that the Minister will brief the Opposition on the alterations in the Bill before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 2, leave our lines 3 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several matters in clause 3 still need to be straightened out. Page 8 of Cm 1110 sets out—and emphasises with two big black dots—the Government's broad approach to proposals for
	<br><blockquote><p>"railway and light rail/rapid transit projects".</p></blockquote>
It also states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"more harbour measures should be considered and approved outside Parliament."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
Paragraph 49, to which the Minister referred but from which he did not quote, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In most years there are also a small number of other works bills promoted. Some of these are introduced where the proposed works would interfere with navigation; current examples are the River Tees Barrage and Crossing, Cardiff Bay Barrage, and Medway Tunnel Bills. Others include Water Authority (Company) Bills for flood relief and tidal defence schemes and British Waterways Bills for canal works."</p></blockquote>
That relates to the question of navigation, which it treats in a very subordinate way. No reasonable reader of the consultation paper would assume that it referred to the construction of inland waterways, as mentioned in clause 3. Such construction is very different from temporary interference with navigation. The purpose of amendment No. 37 is to find out why clause 3 refers both to "use" and to "construction".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the purpose is to remove more Bills from the workload of the House. That, after all, was the purport of the Joint Select Committee. But he will know, even if there is a new era of canal building, that there is unlikely to be a plethora of Bills dealing with construction of light or major railways. The only recent Bill for major construction that I can think of covered navigation for light rail transit in south Yorkshire. Even if there were a few such Bills, they would not be a burden on parliamentary time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 49 of Cm 1110, which I read out, deals with estuarial works such as barrages. However, a waterway can be multipurpose. It can be used for flood control, tidal protection, the provision of fresh water and the discharge of dirty water and possibly for irrigation and agricultural drainage. All those elements can be found in a single project. So how should a "waterway" be defined? When does a waterway become a harbour, for instance? When does a barrage become a harbour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister has thought about that problem, and I look forward to his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we may have pursued the Command Paper enough, but I refer the hon. Member for Newham, South, who read out paragraph 49, to paragraph 50 as well, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Joint Committee recommended that in general, works projects should be considered outside Parliament. They appear to have concluded that beyond establishing the order-making procedure and extending the scope of harbour orders this could be achieved administratively by separating out the primary and secondary purposes of projects and by limiting private bill consideration and approval strictly to those (often secondary) aspects of proposals for which private bill approval is required."</p></blockquote>
Following much parliamentary pressure, that was the Government's response, which has met with the approval of the majority of hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a completely satisfactory reply and I shall expect an answer on the subject of definitions later in our discussions.

We return to the favourite topic of schedule 1, to which clause 5 refers. Amendment No. 40 would omit the subsection that covers inclusion in schedule 1. The subsection states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the matters as to which provision may be made by an order under either of those sections include those set out in Schedule 1 to this Act."</p></blockquote>
The word "include" does not mean that it is inclusive. It means that it may include some, but not necessarily all, of the matters in schedule 1 and can also cover others as well. The word "include" qualifies the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated schedule 1 earlier and will return to it later, but I want the Minister to clarify the reference in clause 5. I believe that the word "include" is used here in a similar way to the word "illustrative", which the Minister used earlier and to which I took exception. The word "include" is inexact: either the clause must mention the applicability or non-applicability of all matters in schedule 1 or it must allow other matters that do not appear in the schedule

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
to be added. I do not understand the relationship between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 41 refers to the number of schemes that may be covered by an order. In view of the complexity of the issues and the potential size of the orders, it would be preferable to ensure that one order covered one scheme. That would simplify matters, even if schemes were taken together during inquiries or debates in the House. Amendment No. 41 would make that possible. One scheme should cover one system. Clause 5(2) provides that different systems could be covered by one order. For the sake of good orderliness, it would be better to separate systems, order by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 42, which applies to subsection (3), is very important. I asked the Minister about it earlier, but received no reply. I shall not complain, because he might not have had time to ask about it. Subsection (3)(a) states that an order may
	<br><blockquote><p>"apply, modify or exclude any provision of an Act of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
A statutory instrument that does not need to be considered under the negative procedure could, therefore, amend any Act of Parliament. The scope of amendment is unrestricted. It is an extraordinary constitutional device. It was used in the Harbours Act 1964, and its effect can be extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a special interest in the port of London— there are 20 miles of deep-water quay in the royal docks. I have also followed the affairs of the port of London as closely as possible. The constitution of the Port of London authority was set up after debates in the House in about 1910 or 1912. Lloyd George introduced the Bill, which had to be withdrawn at one stage. The Port of London authority was regarded throughout the world as a leading public corporation. It experienced difficulties later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I discovered, to my astonishment, that the constitution of the Port of London authority board had been changed. In my bookcase, I have a well-thumbed copy of the Port of London Authority Act 1968. It refers to the importance of navigation and sets out the operation of the major port of Britain. I discovered that a statutory instrument under the Harbours Act had come before the House and altered the constitution of the Port of London authority board almost beyond recognition. An inquiry had taken place in a hall in south London. I had not even heard of it, despite keeping a close eye on Port of London matters. Perhaps the onus to find out was on me. But under the procedure outlined in the Bill, enormous changes can be made, almost by sleight of hand, by officials who advise Ministers, who then take the responsibility. They travel home at night or in the early hours of the morning. They then go through their boxes. It is easy to get such an order through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example that is even better known to Conservative Members, especially one of them. It applies to King's Cross. Everyone knows the important story about St. Bartholomew's hospital and King's Cross. The Great Northern Railway Act 1880 said that if the railway no longer wanted the land north of the King's Cross terminus, it should be made available to the original owner, that is, St. Bartholomew's hospital. That caused a great furore
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
with the promoters of the private Bill on the channel tunnel. Some Conservative Members know more about that than I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the order irrespective of the size of the project, which may be of national importance, would not it be possible for a statutory instrument to amend the Great Northern Railway Act 1880 and cut out St. Bartholomew's hospital from its rightful property? I do not know whether that is so. I have given two London examples of the danger of extending the use of a power that is already in the Harbours Act 1964.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tabled amendments Nos. 24 and 26 because clause 5 is a Henry VIII clause. The Henry VIII clause has been the subject of a modest amount of debate, in particular, at the third Commonwealth conference on delegated legislation held at Westminster in 1989. One speaker pointed out that in 1929 the Donoughmore committee examined the operation of the Henry VIII clause, so called because it refers to the absolute powers of that monarch. The Donoughmore committee recommended that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be abandoned in all but the most exceptional cases, and should not be permitted by Parliament except upon special grounds stated in the Ministerial Memorandum to the Bill."</p></blockquote>
The speaker said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the event, it was not used again from 1932 certainly until 1939, and I think not until the end of the second world war. It was demonstrated in such important Acts as the Local Government Act 1933 and the Public Health Act 1936 that its use could be avoided if sufficient care was taken in drafting the legislation. That was in spite of all the departmental arguments even in the late 1930s— and they are still heard today—that although the Henry VIII clause is regrettable, it is necessary to ensure flexibility.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I gave that historical background to show that it is misleading to believe that there are good historical precedents for what is happening today. Ministers, at any rate in this country, take power to amend or repeal primary legislation by order, almost as a matter of common form ... I believe that what is happening today is—in the words of Lord Simon—'a constitutional outrage'."</p></blockquote>
Those comments were made by Lord Rippon of Hexham, not by a supporter of the Opposition. He has repeatedly raised the issue in the Lords. It may well be prudent of the Minister to take our comments into account because scrupulous people in the other place, who are concerned with the constitutional issue, may well want to examine the matter at length. No guillotines can be applied in the House of Lords. We all want the Bill to have a smooth passage, so it would be helpful if the Minister ensured that the proposal was modified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments limit the instrument-making power in clauses 1 and 3 to amend or repeal primary legislation. My amendments confine the powers to amend or repal delegated legislation. That is important. Primary legislation undergoes all stages,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
including Committee. It is a constitutional outrage that, through an instrument that is not subject to any further parliamentary procedure, a Secretary of State is given the right to amend or to repeal any Act of Parliament. Other amendments refer to specific sections of the Transport Act 1968 because people want safeguards. It would be better if the Bill excluded the repeal of primary legislation. It is wrong that Parliament should spend many hours examining legislation and then, by ministerial fiat, a Secretary of State can amend it without further parliamentary procedure. It is wrong that the Henry VIII clauses are used for administrative convenience. We should erode that convenience and bring back accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can say something constructive in reply to the amendments that we have tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with amendment No. 40 before replying to the important points raised by the hon. Gentleman. I hope that I can reassure him that I attach great importance to the matters that he has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 40 would not achieve what the hon. Member for Newham, South intends. Indeed, it would have the opposite effect. It would so widen the order-making powers under sections 1 and 3 as to make them untrammelled. That is because schedule I is, in effect, removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 41 would prevent promoters from putting forward draft orders covering miscellaneous works and other matters, as is currently possible under private Bill procedure. If we are to replicate this procedure in orders, as the Joint Committee recommended, this provision must be retained. It would also mean that where a scheme was partly a railway and partly a tramway, two orders would be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining amendments would mean that ministerial orders would not be able to do what is currently possible under both private Bills and light railway orders. Promoters need to be able to use orders to modify, apply or disapply the provisions of private Acts and public general Acts to the particular circumstances of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help if I give examples. I am wary of giving this particular example, because I know that the hon. Member for Bradford, South will not have to think very hard about it. The Railway Clauses Consolidation Acts are often applied or disapplied. There are two distinct land compensation codes and we must make clear which is to apply. In the case of trams, Parliament has just provided general provisions in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991. We have drafted in this way because we cannot hope to be comprehensive. In most cases the power will be used to place obligations on promoters. Without these powers, which would be required in most orders, promoters or the Secretary of State would have to seek the same result through a private or hybrid Bill. Most hon. Members would regard that as a retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill limits the use of those powers to matters on which orders can be made. The courts are likely
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
to construe that expression narrowly. It would be an unwary Secretary of State who leaned too far in favour of the promoter or towards excessive controls on him by the use of the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite the case of the British Railways Board (Keighley and Worth Valley) Light Railway Order 1967. The hon. Member for Bradford, South has probably written one or two books about it. That is why I am wary about referring to that order. It modified section 47 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, applied the Interpretation Act 1889 and disapplied sections 5 and 6 of the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. At an earlier sitting, the hon. Member for Bradford, South said that it was ridiculous that, in interpretaing an Act, a Minister had to say that certain provisions had to apply to a certain steam locomotive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I take seriously the matters raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, South in their wider connotations, there must be some leeway and that is what we must address. I see no real harm in that and it added to the flexibility he so rightly commended at Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Joint Committee recognised at para 51 of its report, many orders will necessarily change works previously authorised by private Act, so it must be possible to be able to do that in orders. Amendment No. 26 would make it impossible. It is not our intention to amend public Acts by this provision, but we accept that the powers as drafted in clause 5(3)(b) are too wide because it would allow the permanent amendment of law which is of general application. We are willing to reconsider this part of the clause, and shall look to make amendments later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have gone some way in accepting the concerns rightly raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, South, and that therefore the Committee will feel able to withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the reasons for including two systems in a single order, and the Minister has satisfactorily explained that. It is the condensation of the scope of a Bill into an order that raises, eyebrows, but I grant that that is a natural consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister has satisfactorily explained—to use St. Bartholomew's hospital as an example—whether any Government would be able to cancel any part of any former Act, as it states on the face of the Bill. I use the dramatic example of the Great Northern Railway Act 1880. Perhaps the Minister could explain further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister can assure us either that he can accept the amendments or that they are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the inland waterways user groups whose interests the hon. Members are representing in moving these amendments have reasonable grounds to want to see the statutory duties of the British Waterways Board maintained. For the same reasons I explained when we looked at the last group of amendments, I agree that it would be totally improper for secondary legislation to be used to go against the will of Parliament expressed in the primary legislation which imposed the now long established maintenance duties of the British Waterways Board, as set out in section 105 of the Transport Act 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) asked me whether I was being specific about certain parts of the Act, but not specific about other parts. I was referring to the whole of the Act. In my comments I was referring to the various sections I was addressing at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the notes on clauses would give some indication to members of the Committee of how the power under clause 5(3) would be exercised by the Secretary of State and the restrictions on its use which would be made plain to potential applicants. I cannot seriously imagine the circumstances where a Secretary of State would try to use this power to amend the duties set out in section 105, nor could I envisage that he, or the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, or the courts would accept that an order under this Bill would be the proper vehicle to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I appreciate the reasons for these amendments, they do not, I suggest, represent an appropriate way of tackling the problem. The purpose of this clause, and most of the others dealing with the new order-making procedure, is to establish the general principles of the procedure. Narrowly defined changes to the provisions of the Bill such as these fit uneasily into their setting and could have unwelcome consequences. If it were desired to name specific instances where the power under subsection (3) is to be restricted, all those instances will have to be identified. By picking out the Transport Act 1968 for special attention. By picking out the Transport Act 1968 for special attention in these amendments, it could justify the interpretation that any provision of a public general Act not named here could be amended or revoked under subsection (3)(b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I have taken note of the obviously genuine concerns that have been expressed about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
extent of the power conferred under clause 5(3), and I am reviewing whether any more general adjustment of this clause is desirable. I hope that, on the basis of this assurance, the hon. Members will withdraw their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's precise language. Putting it into plain words I believe that he is saying, "Yes, this is a genuine complaint. A Minister could make an order that is contrary to the duties of the British Waterways Board under section 105 of the Transport Act 1968. I do not believe for one minute that he would do so, but he could. If that was challenged"—this is where I disagree with the Minister's statement—"a court would throw it out." That would not be so if the Act said that a Minister had the power to do something and he did it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no canal in the Mole valley and it is unlikely that this Minister would issue an order relating to the Cromford canal for obvious reasons. However, he admitted that it was possible. Now he says that it is not appropriate to put it in because the order applies to the general Act. But that refers to the duties of the existing statutory British Waterways Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duties of a statutory body which appear at the beginning of an Act of Parliament, are the hinge on which the rest of the Act moves. The duties of the British Waterways Board as specified by will and Act of Parliament are fundamental. If the amendment does not suit for legal reasons, some other drafting must be found. If it is not, some Minister, some day could do what the Minister was told he could do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal came from the Open Spaces Society. It has not been mentioned before, but the society has made a contribution. When a highway authority wants to construct or to improve

roads across common land or open space it must either provide land in exchange which is no less in area and is equally advantageous to the public, or it must subject the compulsory purchase order to special parliamentary procedure. That is a recognition of the special importance of commons and open spaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highways Act 1980 allows the exercise of compulsory powers to acquire property not directly affected by the operational requirements in order to provide exchange land for common or open space, but operators under the private Bills procedure and, therefore, under this Bill, claim that they have no right to seek such powers. The amendment would ensure that they have the same powers as the highways authorities and can therefore provide exchange land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to amendment No. 128, schedule 1 makes no reference to the matters necessary to mitigate the effect of operators' principal requirements, for example, the provision of exchange land for common or open space, or the diversion of affected rights of way. The amendment adds those to it. I hope that the Minister will accept this simple amendment or give me assurances on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make it clear that the powers in the Bill are wide enough to encompass the acquisition of lands and rights in land that the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) presses upon us. The presence of clause 12, which applies special parliamentary procedure when exchange land has not been given, is a clear indication that it should be. I would advise against applying the Highways Act 1980 provisions, as they apply to acquisition of land to mitigate adverse effects. Under that Act, they can be used only before a road has opened or improvement has taken place. That prevents highway authorities from doing sensible things when the effects of the road are known more accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 3, line 6, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) No order under section 1 or 3 above authorising the stopping up of a highway shall be made by the Secretary of State unless he is satisfied that another reasonably convenient route is available or will be provided before the highway is stopped up.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would include in the Bill the provisions of sections 14 and 18 of the Highways Act 1980, which cover the making of orders for new and improved roads. I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit behind the amendment. It would add to the requirements for orders under the Bill the same safeguards for highway users, whether they be motorists, walkers, cyclists or horse riders, that exist under the Highways Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
It is not suggested that the stopping or shoring up of a highway or road, bridleway or footpath should be ruled out. The amendment is not so extreme. However, we want the Secretary of State to be satisfied that a convenient alternative route would be provided by order when a project under the works legislation goes ahead. If the Minister is prepared to accept that, we would have achieved a level playing field for road, rail and waterway schemes. One of our major concerns is that transport systems should be integrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley). The Minister seems to have made good progress in clearing up problems with the inland waterways lobby, but I wonder what he is doing to help the footpaths lobby. I understood that there was a promise to the hon. Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. Haslehurst), who chairs the rights of way committee, that there would be effective consultation. I think that one meeting has been held between Department officials and the Ramblers Association, but the promised consultation has not been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will fix a date in early January, preferably before the House resumes, for a meeting between his officials, the Ramblers Association and other members of the rights of way committee, so that all those matters on which the Minister might make concessions could be discussed in full. That in turn might make it possible for us to reduce the number of amendments that are tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North that this is a key issue for walkers. If a footpath has to be closed because of works, the promoters should have a duty to find a suitable alternative. I hope that the Minister accepts the amendment and is able to set the consultation process in train so that many more amendments can be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be able to tell the hon. Gentleman that our record on meetings with the Ramblers Association is 100 per cent better than he alleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the intention that lies behind this amendment but, as drafted, it would require a promoter to provide an alternative right of way in every case where a works proposal resulted in the need to stop up a highway, irrespective of whether the existing right of way was needed. I think that a more flexible approach is called for, based possibly on the provisions in section 251 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. That allows the Secretary of State some discretion in deciding whether the circumstances of the case justify the provision of an alternative right of way, taking into account the need for an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have given some assurance. It is obviously something that we will look at. I am happy to arrange another meeting possibly with the Ramblers Association, but the hon.

We are starting to get the point across that consultation is important. It should not be restricted to one group but should be more extensive and should embrace other organisations. I am delighted that the Minister has said he is prepared to look at how discretion could be given to the Secretary of State to offer alternatives when roads, footpaths or bridleways are closed as a result of works under this Bill. When he said that, I was mindful of the discretion that was given to the Secretary of State on another Bill—the recent ports legislation which gave the Secretary of Sate the discretion to look favourably at employee-management buy-outs of ports. My understanding of a decision made yesterday is that that discretion does not appear to be being used for Middlesbrough. We are talking about a principle. If discretion is to be given, we want to be sure that every possible concern and argument will be applied and that the discretion will not be left high and dry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady draws totally the wrong parallel with the trust ports.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be having trouble with this canalised river. On clause stand part, we can deal with the purpose of the schedule. The amendment is designed to clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"creation and extinguishment of rights".</p></blockquote>
That should be made clear, which is why the amendment seeks to insert the words "expressly specified". The Minister will say that rights are always expressly specified, but I doubt whether that is always so. Unless they are expressly specified and the statutory instrument is clear, problems can arise in subsequent law. The amendment would add clarity in the execution of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Member for Newham, South hopes to improve the protection under the new procedure for those who may be affected by orders which include provision, say, to stop up a right of way or to create new rights of access over their land. The amendment, however, is not necessary, as it would not be possible for an order to have any effect if it did not state clearly what effect it was supposed to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application procedure rules that are to be made under clause 6 will provide safeguards for those affected by schemes. Anyone whose land is directly affected by a scheme will have to be given notice of an application for an order in a form that lets him know exactly how he is to be affected. I trust that, having received that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I am satisfied with that explanation and I am tempted to ask for further explanation, but the Committee is keen to make progress. We shall no doubt want to study the Minister's words with care and perhaps return to the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 32, line 13, leave out from "rights" to end of line 14.

The amendment applies to paragraph 6, which deals with the
	<br><blockquote><p>"conferring on persons providing transport services of rights to use systems belonging to others."</p></blockquote>
That is mystifying, or it has grave and important implications. There is a difference between those who provide transport services and those who own the system. If the provision is applied to railways, it would be possible for someone who does not own the system the track or the signalling to offer a bulk goods system and, by use of private-owner wagons and a locomotive, to provide a transport service. The provision gives the Secretary of State power to tell the owner of the system that he must allow the provider of the transport service to use the track.

That example takes us back to the 19th century, when the problem arose in these Committee Rooms and what should happen about running rights was discussed. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South may know of the celebrated occasion when a locomotive was locked in a siding in South Kensington station by the servants of the metropolitan railway company because the engine was owned by the district railway company. That is historical fact. The Bill would give the gentleman who runs Virgin Atlantic powers to run trains—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing whether that is good or bad, but he would be able to run trains from Gatwick to Victoria even if British Rail or any successor private company did not wish that to happen. The schedule provides the Minister with an extraordinary extension of power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of paragraph 6 of schedule 1 is to enable orders to confer on persons providing public transport systems the right to use the systems belonging to others. For example, if one railway operator denied access to its track to another operator's trains, an order could be made compelling that company to allow through-running by the second operator. This is a useful reserve power to bring about improvements in local public transport services, or where a preserved railway runs over British Railway metals to the nearest station. There is nothing sinister in the proposal. The hon. Gentleman has nothing to fear by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we let the matter rest, does the Minister know of any examples? The railway from Minehead to Taunton stops just short because agreement has not been reached with British Rail for the connection of the short section between the private railway and the public system. I should like to know more about the safety provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements that we made with British Rail for the Keighley and Worth Valley light railway were extended. We can travel along a section that has a double use by British Rail and the Keighley and Worth Valley light railway. Important factors are involved. Let us suppose that a private operator's train is derailed and fouls an adjacent running line. There are rules by which detonators are placed at a distance in the direction of trains, but traffic could move in both directions on the running line. If a derailment occurs, three detonators, a certain number of yards apart, have to be placed at a safe distance in both directions of travel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negotiations have taken place between Keighley and Worth Valley railway and British Rail. They were slow because British Rail wanted to ensure the proper safe operation of their railway tracks. It is not good enough for the Minister to take power because of some ideological commitment and not include reference to safety standards. That was considered in discussions between Minehead railway, which runs into Taunton, and British Rail. It may be difficult for British Rail to achieve a solution because point work, such as a trap for facing points is involved. If

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
a locomotive goes over facing points that are set the wrong way, it is automatically derailed. British Rail has to cost the installation of those points, which may cost several thousand pounds. A private railway will not be able to pay that. Would British Rail be required to make expensive track alterations to accommodate private operators? The Minister must explain the provision a little better. It grants extensive powers, which have many implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Bradford, South. The provision does not seek to override the important role played by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate. Any safety implications would have to be approved, and fulfil the requirements of the order. The provision would not override any safety requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, South mentioned an agreement that had already been reached between the Keighley and Worth Valley light railway, and British Rail. The Bill provides the opportunity for an order to be made. It would be subject to the usual procedure of promotion, serving notices and possibly holding a public inquiry. A Minister could not automatically make such an order simply by signing a particular document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw one of the Minister's advisers shaking his head when I suggested that some costs might be imposed on British Rail. However, an order might be made, under which a right of entry on to British Rail was granted subject to safety installation. The railway inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive might say that the installations were required. If the Minister then said that that section of railway had to be used, that would impose an obligation on British Rail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those points would be discussed when the order was being made. The order would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
cover costs and who would bear the responsibility for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South gave a good example of an instance where another railway would have to be considered under the order. However, a whole range of considerations exists for providers of services who do not have comparable railway experience. The rights of a system that belong to another person are not properly protected in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering, not works, but law and rights. They should be examined again and perhaps added to the Bill, to replace the obscrue reference in the schedule.
