<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p>[<i>Continuation from Col. 332</i>]</p>
<p>8.45 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 5, line 10, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) The Secretary of State shall require a report to be made to Parliament, not more than six months after the implementation of this Part, on the financial effects of liability to council tax on those in dwellings owned by another person.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 156, in clause 76, page 50, line 8, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) The Secretary of State shall require a report to be made to Parliament, not more than six months after the implementation of this Part, on the financial effects of liability to council tax on those in dwellings owned by another person.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment to highlight the problems faced by people who rent from private landlords, and to discover whether the Government recognise that often a landlord will pass all or part of the council tax for which he is liable to his tenants. We want to know if the Government will do anything to protect tenants.<br><br>
When the poll tax was introduced, those who rented in the private sector had the charge imposed on their rent. The landlord benefited from the abolition of rates. Pressures on available property for renting meant that most tenants had no choice but to accept the situation. Will the Government consider introducing a tenants' band, a discount for tenants or perhaps changes requiring the landlord to pay the council tax? None of those things will be plausible or easy to implement. A report to Parliament six months after the implementation of this part of the Bill would enable us to discover whether tenants were getting a raw deal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) for raising this important issue. Like me, she knows that many people have had unfortunate experiences with landlords, often in the private sector. It is for individual owners or landlords to decide how taxation will be reflected in rents. Landlords account separately for some costs but not for others. They do not have to account separately for overheads such as gas, electricity and water when determining rents, and it is not appropriate that they should be under a duty to account separately for the council tax. However, there is an important distinction which I shall make shortly.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
The hon. Lady knows that the effect of her amendment would not be what she or I would wish. It would require the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on every individual who did not own their property but was liable for council tax. That would be impracticable as it would mean identifying every tenant in England, Scotland and Wales and asking them to provide details of their personal finances. It would, in effect, be a national census of tenants.<br><br>
The council tax has many benefits, one of which is ease of administration. The simple, non-intrusive discount system would be lost if local authorities were asked to provide names and addresses of tenants. The hon. Lady may be suggesting that local authorities should keep a register, which we certainly do not want.<br><br>
It will be for households to decide how a bill, which may include the council tax, should be divided between those living in a property. They must make the appropriate financial arrangements among themselves. The best approach for houses in multiple occupation is to make the landlord or owner of the property liable for the council tax. We intend to do that under clause 8. It will be up to the landlord or owner to arrange contributions from residents towards rent, as with other overhead costs. In such a case the residents would not be liable and would not fall within the scope of the hon. Lady's amendment.<br><br>
Although I am sympathetic to the hon. Lady's point, it is up to tenants to ensure that they are aware of their liabilities and know what their landlord proposes in respect of the council tax and whether he intends to include a direct liability for the tax, which is levied on him as the owner rather than on them as the residents. A tenants' band is impractical. It would negate the objective—to relate payment to the property's value for the half of the tax that is based on property values.<br><br>
Similarly, it would be difficult to create a discount system for tenants, rather than the system that we propose. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising an issue that will affect many people across the country. We are aware of that, but it is not in the scope of the Bill to trespass on landlord and tenant legislation. I accept the hon. Lady's point but I resist the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall wish to discuss the relationship between tenants and their landlords, and their billing arrangements, under amendment No. 96 to clause 8. We shall await the Minister's reflections on a reasonable suggestion that no gentleman such as he could refuse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. I shall reply to his amendment, and his last point does not apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember last year's debate on capping. Then, the hard man gave and the soft man did not. We look forward to that tonight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving the amendment a sympathetic hearing. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
understood the point. I realise that he can do little about it.<br><br>
I shall give a quick example of the problem. Young couples in rural areas who are seeking a house but who find that there is nothing on offer, have no choice about where they go. No housing is available because councils can no longer build houses to replace those that they have sold. There is no low-cost, affordable housing because local people have often been priced out of the market. Such couples would be forced to take scarce rented accommodation and would be at the mercy of landlords. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I am, perhaps typically from the Scottish point of view, in some difficulty. Clause 75 is the Scottish equivalent of clause 6. Government amendment No. 117 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"page 50, line 4, leave out 'owner' and insert 'person entitled to possession'."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand that amendment. It may be significant; it may be meaningless. It is unlikely, however, that we shall have an opportunity to debate it. It would be feasible for the Government to make major changes to the Bill's potential effect on Scotland. We would be unable to debate any amendments that they tabled because they have rigged the guillotine procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, that is not a point of order for me. The hon. Member's point cannot be tackled until we discuss clause 75 because of the schedule under the guillotine. However, what I am about to say will give the Committee an opportunity to reach that clause.<br><br>
I have considered the debate carefully. We have spent six hours and 10 minutes on clause 6. I am of the opinion that the principle of the clause has been adequately discussed in the course of the amendments proposed to it, and I will therefore put the Question on clause stand part forthwith, pursuant to Standing Orders Nos. 67 and 89(3).</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF CARAVANS AND BOATS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is far too fast in agreeing to the Question. He may wonder why a Scottish Member rises to take part in a stand part debate on a clause that applies to England. As no one else has risen, I shall make a simple point on clause 7, which has no Scottish equivalent. Whenever I examine the Government's proposed legislation, I ask myself who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
will be disadvantaged by it. As a Scottish Member, I always try to ascertain whether Scotland will be disadvantaged.<br><br>
Clause 7 is remarkable. It provides that if someone lives on a boat, goes away for a couple of days and allows his brother to stay on the boat, his brother will pay the council tax on that boat for two days. Every time the owner goes away and allows someone to stay on the boat, that person will have to pay the council tax. That is also true of a caravan. However, the Bill's Scottish provisions in respect of caravans are covered by clause 72(2)(c), which states that a "dwelling"
<br><blockquote><p>"does not include a caravan which is not a person's sole or main residence."</p></blockquote>
In Scotland, a person whose sole or main residence is a caravan will always pay the council tax. In England and Wales, it is different. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) who claims to be an expert on caravans, although I do not know whether he is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert on caravans, but I am an adviser to the British Holiday Homes and Home Parks Association. Before the hon. Gentleman accuses me of making large sums of money out of that, I advise him to see what I declare in the list of Members' interests.<br><br>
I have spent much of the past 12 years drawing attention to the anomalies that exist between the rating of caravans in Scotland and south of the border. I am optimistic that this Bill will achieve the right solution by treating both categories in the same way.</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point that I am trying to make. There is a clause in the part of the Bill that affects England that does not appear in the part that affects Scotland. Therefore, we must assume that the Bill, far from putting things right, will make matters worse. I am always interested in what the hon. Member for Tayside, North says. I have heard him speak many times—far too many times—over the past 12 years. He normally manages to relate his contributions to some personal expertise or experience that he has had. It is one of the regrets of my parliamentary career that the one occasion on which the hon. Gentleman did not use that tactic was in a debate on sex shops. I should have been keen to learn about his personal experience of sex shops, but he never told us.<br><br>
I am sure that the Scottish Minister is desperate to intervene to speak to the only clause in the English part of the Bill that is not related to Scotland and which has no Scottish equivalent. There have been all sorts of Scottish debates in which he could have taken part had he been here, but suddenly he is ready to speak to a clause that has no Scottish equivalent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must be careful now. I have ruled that the principle of clause 6 has been dealt with in the amendments that we have considered.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
As a result, I conclude that nothing remains for consideration in clause 6.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is clause 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The ruling applies to clause 7, too. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has expressed his sincere anxiety about the council tax in Scotland. The provisions for Scotland begin at clause 70, but are not included in the equivalent provisions for England and Wales in clauses 6 and 7. Although I am happy to allow a few minutes to air this problem, the Committee's responsibility is to deal with the Bill as it stands for England and Wales. It is hard cheese that we should have such a problem, but I do not see how matters relating to Scotland can be settled adequately before we get to clause 70.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. You have suggested that it is irrelevant for us to raise Scottish issues under clause 7 because similar proposals relating to Scotland are included in the Bill after clause 70. Yet my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was only surmising that there may be some connection between clause 7 and clause 72. It would be nice if the Scottish Minister earned his money and answered my hon. Friend's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is correct on the detail of clause 72. However, the provisions for the Scottish council tax begin at clause 70. The interesting feature is that the hon. Member for Cathcart has spotted an anomaly in the proposals for Scotland that sincerely concerns him but which he cannot deal with because we are discussing the tax in England and Wales. The sooner we reach clause 70, the better. The hon. Gentleman will then have a material point to put to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even though I am a Scottish Member, Mr. Leadbitter, I am presumably entitled to speak about the detail of clause 7. If you were suddenly to rule that Scottish Members were not entitled to speak on English clauses, that would cause even more anger about the Bill than has so far been the case in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The timetable is rigid and we must try to meet the hon. Member's concern and reach clauses 70, 71 and 72 as quickly as possible. He cannot legitimately deal with the problem under England and Wales council tax clauses, which we are now discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. This is disgraceful. It means that the position of caravan owners in Scotland, which interests the hon. Member for Tayside, North, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe), other hon. Members and me, will not be discussed in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate, but that is the way in which the Bill is drafted. The Chair believes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
in considerable flexibility after dinner. To hon. Member's with a Scottish interest, I say that the sooner we get to clause 70, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Perhaps we can resolve the matter by accepting that later clauses are not specifically related to clause 7, but that clause 7 can be debated in its own right on clause stand part. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has already made a contribution, and I want to make a short intervention on the substance of clause 7. No matter how fast we get past clause 7, we shall reach clause 13 by the guillotine that falls next Tuesday evening. If you will make the necessary ruling, Mr. Leadbitter, we could have a short debate on the substance of the clause, without relating it to other clauses or other issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From long practice in the House of Commons, I know that a degree of flexibility is essential at this time in a Committee's sittings. That is normal custom, so the Chair does not mind. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) spoke about the substance of clause 7, which is English legislation. The Chair will help: Scottish matters can be raised in passing. As long as hon. Members concentrate on the substance of the clause, they are technically correct under standing orders, but with a good deal of parliamentary craft they can mention in passing what they must mention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a Scottish Member raised the matter first, perhaps the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) and others will wait a while. I shall call the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are some Scottish Members who represent English constituencies and it would be well in order for them to discuss the clause, if they had an opportunity to do so amid the points of order from Scottish Members. May we have a contribution from Scottish Members who represent English constituencies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek an assurance from my hon. Friend on one or two points. Clause 7(1) deals with a
<br><blockquote><p>"chargeable dwelling which consists of a pitch occupied".</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend assure me that the Bill, recognises, as it were, the anomalies that existed under the rating system in connection with caravans? Coupled with what will take place later, subject to our having the opportunity to debate the matter, the provisions will remove those anomalies that, sadly, continued under the community charge. The assurance for which I am seeking relates to the British Holiday and Home Parks Association, which covers Scotland as well as England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The association wants equity throughout the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we debated the liability of caravan residents under the poll tax legislation, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
ran into considerable difficulties. Some of those difficulties were resolved by the application of the business rate to caravan parks. Generally caravans are not worth more than £10,000 or £11,000 and are obviously different residential dwellings from, say, a small house. Because of the banding system, those who occupy a caravan or a boat as their sole residence will be severely disadvantaged. That would not be so if there were a band with an upper limit of £15,000. As there is no such band, caravan owners will be penalised under the Bill. We have not tabled specific amendments on the issue as we believe that the Government are willing to consider it. Some protection should be afforded to those whose income is reflected in their permanent occupation in caravans. We recognise the difficulties that they will face and we have sympathy with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two or three questions to put to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the Scottish Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make my own speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but to the Scottish Minister, not the other one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just the way that my eyes are! They have been like that since the midwife dropped me. That is my mother's excuse and she is sticking to it.<br><br>
Under the Caravan Sites Act 1968, local authorities in England and Wales were allowed to designate official pitches in their areas. Those pitches are either controlled directly by a warden or by someone living on the site who was employed after consultation with the National Gypsy Council. Will the Minister issue, at an early stage, an advice note on banding to local authorities with designated sites in their areas? Will he also discuss with the National Gypsy Council the implementation of the proposals? Unless consultation takes place with the NGC and the local authorities, problems will arise in terms of the payment and collection of the tax. It would be useful if the Department could produce a leaflet which is then made available to local authorities for distribution to the gypsy community.<br><br>
Several charities in the United Kingdom own or rent caravans for use by disabled or terminally ill people and their families for short stays. Will those disabled or terminally ill people who use caravans for respite care be excluded from any payments? That concession would cover only a few caravans and sites, but, at least, it would ensure that a caravan purchased specifically to assist disabled and terminally ill people would not fall within a banding that attracts payment. Most caravans used for respite care are kept by small local charities with a small income. A tax payment of £200 or £300 a year would be the equivalent of sending one or two disabled people for respite care.<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
I am not asking the Minister for an off-the-cuff answer tonight, but will he write to members of the Committee about the matter and return to it at a later date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The notes on clause 7 say that subsection (5) provides a definition of "caravan". I thought that I knew what a caravan was. Clause 7(5) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In this section 'caravan' shall be construed in accordance with Part I of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960."</p></blockquote>
That does not help much. It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us what part I of the 1960 Act says. Can he assure us that the same definition will apply in Scots law? I appreciate the advice given by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) but definitive answers must come from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to reply for the Minister, but I think that the same definition applies but in a slightly different way. Reference is made to the definition of caravans in the Scottish part of the Bill in clause 72(3), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"'caravan' has the same meaning as it has in Part I of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960."</p></blockquote>
But it seems to cover a different set of caravans from those in clause 7, even though the same act is referred to.<br><br>
There are considerable difficulties with defining caravans. If someone tows a caravan behind the car and puts it on a site for a couple of weeks, there is no problem, because it clearly is not a permanent home. But large moveable homes are another issue. They are put on a site for which a rent is quite often paid, sometimes a considerable one. Mains water, electricity and telephones can all be connected. Some caravans are permanent homes on sites such as the one at St. Andrews, which is a large site. I am sorry, I should not give that example. Nevermind, I shall try it any way.<br><br>
People reside in those caravans all the time and, therefore, in the terms of the Bill, they become dwellings wherever they are in the United Kingdom. The people who live in them will pay council tax. Next door to the permanent dwelling may be a caravan which is exactly the same size with exactly the same facilities. In Scotland, under the Bill, it will not even be defined as a second home, but as a caravan on which no tax will be paid. Only the rent will be paid to the site owner. [<i>Interruption</i>]<br><br>
I can hear someone muttering that rates will be paid on the site. That is true, but those are rates paid by the owner of the whole site. A permanent resident paying the council tax will also be contributing towards those rates. I do not think that his rent will be different from that of the person who rents an identical caravan as a holiday home.<br><br>
It now transpires from what the hon. Member for Tayside, North has said that a person who has such a caravan as a permanent home, resides in it as a dwelling and pays council tax—people who live in such circumstances are not well-off—will also be contributing to the non-domestic rates through the rent that he pays. So an anomaly is being created
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
for what are essentially holiday homes, because the charge on a bungalow that was a holiday home would be 50 per cent of the council tax.<br><br>
Four years ago, when we considered the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Bill in Committee, the Government decided that, regardless of its amenities, a caravan is not suitable for occupation throughout the whole year because the shell is not thick enough to insulate it during winter months. Will that definition still apply? If so, it means that poor people who live in caravans throughout the year will get out of paying the council tax. If that is the position, I am glad, but some caravans that are basically second homes are capable of being lived in for 12 months a year. I know people who have large residential caravans at Aviemore that are deliberately designed for winter occupation because thay are used when the owners ski at the weekends. They are well-built and valuable caravans, and they are used as second homes. Where do we draw the line?<br><br>
Finally, on caravans, I remember going to a fair in Castlemilk in my constituency and visiting the caravan of the person who owned the whole fair. It was luxurious. It was not quite the length of the Committee Room, but it was not far off. It was capable of being towed and was fitted out inside in the most luxurious manner.<br><br>
As there are so many anomalies in classifying caravans I shall be fascinated to hear what the Minister has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I can justify the hope of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that I shall fascinate him, but as a committed supporter of the Union I am glad to confirm that the clause applies solely to England and Wales.<br><br>
The clause provides for special rules on the liability of pitches occupied by caravan or a mooring occupied by a boat where it is the sole, or main, residence of a person. The debate rightly concentrated on caravans rather than on moorings.<br><br>
In England and Wales certain moorings occupied by a boat are classified as domestic property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Houseboats.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, houseboats essentially, so the resident will be liable for the council tax in the usual way. There are no similar Scottish provisions. Moorings in Scotland will be liable for non-domestic rates.<br><br>
The debate on caravans has revealed considerable expertise on both sides of the Committee. The experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) on the issue is well known. The subsection is necessary because the definition of liability in clause 6(2) is inappropriate for caravans in England and Wales. There is no such problem, if I may briefly cover the Scottish position—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In passing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: En passant. We are speaking the language of the auld alliance. There is no such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
problem in the Scottish provision, clause 75(2), under which a resident of a caravan will pay the council tax in the usual way if he is the resident owner, a resident tenant or other sort of resident. If there is no one in those categories, the caravan will be liable for non-domestic rates in the usual way. That is the reason for the clause. I assure the hon. Member for Cathcart that neither England nor Scotland is disadvantaged as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If someone has bought a small plot of land, installed a caravan which cannot be moved without difficulty, which is plumbed in to the water system and so on and he uses the caravan only as a holiday home, under what category would it come? Would that caravan be liable for domestic council tax as a holiday home in the same way as a bungalow or other holiday home, for the normal council tax as a residence or for non-domestic rates? If it is used only for personal use on weekends and in the summer, no income is involved. How can it be taxed on that basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with caravans on holiday sites in a moment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North referred to past anomalies. Those have been recognised in the drafting of clause 7.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Sheffield, Brightside, (Mr. Blunkett) and for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) referred to the banding of luxurious caravans. Caravans that are sole and main residences will be banded in the usual way. Residents of such caravans who are on low incomes will be eligible under the rebate system for rebates up to 100 per cent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) asked whether the definition of caravan was the same on both sides of the border. I assure her that it is.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Makerfield mentioned an advice note. I cannot give a commitment tonight on what form such a note might take, but it was a positive and sensible suggestion which will be followed up. The hon. Gentleman also asked about caravans that are owned by charities and other organisations for short stays. They would not be subject to the council tax because they would not be anyone's sole or main residence.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart asked about caravans on holiday sites. They will be subject, as now, to non-domestic rates. There is no change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two types of caravan site. First, there are large holiday sites, such as those in St. Andrews and in the Under-Secretary's constituency, on which there are 150 or more permanent caravans, that pay the non-domestic rate. I am worried that if a caravan is someone's permanent residence and he pays the same rent as someone for whose caravan is a holiday home, he will have to pay the council tax as well as paying towards the non-domestic rates paid by the owners of the site.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the small site, where someone has bought a piece of land from a farmer and put a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
caravan on it as a permanent holiday residence. It is not used except for holidays and weekends, but it is plumbed in—I am sure that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) knows of such sites in her consituency. Will such caravans be taxed under non-domestic rates—there is no rent on them, there is no income—or will they be taxed as holiday homes? Those concerned are entitled to know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that what I said is correct. Where a caravan is the sole or main residence it will be subject to the council tax, but it will be excluded from the non-domestic rating assessment of the site. That was essentially the point made by the hon. Gentleman. I shall say it again if he wishes to be doubly reassured. Where a caravan is the sole or main residence it will be subject to the council tax, but it will be excluded from the non-domestic rating assessment of the site.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is fine, but we come back to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute and the amendment that will be moved later on the rent paid to the owner of the site who pays the non-domestic rates. If a sole or main residence is not to be included in the assessment, what guarantee will the Minister give us that the owner of the site will not charge the same rent for the person living there permanently as he charges the person who uses it as a holiday home and whose rent includes a rate element?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is down to the site operator and the resident of the domestic caravan to ensure that no amount of non-domestic rate is passed through the rent for the pitch. That is where the advice note, to which the hon. Member for Makerfield referred, could be extremely helpful. The position is absolutely clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is still a little lack of clarity on one point, if my hon. Friend the Minister will forgive me. What will happen to those static caravans that are not occupied by people who declare themselves to be permanent residents either as holiday homes or as permanent residents of static caravans—such as the hippy community and the gipsy community? Will the Minister be kind enough to clarify their position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the local authority assessor to establish whether it is the sole and main residence of any person. Clearly if the caravan is occupied by people who are flitting in and out—if I may use that expression—it will not be anyone's sole or main residence and will be subject to non-domestic rates. I hope that that answers the legitimate queries that have been raised in clause 7, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for answering some of the questions. Despite the fact that he is a Scottish Minister replying to an English clause, he shows more expertise than the English
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
Ministers have shown, and in his answer to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr McCartney) about advice notices he was more courteous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want my hon. Friend to queer my pitch. I assume that if I had asked an English Minister from the Department of the Environment he would have given a similar answer. He can queer his own pitch, but leave mine alone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking lifts from Heathrow in ministerial cars either. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I know I should not be nice to Ministers— I always make that mistake and it always comes down on my head eventually. I once did it to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), an Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, but I shall tell that story another time.<br><br>
The Minister—deliberately or not—did not refer to the holiday caravan that is not on a holiday pitch or a great big park, but on a site bought for that purpose. It is plumbed in; it is a permanent building in that it cannot be shifted and dragged away by car because is has plumbing, electricity and the rest of it. How will that caravan be taxed, or will it be taxed? I am happy for either the Scottish Minister or the pseudo-Minister behind him to reply to that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps when the hon. Gentleman puts his question to the Minister he will ask him also how the situation is affected by the planning approval given for the caravan site in the first place, because it cannot be there without planning consent. The parameters of the use to which it can be put are detailed in the planning consent, and that determines the category in which it is placed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by that argument because planning permission does not necessarily matter in this regard. It will certainly not matter with regard to the council tax on other buildings. Apparently, a person can extend a building with planning permission as many times as he likes without having to change bands.<br><br>
Is such a caravan treated as a caravan or as a second home? As I understand it a holiday caravan should be covered by non-domestic rates but will not be—no non-domestic rates will be payable because there is no income and no way of assessing value. Does it become a holiday home, like the bungalow up the road, in which case a 50 per cent council tax would be payable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for his helpful intervention. He is right to say that special planning consent is required. The key point is whether the caravan meets the definition of a caravan in part I of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. If it is so defined, it is clearly a caravan and therefore subject to non-domestic rates and not to the 50 per cent council tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems, therefore, that that person will pay considerably less than someone with a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
holiday home of the same size. Non-domestic rates for such a single site where there is no income will be practically nil.</span></p>

</ul>
I was not sure whether we would reach this amendment tonight. When the Minister of State replies to the debate, I hope that he will be able to say—perhaps for the first and last time on the Committee—that the Government accept that our amendment is fair and reasonable and non-ideological, and that they agree to it. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am grateful for that burst of applause from behind me.<br><br>
I think that the Government will agree to the amendment because they have often pressed that when council tenants receive a combined rate and rent bill, the rate element—the tax element—should be identified so that people clearly understand what they are paying to their local authority and it is not hidden—that was the expression used on Second Reading.<br><br>
A Conservative Member said that tenants were often misled into believing that there had been a rent increase when in fact there had been a rate increase. He was slightly muddled because it turned out that there had been a rent freeze, so it was not possible for tenants to have misunderstood. Nevertheless, the point was valid. Everyone should know when he or she is paying tax. It should be clearly distinguished from other payments, such as rent. That is accepted by Conservative Members as fair and reasonable for council tenants and we, too, accept that principle. We now accept that when people receive council tax bills, the tax element should be distinguished in the bill however it is paid, and whether it is paid weekly, monthly or by standing order.<br><br>
For private tenancies, primarily multiple-occupation tenancies, the landlord should distinguish that element of the bill due for the tax that he is paying on his tenants' behalf. That, again, is a reasonable principle. It is a simple way to identify liability and we are not opposed to the proposed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
method. We could not be, because that is how it has been done previously and how we want it done under our fair rates.<br><br>
There remains, however, a major problem. When the poll tax was introduced, many private tenants continued paying the same amount of combined rent and rates even though the rates had been abolished. There is no dispute that some landlords pocketed the difference between the rates and the rent. Some private tenants still pay the old rates to their landlords and the poll tax to the local authority. We should not tolerate that iniquity. In my wildest nightmares, I imagine that some landlords tell their tenants that they will pay the poll tax en bloc at the town hall and that the tenants will end up paying the old rates, the poll tax and the new council tax.<br><br>
I do not wish to exaggerate but this is a serious matter. When the new tax is introduced—whether it is the council tax or Labour's fair rates—there is a real danger that tenants will again be at a disadvantage and that they will end up paying more than they should because they will not be able to distinguish between the rent and the various additions. They may realise that the rent has increased, but not how much local tax is being levied on them as individuals living in particular properties.<br><br>
That is a serious matter. It is believed—there is good evidence to substantiate it—that as much as £400 million of rates was paid by tenants to landlords after the rates had been abolished. About £40 million was paid in Scotland and as much as £90 million in London, where there are large tranches of private rented tenancies.<br><br>
We must not allow that to continue. The Government have expressed some sympathy for tenants but have declined to issue an enforceable regulation to make it illegal for landlords to behave it that way. Whatever our feelings about private tenancies, there is no reason why such unfairness should be allowed to continue under the new tax. There are several reasons, the most obvious of which is equity. People should know what element of their rent is made up of tax and what the increase is to enable them to assess which way to vote in local elections. All of us, including Ministers, entirely accept that principle. It is called accountability.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
If rent and rates are confused, there is a danger that the public purse pays housing benefit on sums which are not applicable to housing rents. That is because it will be difficult to identify which is which. That could happen as rents are adjusted in future. Only existing protected tenants are entitled to have rent set by a rent officer, and that in an exclusive property. For most tenancies, there is no immediate redress or way of identifying what the total rent should be. It is also significant in terms of the taper. It is not simply a matter of people applying for benefit—the taper could well be different between the entitlement on rent and the entitlement on the local council or fair rates tax. There is a difference between the payments that have to be made from the Exchequer and from the local taxpayer in meeting that bill. On that count, it is important to have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
matter straight. It is also important in terms of the law so that there is no question of discrediting the Rent Acts or the law on the local council tax on fair rates.<br><br>
For those reasons, I can think of no justification for turning down this reasonable amendment. We accept that it would mean that landlords have to divide premises in terms of the eligible tax to be paid for this purpose. However, they have to do that anyway in levying the amount that they ask each sub-tenant or tenant to pay. They have to do it to raise the necessary amount to pay the local authority in property tax.<br><br>
So there is no excuse for rejecting the amendment. It would not cause the landlord bureaucratic inconvenience. It would not inconvenience the tenant, who needs to know about the changes in local taxation to decide how to cast his or her vote. It would not inconvenience the local authority, which would still receive the block amount due on the property without any further bureaucracy or inconvenience to anyone. Instead, the amendment would identify the eligible and due amount from the tenant and ensure that the landlord did not exploit the situation, either deliberately or by default, when collecting rent and rates together in a block.<br><br>
I challenge the Minister to give a reasonable explanation why the amendment should not be accepted. Then we can all have a decent night's sleep with the knowledge—at least on the Opposition side of the Committee—that there has been some justification for turning up for this committee all week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because the point has been made very well by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). The change from the rates to the poll tax was a serious problem for private tenants in London and there was a great deal of overcharging. It came to about £90 million—it was a hidden rent rise for private tenants in London. Much of that profiteering by landlords, as well as being paid for by private tenants, was backed up by a state subsidy in the form of housing benefit. The state helped tenants to pay that bill. That was not right; money from the public purse could have been better used elsewhere, it is essential to avoid such profiteering in the change-over from the poll tax to the council tax. The Government must insist that landlords do not collect more than they pay out and that tenants are properly notified of the amount for which they are liable so that they are not overcharged. The measures must be stronger in this change-over than they were in the last one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Opposition's argument, which seems reasonable in terms of basic fairness. Everyone should have the maximum amount of information, people who, as part of their rent, pay council tax, should know how much it is but there is a matter of principle: should Governments interfere and tell landlords precisely how they should make that information available?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is astonishing that a Tory Member of Parliament who has voted time and again to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
ensure that public landlords do exactly what the Government tell them should say that private landlords should not be told what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party has never understood the difference between private property and public property. Labour Members think that all private property should be public property, as is evident from their posturing now that they have been converted to the idea of the sale of council houses. They say that private tenants should have the same rights but without understanding that Conservatives are not in favour of the confiscation of private property, even if they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That last remark was rich indeed. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that public standards or that private standards should be much lower than public standards? Is that his justification?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that all too often, those in authority—I refer especially to councils in the light of my experience serving on Labour-controlled local authorities—use the pursuit of fairness and what appears to be a good idea as excuses to trample over people's human rights. It is no use, after a good dinner, for Labour Members to object to these remarks. They know that there is example after example of Labour councils doing that, sometimes for what they believe are good reasons but which are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my learned Friend on his wind-up of the Opposition. I agree with him about pubic sector housing. Does he agree with me that the reason why the Government have had to intervene time and time again in the public sector housing is that successive Labour local authorities, especially those in London, could not care less about the state of housing? They do not spend enough money on repairs and leave a lot of housing derelict. That is why Governments have had to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and I hope that some of us will be able to get out of the Committee next Thursday to make those points to the Labour party on the Floor of the House. That is when Labour Members will make another pathetic attempt to explain their housing policy.<br><br>
Landlords do not have to identify in their bills charges for gas, electricity, maintenance costs or anything else separately, so it would be odd if we were to suggest that they should identify that item separately. It is a silly idea and I shall oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be interesting if the hon. Gentleman would explain why his Government removed the Parker-Morris standards for housing, which is one example of the lowering of standards, and why they have refused to act on houses in multiple occupancy. To make the connection, I was in this Room when the Minister who is now the Secretary of State for Health was trying to support a Conservative council that wanted to take Mr. Hoogstraten to court as one of the bad landlords in this country.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Not on this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought it rich that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) should advocate clarity of accountability. When the Government introduced a tax that achieved it, he denounced it and did everything that he could to oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean the poll tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see clause 8 as applying to a limited number of properties including houses in multiple occupation, such as those containing many bed-sits, hostels, residential homes, monasteries, convents and similar buildings. I do not see it as having a wide application. The question for the Committee is whether it is worth while laying down in legislation a measure that my hon Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) described as a highly intrusive and interfering clause for the sake of identifying separately the tax element for a part of the population. That proved to be difficult in the past because those people are highly mobile.<br><br>
I pondered the question because I regarded it as fair, but I concluded that it is not reasonable to require that of landlords. As my hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
Member for Harrow, West said, they do not identify costs for gas, electricity, water or maintenance separately, so they should not have to provide it for the council tax element. It was typical of Labour Members that they should want to intervene in relations between landlord and tenant and their proposal is rather naive. The rent charged in such places will be what the market can bear and, ultimately, regardless of whether the tax element is shown separately or not, it is unlikely to make any difference to the amount of rent that is being charged.<br><br>
This is a typical motherhood and apple pie amendment from the Labour party which it believes will look good to the ouside world, but it is of limited practical value. The Committee would be unwise to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an extraordinary response. I shall weigh the Minister's words between now and the time we reconvene. We are talking about people who are often vulnerable in their relationship with their landlords and we want to give them simple, easy rights.</span></p>
