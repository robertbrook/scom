	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday evening I spoke informally to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). He recalled that on a previous occasion I had likened him to Sancho Panza, Don Quixote's right-hand man. He obviously remembered that jibe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West deserved the title again last night because he took a tilt at another windmill in the early part of his speech. He asked me to guarantee that when we institute the council tax benefit scheme, we will not claw back the amounts that were put into benefit under the current arrangements for the community charge. He asked me to guarantee that we would not reduce the rates of benefit because benefits under the council tax will apply to 100 per cent of the bill and to a maximum of 80 per cent of the bill. His plea to me was unnecessary because the Government have already guaranteed that there will be no clawback in 1993 when the council tax is introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the point of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the point of the argument. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is wrong to yell out from a sedentary position, but he is right if he is implying that the hon. Member for Leeds, West made other arguments. I shall come to those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guarantee has been given. It was something of a surprise as it had not been anticipated that the Government would make that decision and announce it a year in advance. We are talking about the benefit rates that will apply from April 1993, an
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>
uprating that would conventionally be announced as soon as possible after and in line with the retail prices index of September 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I presume that at some point in his reply, the hon. Gentleman will deal with the crucial question of why the 20 per cent contribution is not to be abolished from April 1992? That would facilitate the collection of the poll tax in its final year and allow local authorities to deal sensibly with the crisis in revenue raising powers and to prepare for the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention is an unusually impatient one from the hon. Gentleman. I have only been speaking for two minutes and I am replying to a debate that lasted about two hours. Of course, I intend to reply, as I hope I always do, to the points that were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) began his speech by questioning the cost of the Government's intention not to claw back those moneys that had been added to people's social security benefit so that they could meet the 20 per cent contribution to the community charge. He questioned the figure that the Government announced of £680 million. I shall remind him what that figure is based on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fair point of comparison is that by April 1993, income-related benefits will be some £680 million more than would have been required to compensate for inflation since 1989. That £680 million will be spread among 8 million people. There are different ways of measuring it, but it is perfectly fair to ask to what extent we are paying more benefit than we would have been if we had continued to uprate benefits in line with inflation. The key factor in the equation is the amount added to benefits to pay the 20 per cent contribution to the community charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister; I now understand the difference between the answer given to me by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security on 12 November, which put the figure at £580 million and the figure announced on Thursday of £680 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can we glean from the fact that when my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) asked the same question in May, the figure was £380 million? When I asked the question in June, it was £440 million. There are four different figures, only one of which I understand. I do not, however, understand the differences between the figures given in May, June and November. Perhaps the Minister, who was once a Social Security Minister, can enlighten us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The complexities involved in being a Social Security Minister are almost the only decent training for being a Minister for Local Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer depends largely on the question asked. I shall deal with the £440 million figure in a moment. The hon. Member for Brightside is right to say that there are different figures, depending on what is measured. I shall try to explain each in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>919</span>
The hon. Gentleman challenged the £680 million. He said that it should be reduced by some other figures. First, he wanted to reduce it by £200 million, an amount that was somehow being withdrawn from the system by the Government. I have searched my mind in an attempt to discover where that figure could have come from and I think I have found the answer. The estimated costs of council tax benefit in 1993–94 are about £1.1 billion. The community charge benefit expenditure for this year is an estimated £1.3 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has said that £200 million has somehow been withdrawn. However, he must recognise that the number of beneficiaries under a council tax system is different from the number of beneficiaries under a community charge system because council tax is a household bill. There will be 22 million council tax bills instead of 42 million community charge bills. Crucially, the third, fourth and fifth adults in a household are not brought into account under the council tax as they are in the community charge system. At the moment, the third or fourth adult in a household may apply for benefit in respect of his community charge bills. Those people do not come into the picture at all under the council tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment, this is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Brightside is serious in arguing that £200 million should be deducted, the base from which he started would also be wrong. When we moved from the rating system to the community charge system, the amount paid in community charge benefit was much higher than the amount of benefit paid under the rates, because more people paid the community charge. When we switched from rates to community charge, the amount paid in benefit rose from about £1.4 billion to about £2.2 billion—an increase of about £800 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arithmetic of the hon. Member for Brightside is invalid anyway, but if he were to pursue his argument he would have to say, first, that the whole thing was jacked up by £800 million and, secondly, as we return to a property-based system, that there would be a reduction in the benefit payable. If the hon. Gentleman was advocating fair rates, which is his party's policy, he would have to argue that there would be fewer bills and fewer people who would be liable and therefore less need for benefits. One follows the other as night follows day and the hon. Gentleman's argument is not correct. The hon. Member for Cathcart does not now want me to give way. He has settled in his place, which is good news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brightside produced another figure—£250 million—by delving into the history of social security in a manner that might have shaken off some observers, but would have kept the attention of the hon. Members for Makerfild (Mr. McCartney) and for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) and my hon. Friends the Members for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) and for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and other assembled experts on social security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
The hon. Member for Brightside went back to 1985, when the Government published their White Paper on the reform of social security benefits. An annex to the paper contained illustrative figures about what benefit rates might be in 1988. The Government said then that, in 1988, they would pay the benefits appropriate to 1988 and not the ones that had been dreamed up in 1985. The period 1985 to 1988 experienced falling inflation, so the 1985 estimates were not applicable to 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988 the Government introduced actual benefit rates—the famous 50p that the Labour party calls a "deduction" from social security benefit rates. Of course, it was not a deduction, but an actual rate, appropriate to 1988, which was substituted for the illustrative rate published in 1985. Even if one accepts the argument of the hon. Member for Brightside, which the Committee would not be inclined to do, it is difficult to understand how he came up with the figure of £250 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure is drawn from an answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) on 18 November, which showed the sum to be £210 million without the proposed 19.1 per cent uprating since 1988, which lifts the sum to £250 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, but the question is still one of garbage in, garbage out. If one starts with an invalid figure and multiplies it by a given factor— whatever that might be—the figure that one ends up with is, not surprisingly, invalid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was underwhelmed by the welcome that the hon. Member for Brightside gave to our proposals. He might have been more generous. The non-clawback of the social security benefits, which is worth £680 million on social security benefits that are paid to 8 million people is, at a time when public expenditure is not easy to come by, a pretty good settlement. It is a tribute to the way in which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security has handled his budget and to the enlightened attitude of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The hon. Member for Brightside probably felt that it was a much better package for people on low income than he was able to let on to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred earlier to garbage in, garbage out with regard to questions asked and has just praised Ministers for using money properly on behalf of taxpayers. Therefore, why it is rational and acceptable to maintain the 20 per cent contribution that people cannot afford to pay? The £140 compensation did not match the 20 per cent contribution in Bristol. If the Minister thinks that it is reasonable to allow £15 of taxpayers' money to be spent to collect £6 of outstanding debts in Bristol, how does he square it with his comments about the importance of using public finance properly? Surely it would be better to cut the losses and save the £8 that would otherwise be wasted on administration costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is exhibiting the impatience of the hon. Member for Brightside. I

	<span class='label label-info column'>921</span>
realise that she becomes frustrated having to listen to the hour-long speeches of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) which never reach the point, but my speech will not last an hour and it will come to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But will it answer the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will certainly deal with the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as the hon. Gentleman's intervention lasts less than an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister tempts Opposition Members to subject him to the same barrage of interventions that accounted for one or two of my speeches lasting longer than I intended. He has now been speaking for 15 minutes. If he believes that the point is answered so easily, why cannot he answer my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) directly and save a great deal of time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45. am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not save any time, because I have to deal with points made during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention, rather than during his speech, the hon. Member for Makerfield referred to the taper hitting the thrifty. He misunderstood. In any social security benefit, we must ensure that the maximum amount of benefit available is paid to those who are at the lowest level, usually defined as those on the income support level. As people's incomes rise above that level, they are gradually eased off the benefit. [Hon. Members: "Eased off."] There is no way that the problem can be avoided. The alternatives are a taper—a gradual reduction of benefit payable as income rises—or a cut-off point, below which one receives benefit and above which one does not. In jargon, a cut-off point is called a cliff edge. It is most unsatisfactory, because if one is a fraction above the permitted level, all benefit is lost and one is worse off than if one had not had that increase in income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best method is to apply a taper. We have to decide the appropriate level of the taper. Until now, the maximum amount of benefit has been 80 per cent, leaving the claimant to pay 20 per cent of the bill. The claimant has been eased out of benefit at the rate of 15p for every £1 of extra income. But, because the new benefit scale will run to 100 per cent, a different rate of taper is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can have arguments above how the taper and the different levels of benefit relate. Running benefit to 100 per cent and removing benefit at 20p for every additional £1 of income is broadly equivalent to giving benefit up to only an 80 per cent maximum and reducing the amount of benefit by 15p for every extra £1. If one had wanted to achieve exact arithmetic equivalence between the two, the new taper would have been 18.75 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Opposition Members raised a point from the briefing given to them by the Child Poverty Action Group. They referred to an example of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
particular person on a particular level of income who, when faced with the same bill under the council tax and the community charge, would be worse off under council tax benefit. Of course, the level of one's bill and income matter. That example has been carefully chosen on the basis of two assumptions: first, that the income is at a certain level—in income support terms, that would be relatively high—and, secondly, that the bill is the same under the council tax as under the community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people's bills will be different under the two systems. We have concluded from the family expenditure survey that, broadly speaking and on average, the benefit will be available up to the same income level under the council tax as under the community charge. Where people's bills are higher, another element will have to be brought into the equation. We are in favour of transitional relief to reduce council tax bills that are higher than community charge bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Labour party is implacably opposed to paying transitional relief in those circumstances, but the Government are in favour of it. Transitional relief initially will reduce higher bills, and the benefit will be payable upon that. In any case, people with higher bills may often be able to receive benefit up to a higher level of income. In any case, because the council tax will be based on a property as well as a personal element and because a number of social security claimants will live in low-value properties, those claimants may well receive a lower bill in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points to make, to which I hope that the Minister will be able to respond. There is another side to the taper that could severely affect the calculation of a person's benefit entitlement, namely, the assumed percentage rate of interest on capital. The Government assume that that rate will be about 20 per cent, which is more than any rate of return on any of the Government's own investments. That is an artificially high assumed rate. As a result, pensioner couples' entitlement to benefit will fall out of the taper very rapidly, even though their capital income is very low. The assumed rate is never achieved in practice, and is in fact impossible, even if there is a big hike in interest rates for depositors, because of such a couple's small capital investment base. However, those couples will lose their right to assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly—and I am talking off the top of my head—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to answer that? It might help my brain if he will permit me to deal with one point at a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a fair amount of misrepresentation of tariff income. It does not set out to be a measure of the interest that can be realised on capital, but to be a taper in itself. It is a way of reducing the amount of benefit payable to people as their capital increases. It is logical, and I know that the Oppostion would hate benefit to be paid to people with large amounts of capital. Their demonology is full of rich people and millionaires, but they know that, at some point, account must be taken of capital as well as of income.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
How should a taper be formulated? The Government's answer is not to make assumptions about rates of interest, but to assume that £1 of income will arise from every £250 above the first £3,000. The first £3,000 is exempt from the tariff. The hon. Gentleman will realise that someone who has £3,250 of capital is assumed to have an income of only £1 a week on that capital. It is quite false to draw analogies with interest rates, but if one were to do so, that would correspond to an interst rate of about 1.6 per cent. In any case, we then say that that means another £1 of income for that person, which will reduce that person's benefit by 20p under the council tax benefit and by 15p under community charge benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only false to talk in terms of a rate of interest on the capital but wrong to imply that we knock off a person's benefit. It is simply applied to the other tapers so that £1 of income from capital means a 15p reduction in benefit and so on up the scale, up to a £16,000 maximum. That seems a fan-way of dealing with capital because it takes into account the fact that people have capital and should draw on it, and because capital can generate some income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that many of his hon. Friends have raised with him and with colleagues in the Department of Social Security their considerable worry at the way that the current taper applies a 15p loss in the pound, while the loss in the pound under the council tax will be very much worse, at 20p? The applied or assumed rate of interest is 20.8 per cent. Who gets 20.8 per cent on an investment in a building society or even in privatised utilities, which have been the biggest giveaway in British history? No one gets 20.8 per cent, yet that is the assumed rate of interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue my reply to the hon. Member for Brightside. This is not an assumption about interest; it is a taper to reduce the amount of benefit which is payable to people with capital. In any case, there are
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
two stages. One is to assume an income based on that capital and the second is to take that income and apply it to the taper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman refers to my hon. Friends and their worries. I sometimes think that my hon. Friends believe that we have assumed that £16,000 in capital produces quite a large income which is then deducted from benefit. That is not what happens. It then gets applied to the taper so that each £1 which we are taking into account reduces benefit by only 15p—by 20p under the council tax benefits system. If my hon. Friends were worried about the change in the taper, they would also recognise that benefit will be payable at a higher level—it will be payable on 100 per cent of the bill, not 80 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot get away with this. It is little wonder that this sort of attempt at sophistry so angers Opposition Members and all those outside the Committee who have to face the reality which the Minister is trying to duck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot take refuge in the fact that he is making the calculation solely for the purpose of tapering out benefit because that is what income for this purpose always does. The real question is whether the calculation of income from capital can be substantiated. Can it be justified? The Minister tries to justify it by establishing a negative. He says that it has nothing to do with interest rates. I understand why he says that: any calculation of a likely interest rate is so improbable as to be laughable. No one gets over 20 per cent interest on capital. If it is not about interest rates, what is it about? How does he justify that calculation? How can he say that a person with £250 capital is assumed to earn an income of £1 a week on that capital? That is a simple, straightforward question for the Minister to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is entirely false. No one makes that assumption. We assume that a person with £3,000 of capital has no income; we assume that someone with £3,250 of capital has £1 a week in income; we assume that someone with £3,500 of capital has £2 a week in income. The hon. Gentleman's assertion that a person with £250 capital is treated as having an income of £1 a week is entirely false. Why should I answer a false question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister attempts to escape from the obligation to describe why £250 capital is assumed to produce £1 income by abandoning what has always been the Government's position; that the first £3,000 of savings are to be disregarded. He now implies that that is to be taken into account. The Government are rigging the calculations against those who have small amounts of savings and who are therefore debarred from receiving the minimal levels of the benefit that the Government provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The explanation which I gave is wholly consistent with the explanations that the Government have given over a long period.—The first £3,000 is to be disregarded. That does not stop us responding to the Labour party's wholly false
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>
accusation that we think that £250 capital produces £1 income a week. A person with £3,250 capital is regarded as having an income of £1 a week. The Labour party has not been in power for 12 years and does not think that it will ever be in power, so it refuses to address serious questions. Labour Members do not wish to pay benefit to people who have largish amounts of capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the social security system, a cliff edge—above which point no benefit is paid but below which point full benefit is paid—produces disastrous and undesirable effects. It also has perverse incentives for people to get rid of savings to receive benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other option is to devise a taper. It is sensible that in the case of capital the taper should be a rising curve. At £3,250 of capital, an income of only £1 a week is assumed. That rises to a number of pounds a week at the higher level. That rising curve takes people gradually out of benefit according to the amount of capital they have. The amount of income that they are assumed to have is applied not pound for pound as a reduction in their benefit but by means of a taper, so that for each £1 of assumed income 15p is removed from community charge benefit and 20p will be removed from council tax benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene. I am happy to give way to him, but I do not want to hear him carping later about the length of my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening so frequently. I did not introduce the issue of the length of speeches. I notice that the Minister is now seeking to use exactly the same excuse that I advanced when he attacked me on the same ground. I do not apologise for making this point yet again. We are at last making progress with the Minister, who is wriggling on a hook of his own creation and is unwilling to offer an explanation of what the Government are really up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the Minister can get away with the argument—at the cost of doing some violence to the principle that the first £3,000 is to be disregarded—that £3,250 a week is assumed to produce £1 a week income. What then happens is that the next £250, irrespective of the original £3,000, is levied at a marginal rate on the assumption that a further £1 a week is received by way of income. No reference can be made a second time to the original £3,000 because it is a marginal calculation. Every additional £250 is assumed to produce £1 a week income. Will the Minister explain how that is calculated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained it several times. It is appropriate to have a rising scale so that the more capital a person owns, the faster the rate at which that person's benefit is reduced. That is achieved by disregarding the first £3,000. If the Labour party wants to compute interest rates, which are irrelevant because it is a tariff on capital, the only honest way to do that is to say that the interest on £3,250 is 1.6
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
per cent, on £3,500 it is marginally more and it rises up the scale to interest of over 20 per cent on £16,000—but, as I said, interest rates are irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are reducing the benefit of people who have more capital. The Labour party would do exactly the same and, if they dispute that, will the hon. Member for Dagenham tell the Committee what tariff income would apply under a Labour Government? How many pounds of benefit would they withdraw for each point on the scale? If he will tell us that, we can end the argument and add the costs of whatever he proposes to the costs of the Labour programme. I do not believe that we shall hear an answer, but I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right—he will not get an answer, because asking a question is the last refuge of every scoundrel who is unwilling to answer a legitimate question about his own proposals. The Minister has given no account whatsoever—except a denial that it has anything to do with interest rates—of how £250 marginal increase in capital is assumed to produce an increase in income of £1 per week. If the Minister will answer that question we shall be in a position to judge the equity of his proposals. If he cannot explain why an additional £250 capital produces an income of £1 per week, let him, at least, have the guts to admit it so that we can condemn him for being heartless and for having no argument to support his heartlessness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's use of the word "scoundrel", or any other personal insult that occurs to him, is his response whenever he finds himself in a corner. Whenever Conservative hon. Members have asked the hon. Gentleman a question about Labour party policy—after all, we are six months away from a general election so it is not unreasonable to ask what its policy would be—he has hurled personal insults because he has no other response. The hon. Gentleman and his Learned Friends would not object to me wriggling—although I have not wriggled—but they object to hearing from a Minister exactly what the Government's policy is, the motivation for that policy and the fact that we are willing to stick to it. The Labour party does not understand sticking to policy because it never has and it believes that to stick to one's policy is, somehow, immoral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has, on several occasions, demonstrated an unusual sensitivity. On this occasion, he has demonstrated not only that, but a complete ignorance of literary allusions. Surely, he recognised that I used the phrase "the last refuge of a scoundrel" because it is a well-known phrase. It was not an attempt to signify that he is a scoundrel, although he may think the description justified as, despite all his bluster, he has still not offered the Committee an answer to my question: how can £250 capital be assumed to produce £1 income per week? If the Minister cannot answer that, can any of his hon. Friends help him out? Would any Conservative Member care to offer an explanation of that simple question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Most of his speeches are peppered with clichés, but I never thought that he would produce that excuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How about an answer now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall go through it one more time for the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not assuming that capital can produce any particular amount by way of interest when it is invested. We are saying that there is a certain level of capital that should disqualify people from benefit. I assume that, on that principle, there is no difference between the two sides of the Committee. If we exclude people from benefit at a certain level of capital, we must have a taper to get from the position where people are allowed benefit to the position where benefit is disallowed altogether. We have constructed a taper: it is called tariff income. We ignore the first £3,000; for each £250 above that we assume £1 of income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because that is the taper which we have constructed. It means that there is a smooth progression to take people out of benefit at a level of £16,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I remind the Committee that the Government have recently doubled the amount of capital that a person is allowed to hold. None the less, it is appropriate that there should be a rising scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's attempt to ascribe to this a rate of interest is misplaced for several reasons. First, it is nothing to do with the amount of money raised on the capital: it is to do with taking people gradually out of benefit. Secondly, even if we were to calculate rates of interest, we should have to recognise that the first £3,000 was exempt, so the rates of interest rise as we go up the scale. That is entirely appropriate. We should have a curving scale to take people out of benefit. Self-evidently, the need to pay benefit at the level of £3,250 capital is much greater than the need to pay benefit at the level of £16,000 capital. Thirdly, the Opposition's attempt to ascribe a rate of interest is false in that the assumed income is then applied to the taper and not directly to the reduction of benefit, so that each £1 reduces the amount of benefit by 15p under this system and by 20p under the council tax benefits system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Of course that is why the hon.

Labour does not have the money; this time the Labour party is being careful—but not careful enough—n(not to make commitments that we can cost. The hon. Member for Dagenham can only say that he disagrees with the system, but there is no commitment as to the way in which a Labour Government would change it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Labour party talks to pensioners and people with savings and criticises the Government's arrangements, it has an absolute obligation to say what changes it would make and how much it would cost. When the hon. Member for Dagenham is challenged on that subject, not only has he no answer but he seeks to wriggle out by insulting Conservative Members. Throughout our proceedings, he has not once been able to take either a direct question or, even more remarkably, a direct explanation of Government policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We all know people who decide to sell their home because it is too big. They move into council or sheltered accommodation and have £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 in the bank from the sale of their house. I am delighted that they move into a council property. But they then complain that their rent is not paid like that of their next-door neighbour who did not have £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 in the bank. In essence, it is a matter of principle. We may argue that the taper is too steep or too shallow, but the Government are right: there must be a cut-off point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes some good points. The immense inconsistency of the Opposition's position is extraordinary. Does my hon. Friend remember that earlier they pursued their concept of an envy tax? They were deeply concerned that people in more expensive properties could have more squeezed out of them under the rating policy than under our policy. They are anxious to wring every last penny out of anyone who has assets in the form of property. However, when we turn from people who cannot realise their asset, because it is their home, to those who have realisable assets in the form of capital in a bank or building society, it is supposed to be wrong for the Government to take account of it.

The Labour party's theme throughout has been targeting; benefit should be given when it is needed and care should be taken not to give a discount to a single person who is not on a low income. Targeting means finding out whether people need benefit by taking account of their income and their capital, and then reducing the benefit to which they are entitled in line with what they have. But the Labour party says, "Oh no, we don't want to touch that." What would the Labour party do that is different? Where are its proposals? They are non-existent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not apologise for our commitment to the principle that those at the top of the scale who are most able to contribute should make a fair, proportionate contribution. The failure of the poll tax to provide for that principle led to the disaster that the Government try to excuse on the ground that the electorate could not be persuaded that the poll tax was fair. The Government have learnt their lesson as it applies to the poll tax but they have not applied it to the council tax.

The Minister has had a more than adequate opportunity to answer the question how it is that £250 of capital is assumed to produce £1 of income. The answer which he has offered, repeatedly, is not an answer. It has nothing to do with interest rates, although that would be one obvious way to calculate it and to justify that assumption. In the absence of a calculation based on a reasonable rate of interest, the Minister offers nothing, except an assertion that this is the way in which the Government have constructed the taper. Our question, which has not been answered, is how are the assumptions to be explained and on what assumptions was the taper constructed? How can one justify the statement that £250 of capital produces £1 of income? I put that on the record because I have given up hope of persuading the Minister to answer that simple question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon.

Let me say once again, and briefly, that it is a method of ensuring that people on a particular level of capital are taken out of benefit. It is a taper to move smoothly from those who have limited amounts of capital to those who have large amounts.

During yesterday's debate, some hon. Members challenged the Government's decision to maintain the 20 per cent contributions to the community charge in its last year. The arguments which I had made in favour of doing that were fairly presented by Opposition Members. We introduced a tax system based on personal contributions and on everyone paying and went to the lengths of ensuring that income support rates and other income-related benefit rates were increased so that 20 per cent of reasonable community charges were covered by the payments that were made. [Hon. Members: "Not all."] Having done all that, it is right for us to continue that practice until the community charge is abolished. The hon. Member for Brightside fell into the trap into which he accused us of falling when he said that we had abolished the community charge because clause 100 had been passed in Committee. The community charge will be with us until April 1993 and it is not finished in Parliament until Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made the point, there were cries from Labour Members that the income support uprating did not cover 20 per cent of all charges. Of course it did not do so in Labour-controlled authorities where the charge was pitched immensely high. Who could expect a Government to raise income support levels to pay community charges of between £500 and £600 in Lambeth? We put into income support an amount that was sufficient to cover the reasonable 20 per cent contributions that people were making. As £140 has been taken off the community charge this year, the increases in benefit have done well. Next year, the amount will be equal to at least £1.40 for a single person and £2.80 for a couple. On average, the community charge will be £257. People who pay a 20 per cent contribution will face a community charge of about £50 a year. So the levels of £1.40 for a single person and £2.80 for a couple will cover the amounts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>931</span>
that most of the people who will have to pay 20 per cent will need to find.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a borough such as Wandsworth, where excellent management has reduced the community chage to zero, all of what has been added to social security benefit will pass directly to those people. However, the Opposition must realise that the money raised to increase benefits with the specific purpose of paying the 20 per cent contribution to the community charge must be raised from taxpayers. The Opposition often forget that not all taxpayers, even those who pay income tax, are rich. Our taxes come from many diverse sources, including people on the lowest incomes. That is how some of the benefits are financed. The Government believe that those taxpayers will demand that people who have been given money to pay their share of the community charge must pay their contributions. That should continue until the community charge ends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never heard so much arrant nonsense. The uprating to take account of the poll tax was made on 1 April 1989, not in 1990. It was based on assumptions about English poll tax levels that did not exist. For a whole year, almost right across Scotland, the Scottish poll tax payer had to face charges that were based on so-called "averages" of non-existent poll taxes in England and Wales. What does the Minister say to the poll tax payer on benefit in Scotland who lost out for 12 months as a result of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I say to any community charge payer anywhere is that the headline charge has been reduced by £140 this year and that the amounts paid into benefit are as I have described.

Last night, much of what was said about the cost of maintaining the 20 per cent contribution to community charge was beside the point. It was asserted that the cost of collecting the 20 per cent was more than the sum raised in the collection. I am not sure how the arithmetic was worked out, but the average 20 per cent contribution in England is about £50. If we assume that between 8 million and 10 million people are on benefit, £400 million to £500 million worth of income is at stake. Our estimate for 1991 -92 is that if, this year, we pay community charge benefit on a 100 per cent basis, the cost will be £440 million. For the coming year, the figure will be slightly higher.

To explain to the hon. Member for Brightside, a previous estimate of £180 million was made for the same thing, but one is an updated estimate of the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that he has seen the Audit Commission's report which concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Chargepayers who receive 80 per cent relief contributed about £6 a year net to the public purse in 1990/91 … the average collection cost per chargepayer was around £15"?</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister conclude from that report that the cost of collecting the 20 per cent is far more than the sum that is collected? That cannot be cost effective. Will he therefore review his decision for 1991–92 and 1992–93?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not remember that passage from the Audit Commission's report. I do not have a copy here and I should like to consider the matter. On the basis of a £250 community charge, the average contribution is £50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall now do an analysis of the £15 collection charge. If the average cost of generating, printing and posting a bill is 75p, the costs per transaction are 1 Op for people paying by direct debit and 45p for people paying over the counter. Summons and liability cost orders, on average, are £20 per head, but those costs can be recovered from the community charge payer who has given rise to them. It is possible to collect the community charge for a low cost in the way which I described. When the community charge payer does not pay, enforcement action will be expensive, but it is recoverable from the community charge payer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>933</span>
It is necessary that enforcement action should continue against all those who fail to pay their community charge. It is vital for all law-abiding people who pay their community charge that there should be no hint of amnesty. That means that, for this year and next year, people will be liable for their community charge contributions and their liability will not end at the end of the community charge. Enforcement action can continue into the year 1993–94 to recover due debts. The debts will include the community charge and the costs incurred from enforcement. It is important to make it clear that there will be no amnesty and to reassure the millions of people, including those on benefit who used the supplement to their benefit to pay their contribution, that enforcement action will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if the Minister is unaware of the Audit Commission's statement, I am sure that he is aware of a point made in the debate on the Community Charges Bill on 26 March 1991 to the effect that 70 per cent of all community charge defaulters are people who are supposed to pay the 20 per cent contribution. That point demonstrates the high cost of collecting from people who pay 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to an amnesty. Does he agree that one can have an amnesty only for something that has happened in the past? Today we have an opportunity of saying that the 20 per cent contribution need not be paid for the financial year 1992–93. In the light of the Audit Commission's report and the point made in the debate on 26 March, will the Minister make collection cost effective for local authorities by removing the 20 per cent contribution in the next financial year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have made it clear on a number of occasions—including during what is now my rather lengthy speech—that the Government do not intend to remove the 20 per cent contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the reasons which I gave when the hon. Gentleman was baying at me so loudly that he could not hear my explanation. There will continue to be a contribution of 20 per cent to the community charge. The money has been provided by taxpayers. The basis of the tax is that there should be a contribution from everyone. When the basis of the tax changes, that will be the time to change the benefit rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) seemed to imply that, because many people do not pay promptly, that should be the occasion and the reason for changing the law. That is an extremely slippery slope. It would mean that whenever the Government found if difficult to collect taxes or enforce any law, they should take that opportunity to rip up the laws and change them. That may be Liberal Democrat policy, but I believe that it is thoroughly undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister allow me to explain that that is not Liberal Democrat policy at all? Has
	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
the hon. Gentleman considered that the very reason that people cannot pay the 20 per cent contribution is that they cannot afford to do so? Of course, this horrendous poll tax is based not only on people's income but on the Government's intention to get as much money out of poor people as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly true that the community charge in general is not based on people's income. But it is for those on low incomes, twice over. First, they receive benefit because they are on a low income; secondly, their benefits are increased to pay the 20 per cent contribution. Although as a rule what the hon. Gentleman says about the community charge is true, when applied to people on low incomes, it is untrue. That is one reason why I believe that the principle that has been established should be continued as long as the community charge is in being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee for the fact that, with all the interruptions, this has been such a long speech, but is has been an interesting one in which I have dealt with all the points put to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having withdrawn my name from amendment No. 249,1 had not intended to speak to it until last night I heard the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) criticise, with some rancour and bitterness, my espousing the cause of high-quality social services in Devon. In addition, I believe that I owe it to the Committee, particularly my hon. Friend the Minister, to explain briefly why I did not move the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for me to go into the arguments because my hon. Friend the Minister has dealt with those eloquently and effectively. I would expect no less and we have been served an excellent meal of understanding and high competence in disentangling the often intellectually unsound reasoning and financially badly based arguments advanced by the Opposition. Those have now been made null and void.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not criticise the hon. Member for Brightside in his unavoidable absence. However, I wish to point out that I am absolutely correct in saying that the social services in Devon are excellent. The Conservative chairman, councillor Sylvia Russell, and the staff members, particularly in the Torridge part of my constituency—Ian Rice, Rev. Ray Voaden and their staff—work extremely hard and well in respect of mental handicap, care in the community and the all-important, enormous task of special care for the elderly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. When you called amendment No. 249 last night, it was not moved. The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson), who tabled the amendment, said mat she would not move it. Is it right to debate an amendment that has not been moved because the hon. Lady did not have the courage to move it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West is speaking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
to amendment No. 250. That amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). The hon. Lady is in order, but the vigilance of the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) may catch her even yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am under my Whip's instructions to be brief, and I shall be. It is clear that the Labour party cannot make any criticisms. Labour Members bounce up and down like yo-yos to try to deflect me, which is disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devon social services, the health authority and the local authority under Richard Brasington are working hard on the difficult task of running multi-disciplinary teams and on interdepartmental work. That is laudable. What a contrast that is with the Labour ideologues who run councils in Camden, Lambeth and, I expect, in Sheffield, Brightside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) made the usual wild Labour statement. He said that people outside are writhing. in anger at the Government's failure to accept the amendment. I withdrew my amendment because the citizens advice bureaux service, which genuinely represents poor and disadvantaged people—unlike the hon. Member for Dagenham—agreed that I should say that it is delighted with the announcement last week by my hon. Friend the Minister and that it no longer sees any purpose in the amendment. As I tabled the amendment on behalf of the service I wish to put that on the record. The hon. Member for Dagenham may be writhing in anger but it is because he has failed to win the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I rose to my feet because the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. However, the words are on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you said that that was not a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. It was an entirely spurious attempt to deflect my reasoning, but it will not work because Conservative reasoning is straightforward and accurate. I can tell the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) that all the Labour post must have been late because I received a letter from the NACAB yesterday evening and I also discussed the letter with it. The NACAB expressed its satisfaction with the announcement made by my hon. Friend the Minister, and the amendment therefore has no purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I heard the words "misleading the Committee" uttered sotto voice. I remind members of the Committee that it is not parliamentary, wise, prudent or right to accuse another Member of misleading the Committee. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of misleading the Committee—that would be wholly improper.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As I understand it, it was not the hon. Lady. But I did hear, from the Opposition side of the Committee, words suggesting that the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) was misleading the Committee. That is not a permissible or reasonable accusation. The hon. Member who made such a statement can correct it by making the same point in different language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to see the letter, misleading or not, and I challenge the Opposition to produce it. I do not accept such criticisms without substantiation.

As you, Mr. Leadbitter, have ruled that point of order out of order, and have declared that the word "misleading" does not exist— </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Member concerned is about to say a few words to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting that the hon. Lady was in danger of misleading the Committee. That suspicion was reinforced when she made it clear that she would rely on her research assistant, especially in view of the track record of Conservative Back Benchers' research assistants. I shall withdraw the remark, as I did not want to imply that she was trying to mislead the Committee. However, I shall stick to my contention that she is in danger of doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In accordance with the principle of "garbage in, garbage out", Opposition Members have failed to make their misleading calculations stick in the face of my hon. Friend the Minister's accurate statements. I remind the Committee that one gets the answer to the question that one asks, as was proved by Mr. Gallup the other day in discovering that 76 per cent of all American citizens believe that topless bathing on the beach should be banned—for men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was impressed and moved by the hon.

I look forward to hearing her support the service when we come to the next amendment, which deals with the abolition of the 20 per cent, contribution rule. I hope that the hon. Lady will prove her great reliance on that organisation by voting in support of the amendment, which enjoys the strong support of the service.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Lady's researcher is still in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's speech may have broken the record for length if not for enlightenment. Nevertheless— perhaps inadvertently—the Minister cast some light on what is going on in the Government's mind and on why they consistently get these matters wrong. In some respects, what the Minister revealed was not surprising, because it showed a heartlessness and lack of concern for fairness and because his position was clearly based exclusively on some academic calculation that bore no relationship to reality, but it was surprising in that it showed the complete intellectual bankruptcy of his position, which meant that whenever he was challenged to produce any justification for the calculation underlying the taper, he simply asserted that that was the course that the Government had chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reminded me of an earlier debate when we discovered to our amazement that the Minister's famed logic had let him down and, having agreed that a person suffering from Alzheimer's disease shold be relieved of the obligation to pay his 25 per cent personal element of the council tax, he said that that person should nevertheless be jointly and severally responsible for the 25 per cent contribution of someone else as well as for 50 per cent of the property tax. That was a similar instance of heartlessness and illogicality combined to produce a totally unjustifiable outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
We have the same situation here. The Minister certainly cannot pretend that his policy prescriptions are fair and he cannot justify them with any understandable argument. He is clear that his calculation has nothing to do with interest rates: I am prepared to accept that. Who are we to say that it is based on interest rates? But if it is not based on interest rates, what is it based on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interest rates figure in the debate solely because they present themselves as one obvious measure— the usually applied measure—for trying to calculate income from capital. If that is done by way of a hypothetical calculation, that is an obvious point of reference. But if the Minister asserts that interest rates have nothing to do with it, we are entitled to ask the basis of the calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister simply says that he picked two figures arbitrarily, £3,000 at one end of the scale and £16,000 at the other—incidentally, it was pressure from Opposition Members and other quarters that led to the doubling of the figure from £8,000 to £16,000—and if his argument that the £250 step producing £1 a week income is the way that one gets from the £3,000 end of the scale to the £16,000 end of the scale, that is no explanation at all. It does not tell us why he has picked those figures and why the scale operates in that fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Janman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman implying that if the Labour party were given the opportunity it would change the rules that apply to the taper? If so, how would those rules be changed? Would such changes mean yet another implicit pledge by his party to increase public spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition's obligation is to oppose. That is what we did when these measures were introduced. What we are now entitled to have from the Minister is an explanation on how his rules are calculated, how they are justified, and how he can explain the basis of those rules to those who are penalised by them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a telling statement. First, he asserts that the Opposition's job is to oppose. That has been evident for the past 12 years. That is all Labour Members have done. There has not been a single constructive suggestion from the Opposition Benches in all that time. It is not only the job of the Opposition to oppose; it is the job of the Opposition to represent opinions outside the House and to propose an alternative way of action. The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on the failure of his party over the past 12 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are approaching a general election. If the Labour party is offering itself only as a party of opposition, the hon. Gentleman's remarks are justified. If Labour Members aspire to be an Opposition party, there is no need for them to explain what they would do. I had understood—I must have got it wrong—that they were offering themselves as an alternative Government. If so, they must offer a set of policies, state what they would spend, what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>939</span>
they would do precisely and how they would defend their policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has shown up their failure over the past 12 years and the fact that the Labour party does not believe that it is up to being an alternative Government. The Labour party is offering itself only as a party of opposition and it will be in that position in perpetuity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister attempts, at this late stage, to widen the issues. As the next Government, we are certainly not remiss in offering to the people of this country an explanation of precisely what our proposals are for local government finance. Some 17 months ago, we published our fair rates proposals, which have been open to public debate and scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals remain the preference of the majority of people in this country far and above—I apologise to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti)—local income tax and, certainly, far and above the poll tax and the council tax. There is no doubt in the minds of the British people that when they elect a Labour Government, they will get a fairer and more practical system of local government taxation and they will vote for a Labour Government on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. I do not want to fall into the trap into which the Minister fell.

The hon. Gentleman is a member of that Committee, too, because of the lack of Tory Members in Scotland. There was a Division in Committee at the same time as the Division in this one.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I wish to raise a serious and significant matter, which refers to our deliberations at about 9.45 pm on Tuesday 3 December, as recorded in column 753 of part II of 	<i>Hansard.</i> We were discussing SSAs, and I referred to the West Yorkshire police authority. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister will recall the representations that were made by more than one group of people last year about the cap on the West Yorkshire police authority. Even the chief constable said that the level of expenditure was insufficient to meet the demand on police services."—[	<i>Official Report</i> Standing Committee A, 3 December 1991; c. 753.]</p></blockquote>
In reply, the Minister said, "You cannot believe everything that councillors, officers and chief constables say." We drew attention to that remark. The Minister's comment is not in 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That statement was made, and the Minister obviously remembers it because he has asked where it is recorded. I have looked through the entire 	<i>Hansard</i> to see what the Minister said, but it is not recorded.

I ask for clarification, Mr. Leadbitter. I understand the problems involved in producing 	<i>Hansard.</i> The 	<i>Hansard</i> reports of Tuesday night's sittings were only available this moning to members of the Committee.

The 	<i>Hansard</i> in question is for the period until midnight. I left the Committee just after midnight, so I do not think that the Minister's comment could have been recorded in any other 	<i>Hansard.</i> I understand the amount of work that 	<i>Hansard</i> staff have had to do on the Committee, and there could have been some oversight. But the Minister's answer to my question should be on the record. Will you investigate, Mr. Leadbitter, to find out why his response is not in 	<i>Hansard?</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman has been considering the matter while the hon. Member has been speaking and recalls those matters. I must add a caveat—I do not remember what happened word for word. The theme of the contribution of the hon. Member for Normanton is well in mind, and I must stress that a meticulous record will have been kept as he spoke and as the reply was given of the matters

	<span class='label label-info column'>941</span>
outlined in column 753 of 	<i>Hansard.</i> The position is clear. This is Committee business, and I suggest that the 	<i>Hansard</i> of that time should be examined and the Committee informed of the position. In addition, the hon. Member for Normanton and any other member of the Committee can approach the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff privately and make their own inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Your suggestion is valuable and correct, but I want to amplify a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), which you supported and which I also support. Most members of the Committee recollect such a remark about local authority associations and chief constables, but I suspect that none of us can remember precisely when it was made. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend is right to suggest that it must have been made between the point recorded in column 753 and his departure from the Committee at midnight. When 	<i>Hansard</i> is checked, perhaps an examination could be made of the Minister's comments over the entire period because he may have made the remark later, rather than as a direct response to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I should expect 	<i>Hansard</i> to take note of and record the words that have been spoken here, in response to the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Normanton, so that there is no mistake about the examination of 	<i>Hansard,</i> the intentions of the Committee, the words used in the point of order and the Chairman's advice. I hope that the outcome will satisfy the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 329, in page 68, line 6, at end insert—

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday was an historic occasion for Parliament when we reached the stage of agreeing to abolish the poll tax. That decision will be welcomed by many people, particularly by Mr. Charles Scott, a councillor in north Yorkshire who resigned from the Tory party last year because of the poll tax. The Minister said that the Opposition had done nothing about the matter, but we argued against the poll tax becoming law before the Bill was actually
	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
on the statute book. It took 12 months of hardship and a cost of £14.5 billion for the Government to take this decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the abolition of the poll tax, we must now consider other matters, such as clause 101 and the seven pages of schedule 9. We must deal with the abolition of the 20 per cent payment by people on low incomes. Everyone, no matter how low his income, must pay at least 20 per cent poll tax. The Government have conceded the principle and accepted that people on low incomes will qualify for 100 per cent council tax rebate from April 1993, but we should now consider bringing that date forward to April 1992. The Opposition would work with the Government to ensure that the 20 per cent payment was abolished by then, if the Government have the will and determination and the sympathy for people on low incomes to do that. People who pay the minimum 20 per cent contribution—I repeat what many people and organisations have already said—have difficulty paying that and their other bills. Last night, I referred to the problems experienced by many people who are on income support in paying their energy costs. Usually, people give higher priority to keeping warm than to paying their poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) referred to his speech of last night. That reminded me that the Committee has already spent two hours last night and 1 hour and 50 minutes today discussing that subject. Will you give the Committee some of your wise guidance, Mr. Leadbitter, on the subject of repetition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for the Chairman to detect repetition when amendments are taken separately. Certainly, repetition is inevitable whenever the Committee considers a part of the Bill which refers to an assessment of council tax or an amendment which would produce a reduction in council tax, or any other calculations which refer to council tax—that covers a wide range of matters in chapter V of the Bill.—The Chairman rules on repetition only if it becomes boring. At this stage, the Chairman is happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) not wanting me to pursue the question of the 20 per cent rule because it causes the Government much embarrassment. However, today is the last day of the Committee stage of the Bill and I think that it is rich for the hon. Gentleman to rise on a point of order during my speech when we have heard so much repetition from Conservative Members. I was talking about something that is really significant to people who find it difficult to pay the 20 per cent contribution. The hon. Gentleman raised that point of order in an attempt to suppress the points that the Opposition want to make on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, yesterday, I referred to energy costs it was in reply to an intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). The 20 per cent contribution causes real hardship to some people, particularly those on income support and low
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
incomes. During previous sittings of the Committee and in the House, hon. Members have said that local authorities face the crazy situation of having to collect money and having to pay to collect that money. It makes economic sense to abolish the 20 per cent contribution, save money for the local authority and ease the situation of people on income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the consultation paper "A New Tax for Local Government", which was published by the Department of the Environment, many people and organisations called for the immediate abolition of the 20 per cent contribution. That included people who were not connected with the Labour party and professional organisations, such as the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the briefings submitted by the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation. That organisation tried to persuade the Secretary of State to abolish the 20 per cent payment. The AMA and the ADC—the latter is not Labour controlled—have also pressed the Government to abolish it. There is sufficient evidence for the Government to take note of what people are saying and abolish the 20 per cent payment completely from 1 April 1992 in the best interests of poll tax payers. The Audit Commission said that the 20 per cent payment should be abolished because it is costing more to collect than it is worth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that all hon. Members have difficulties at this stage of the proceedings. Taking each amendment separately is one thing, but one should avoid tedious repetition. If hon. Members are considering all the amendments and covering a wide range of questions related to the council tax, repetition becomes not only inevitable, but self-defeating. I recognise the difficulty of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), but he has covered those matters before. Perhaps he will bear in mind that we cannot have Second Reading debates on every amendment because in the context of the amendments on this part of the Bill, repetition will be inevitable. We must apply self-discipline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I take your point. In my previous incarnation, before I entered the House, I worked at a teacher training college. We talked not of repetition but of reinforcement. Perhaps you could view the matter in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rather odd, because I was a teacher too. The reinforcement that I had in those good old days lay in the back of the corner ready to be used. It was never used because it was there. I recognise the difficulty faced by the hon. Member for Normanton, but he will recollect that many of the same arguments have been advanced before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I am the son of a teacher. Perhaps I could highlight the fact that when I hear repeated the same quotation that I heard in a previous speech, it makes me wonder whether the teacher who is seeking to
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
teach from the Opposition Front Bench is also seeking to avoid discussion on other parts of the Bill, or perhaps he has nothing to say about the rest of the Bill. Could we move on to the next item?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I would call it anticipatory mischief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order Mr. Leadbitter. To ensure that I am able to concentrate fully on what the hon. Member for Normanton is saying, I wonder if the fans might be turned on again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Normanton has taken my comments on board. I want to emphasise that I recognise his difficulty. The hon. Member was not out of order on the amendment, but the subjects have been discussed for the past two days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to amendments Nos. 329 and 330. Let me read out the amendments so that there is no misunderstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I was challenged by a previous point of order for misleading the Committee when I said that the citizens advice bureaux service requested that I withdrew an amendment. The Opposition's challenge was then, I believe, only partially withdrawn. I felt a little hurt that my integrity had been impugned and that it was assumed that I would bring an organisation of such high calibre into any disrepute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has now been drawn to my attention that the letter to which the Opposition referred in support of the amendment from which I had withdrawn my name asked the Opposition to support amendment No. 329. May I therefore have a real apology?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the first point of order. I think that the hon. Member for Normanton was about to present an explanation. The hon. Member anticipates the Chairman correctly. He is not out of order on the amendment. However the Chairman suggests that the Committee has some forebearance with arguments that will inevitably arise from each amendment, as there is bound to be repetition. In recognition of that, the Chairman asks the hon. Member, for the sake of the Committee, to avoid using some of the original arguments and resist the temptation of a Second Reading debate. That would be helpful, but I know that it will be difficult for the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a previous point of order, the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am here, sir.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman in a good mood? I do not know whether he heard all that the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) said in connection with the words that he used. The Chairman recollects that when the hon. Gentleman was apparently accused of using words that suggested that the hon. Lady was misleading the Committee, he swore to correct the matter in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>945</span>
proper manner by saying that he thought that she was running a risk or danger of misleading the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has now referred to a letter, the purport of which I am not certain that the hon. Gentleman heard because he was coming into the Committee Room as it was mentioned. The hon. Lady has said that in view of the letter, she feels that there should be a proper withdrawal of the words "misleading the Committee". I do not know what the hon. Gentleman feels about that, bearing in mind that he made it quite clear that he would go no further than he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely correct, Mr. Leadbitter. I did not realise that the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West raised a point of order while I was out of the Committee Room, although over a cup of coffee she attempted to put my mind at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once I receive a copy of the letter showing that the error was on the part of the citizens advice bureaux service in not notifying members of the Committee that the amendment was to be withdrawn, I shall be prepared to accept that. I advised the hon. Lady of my attitude in the corridor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Since our excellent and friendly cup of coffee together—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which I paid for. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a Scottish economical Conservative and a woman, Mr. Leadbitter. What do you expect? After our excellent cup of coffee, sponsored by the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), I obtained further information which was that, alas, despite the hon. Gentleman's welcome statement now, the error lies with the Opposition, whom I believe may have failed in their haste to note to which amendment the letter referred. My point of order is that while my letter referred to amendment No. 249, from which I withdrew my name, the NACAB letter to which the Opposition referred pertained to amendment No. 250. Ergo, there is no correlation with my correspondence, and if I were in charge of briefing the Labour party, Labour Members would be far better briefed and would sing a very different tune.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. May we assume that the high regard exhibited by the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) for the citizens advice bureaux service and belief that that organisation speaks for the people means that she will vote for the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. That is purely a diversion from a serious matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Lady is asking that the words be withdrawn in view of the letter. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asking that the allegation be withdrawn because Opposition Members have misread their mail. There were two different items of mail attached to two different amendments. My letter was attached to amendment No. 249. Therefore, the statement made by the hon. Member for Makerfield has nothing to do with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Member for Makerfield heard what the hon. Lady has said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West protests too much. As I have already said, when I see a copy of the NACAB letter confirming that the hon. Lady was asked to withdraw her amendment, I shall accept it in good faith. I told the hon. Lady outside this Room that I would then make the appropriate remarks. Having got a free cup of coffee out of me, the hon. Lady should quit while she is ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I should be happy to accept that, although I am not sure that the hon. Member for Makerfield has grasped that the error lies with the Opposition. When that point has sunk in, it will be Scotch whisky on me to seal the deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right. Mr. O'Brien.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points of order which have been raised by Conservative Members are significant. They have used up a lot of time that could have been spent on the amendment. That shows all too clearly the views of Conservative Members about the abolition of the 20 per cent contribution rule. The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) has made it clear that I would be letting down the citizens advice bureaux service and the Child Poverty Action Group if I did not refer to their letters and opinions in speaking to the amendments. Conservative Members accuse me of repetition, but the information supplied for these amendments was used in connection with others. Therefore, to put the record straight, let me say that I am using the brief that has come from organisations that are very important to his debate. I shall refer to the CPAG in my remarks, if that hurts Conservative Members, so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that I told the hon. Gentleman last week that it is right and proper for the Opposition to represent and articulate the views of individuals and organisations outside the House. I had a good meeting on Tuesday with the citizens advice bureaux and the National Consumer Council on some of these issues. I know that the hon. Gentleman is doing his best, as I am doing mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes it clear that we want the Bill to contain provision for 100 per cent liability so that from April 1992 no 20 per cent contribution will have to be paid. Those are the views that the citizens
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>947</span>
advice bureaux and the CPAG have put forward and they deserve our support. In its letter, the NACAB asks the Committee to support the 20 per cent payment from April 1992. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) asked the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West for her support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NACAB's briefing on the amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CAB Service supports this amendment which would entitle those on income support to receive a 100 per cent rebate from April 1992. The CAB Service welcomes the decision that people on income support will receive a 100 per cent rebate from April 1993."</p></blockquote>
That is fair. The CAB service is saying that if the Government can adopt the principle of the abolition of the 100 per cent rebate from 1 April 1993, what is stopping them from doing it from 1 April 1992?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister repeated his explanation of the taper. He said that it will be used to take people out of benefit. When my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham asked him for further information the Minister said that taking people out of benefit had nothing to do with capital. If that is so, to what does it apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being uncharacteristically absurd. How can I have said that it was nothing to do with capital? I said that it had nothing to do with interest rates, which is a completely different point. 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that in response to the same question asked repeatedly, I repeatedly gave the same answer. Of course taking people out of benefit has to do with capital, but not interest rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were referring to people's notional income. When the taper is applied and the poll tax payer applies for a rebate or benefit, the local authority writes to that person and explains that because of his income it is assumed that he will receive a certain amount of interest. That is taken into consideration when applying the taper. So if it has nothing to do with interest, I believe that some local authorities are under a misapprehension. That is because they tell people that they take into consideration the fact that they have £5,000 or £6,000 invested and assume that it will bring in a certain amount of interest. That interest is taken into consideration when calculating benefit. If the Minister is saying that that is not the way that local authorities should operate, he should give us further clarification. I assure the Minister that that is the way that some local authorities apply rebates on poll tax payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall spell it out again. If a person has £5,000 or £6,000 in savings, the £3,000 cut-off is applied. The person is then told that because his capital in total brings in a certain amount of interest, his benefit will be reduced accordingly. It is the interest that is used in the formula. If the Minister is saying that that is wrong, he should put it on the record so that I can take it up with the local authorities involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>948</span>
I return to the NACAB brief which asks our support for the amendments, and to an example from a CAB in Yorkshire, possibly in my constituency, although the name and address are not given. It is the case, which was referred to me, of a Yorkshire client of the CAB, a long-term sick person who received £52.10 income support and disability premium. From that income, fuel charges of £18.70 a week and £3.67 social fund are deducted. She is left with less than £30 a week to live on, from which she is expected to pay £2 community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CAB says that she will not pay her community charge, in the hope that the council can obtain a liability order and apply to the Department of Social Security for direct deductions. She feels that it would be better if her poll tax payment was deducted from her income before it reached her, because she is anxious that if she has the money she will pay for things other than the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote information provided by the House of Commons Library. On 21 March 1991, the Secretary of State, talking about the demise of the community charge said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… fairness … nobody likes paying taxes. But in our society taxes have to be basically acceptable to taxpayers and to achieve that they must be perceived to be fair."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 March 1991; Vol. 188; c. 404.]</p></blockquote>
The citizens advice bureaux service said that the payment of the 20 per cent tax is completely unfair. I accept that view and I hope that the Minister too will accept it, in the light of those comments by the Secretary of State during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 23 April, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"People on low incomes will receive rebates in addition to any discount to which they are entitled. There will be no minimum contribution to the council tax."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 April 1991; Vol. 189, c. 902.]</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State believes that that is right and he believes in the fairness principle, the measure should apply from 1 April 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the Child Poverty Action Group. I shall not quote its letter in detail as people have asked that the brief from the CPAG on 100 per cent rebates should be taken into account when we consider the amendments. The letter was presented to the Committee in full and I hope that hon. Members will agree that it should be handed to 	<i>Hansard</i> so that it can be printed in it. [Hon. Members: "No."] </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member cannot do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall quote from the letter. I was merely trying to short circuit the accusations made recently. The CPAG said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The government's consultation document on the council tax stated that 100 per cent rebates would be reintroduced; but that the government would have to consider an adjustment to benefit rates when the council tax was introduced, because of the 'compensation' element given in means-tested benefits in April 1988 and April 1989 when claimants had to meet 20 per cent of their domestic … community charge.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>CPAG is very pleased that on 28 November the government announced that there would after all be no 'clawback'"—</p></blockquote>
that is the document to which I refer—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>949</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the compensation element when the council tax is introduced This means that the government has accepted both principles … that there should be no minimum contribution to local government taxation … that there should be no clawback of any compensation element by reducing benefit levels… There is therefore a very strong case for putting both these principles into practice as soon as possible, under the community charge."</p></blockquote>
That is where the case rests. The principles that have been established should be considered by the Minister. The CPAG, with the support of the citizens advice bureaux, asks that those principles be accepted and the 20 per cent contribution abolished by 1 April 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that we have other matters to discuss. I am sure that Conservative Members accept the principle behind the CPAG letter. I have moved the amendment in the name of Opposition Members and Conservative Members who have expressed support for the views of the citizens advice bureaux and the CPAG.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman joking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be damaging if it stood on the record that, because the hon. Gentleman mentioned nurses, I was sighing. I made no gesture at all. I simply fixed the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is more accurate to say that we have a love-hate relationship. The Minister loves to hate me every time I make a contribution. I withdraw the allegation that he was sighing. I do not want to get into trouble again.

In a debate on 20 November, I had a ding-dong with the Under-Secretary of State for Wales about the way in which the Government calculated the community charge. Students on Project 2000 training courses paid a 20 per cent contribution while the 55,000 student nurses on training courses run by district health authorities had to make a 100 per cent contribution. Under the new arrangements, that serious anomaly will continue. Project 2000 nurses will receive a 100 per cent remission and other student nurses will have to pay the full amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate, I asked the Under-Secretary a specific question. He asserted that the 55,000 student nurses could rely on the benefit system for help with their contributions. I asked:
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"how many of the 55,000 trainee nurses affected by the poll tax receive relief? If the Minister says that there is no difference, what is the position? Can he give us the figures?"</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary jumped to his feet to say, "I have no idea." That is the first and only time that he has admitted to knowing nothing about a subject. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman will have to table a question to Ministers in the Department of Social Security to obtain that information."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 20 November 1991; c, 176.]</p></blockquote>
I went on to say that, with all due respect, he should have the figures available when making such an assertion. With all the civil servants to help him, he should be able to provide such information. Unfortunately, he replied that he was not prepared to seek out the information and that he would leave me to my own devices. I have great pleasure in announcing that I have taken him up on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submitted written questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security. The first was the same one that I asked of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales—which is reported in column 176 of the Committee proceedings of 20 November—about the social security benefits that are potentially available to single nursing students. The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security gave the same answer that it was open to nursing students to
	<br><blockquote><p>"have access to the normal range of social security benefits, provided the appropriate qualifying conditions are met"—</p></blockquote>
So, that is 1:0 to the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. My next question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what minimum level of community charge would be required for a nursing student to be able to claim community charge benefit in the current financial year, assuming that 	<i>(a)</i> the student is aged under 25 years, single, is not pursuing a Project 2000 course of nursing and has a net weekly income of £96.83 and"—</p></blockquote>
the figure that we all agree is the current rate for the job for trainees—
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>(b)</i> the student is aged over 25 years, single, is not pursuing a Project 2000 course of nursing and has a net weekly income of £96.83."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) The personal community charge would need to be nearly £595 or higher before any community charge benefit would be payable."</p></blockquote>
That refers to students under the age of 25. No wonder that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales could not answer; that is 1:1. The reply of the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security continued, referring to students over 25:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) The personal community charge would need to be about £511 or higher before any community charge benefit would be payable."</p></blockquote>
That is 2:1 to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was 1:0 before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary should hang on a moment. When I asked him on 20 November in Committee how many nurses would qualify, he said that he could not have that information. My comment that the Government did not have the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
information because, given the current levels of income relating to qualification for benefit, all the 55,000 nurses would be outside the qualification basis by at least £12 to £14 was met by howls of anger from the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked that same question of the Secretary of State for Social Security. It was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many nursing students claimed community charge benefit in 1990–91."</p></blockquote>
The answer was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The information requested is not available"</p></blockquote>
That is a nice way of saying that not only do the Government not know, but nurses have been unable to claim. If claims had been made, the information would have been available. Therefore, the assertion of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales in Committee on 20 November that 55,000 student nurses would qualify for claiming benefit is erroneous. The students are being cast aside and will have to continue to make contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of my written questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people with a net weekly income of £96.83 claimed community charge benefit in 1990–91."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, I gave the Government a second chance. I left nurses out of the calculation. I asked how many of the potential 8 million income support claimants in the United Kingdom on incomes of £96.83 would have qualified. The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security gave the written answer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is estimated that about 25,000 claimants with a net income of between £96 and £97 were in receipt of community charge benefit in May 1990."</p></blockquote>
What is that in proportion to income support claimants? How many of that number were student nurses? The source of information was given as
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Housing Benefit/Community Charge Benefit Management Information System annual 1 per cent, sample inquiry for May 1990. However, data for May 1990 underestimates the number of recipients of Community Charge Benefit because some people who were entitled to benefit had not had their benefit claims assessed by then.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>Note:</i></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The figures exclude those in receipt of Income Support and in cases involving couples, the income specified is for the couple and not an individual person."</p></blockquote>
Couples on an income of just above £97 per week are not entitled to income support. Student nurses earning £96 83 per week would not be able to claim for community charge benefit, but the Minister asserted that they could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that debate, I made the point that the Government would probably phase out training schemes in district health authorities to coincide with the introduction of the council tax and that the Government could introduce tapering. They could work out with the Department of Health a date when student nurses would be employed only through Project 2000. We could set up a negative arrangement whereby, between now and when Project 2000 becomes the sole vehicle for training national health service nurses, the 55,000 who would move out of the system would be treated no differently from the Project 2000 nurses. Therefore, I asked the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>
of Health about the timescale of the introduction of Project 2000. My question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Health when he expects all nursing students to be within the Project 2000 scheme in England."</p></blockquote>
On 28 November, I received the reply:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Implementation of Project 2000 began in 1989. By the end of the current financial year, nearly 60 per cent of the colleges and schools of nursing in England will have received approval to run Project 2000 and £109 million will have been made available centrally towards the cost of implementation. Our aim is to complete implementation as soon as possible".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 November 1991; Vol. 199, c.	<i>594–98.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the Minister for Health confirmed my assertion that it is likely that within the time that it will take to introduce the provisions of the Bill, if it becomes an Act, nurses will already be in Project 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the short time between April 1992 and April 1993, although it may last slightly longer. We ask the Department to introduce regulations in such a way that the 55,000 student nurses employed by the NHS are not treated differently from the 7,500 student nurses on Project 2000. It is monstrously unfair that a small set of student nurses are given 100 per cent redemption under the council tax, but because 55,000 student nurses have been redesignated by the Government as employees, they are excluded from the benefit. That is inequitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to raise the problem of the student nurses employed by the NHS. Because they are not Project 2000 nurses, the Government are charging them the full council tax. Is he aware that next to my constituency there is a crucial marginal seat held by a Conservative Member? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My seat is not marginal; I plan to hold it quite comfortably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intervening myself, so I cannot give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an interview with his local paper on 22 November 1991, the Conservative Member of Parliament for that seat said that he is in favour of student nurses being exempted altogether from the council tax and that is not clear how student nurses will be treated. That is the view of the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Summerson). Do not Conservative candidates and Members of Parliament say one thing in their constituency while the Government do exactly the opposite?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because I shall now reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen). The hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) can beg all he likes; I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is being a little harsh on the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Summerson). The only thing that the hon. Gentleman has done is to whip out the Conservative central office briefing notes—we have just received a copy—which tell prospective candidates, party members and council
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>953</span>
leaders that, if they are asked about student nurses, they should tell the public that student nurses are exempt. The Conservative party does not say what kind of student nurses it means. It does not want to say that only Project 2000 student nurses are exempt. The Conservative party is misleading its own members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) for acting as my private parliamentary secretary this morning. On page 3 of "The Council Tax—A Guide For Party Workers", printed and published by the local government department of Conservative central office, the fifth paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Students, student nurses, apprentices and YT trainees will automatically be entitled to personal discounts."</p></blockquote>
There was no mention of Project 2000. There was no mention of the fact that 55,000 of the 62,500 student nurses in the United Kingdom are not exempt and will have to continue to pay the full council tax. That is how the Conservative party is misleading the public and attempting to mislead its council candidates and Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I promised that I would give way to the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I promised the hon. Member for Thurrock.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I had hoped not to cut across the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) so I asked him to give way, but I wanted to raise a point of order before the end of the sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is the last sitting of the Committee that you are chairing, Mr. Leadbitter. I should like to say how very much we have valued the way in which you have occupied the Chair. The good humour with which the Committee has been conducted has been a tremendous feature of it and you have contributed enormously to that, Mr. Leadbitter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether this will be the last Committee that you chair as a Member—I hope that you will chair another one. If this is your last Committee, Mr. Leadbitter, may I say that I hope that you will take from it the very happy memories that we have shared and the thorough appreciation of all members of the Committee of the way in which you have conducted yourself in the Chair. Your light touches have helped us, in these very difficult circumstances of sitting three days a week, to enjoy ourselves and to conduct the debate and explore the issues to the fullest extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>954</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I wish to associate Labour Members— the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) may wish to say a word of his own—with the Minister's remarks and add our gratitude to you for your excellent job in guiding us through this very difficult Committee. Your good humour, as the Minister said, has been a great advantage in helping to lighten some of the more difficult moments. Parting is always such sweet sorrow, as they say, and I am sure that our regret at losing you will be matched only by your regret at having to leave us to soldier on for the remaining sitting. I am sure that as you enjoy a well-earned rest this evening you will have a thought for us as we complete this arduous journey through Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two sides of the Committee differ slightly as to how desirable it might be for this to be your last Committee—although Labour Members do not wish to lose you, we hope that this will be the last piece of legislation that we have to endure from the present Government. If this is your last Committee, it brings to a conclusion a very distinguished period of service in the Chair. There will be many hon. Members, not just in this Committee but throughout the House, who will wish to add their thanks and congratulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I, too, wish to add my thanks to you on behalf of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) for your kindly and courteous chairing of the Committee sittings. I have served on Committees which you have chaired and have always been struck by your sense of humour, which I think must be a great asset for a Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a new Member, I have always been grateful for the kindness which you have shown to me and, I am sure, to every other member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Committee for all those kind words. They are very much appreciated. It is really good fun being a Committee Chairman. One hears all sides and begins to work out something to say to get on the record so that people know that one has been here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a remarkable experience and a great honour to be a Member of Parliament. Whenever I walk through the Palace Yard gates, I am mindful that I represent some 70,000 people. Those of us who work hard in Committees, and all our friends who visit us to see the real Parliament at work—it is very different from its portrayal in the newspapers—have a common interest in the value of this institution. I am proud that I have been able to work here for almost 28 years. I am still very young, and still virile too, but no Chairman can do anything at all without help from the Committee and especially from the Public Bills Office and other officials. The same goes for the Government officials, the security people, the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff—everybody plays an equal part in making a Committee work.
