PERSONS LIABLE TO PAY COUNCIL TAX</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day],</i> No. 122, in page 5, line 10, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Subsection (3) above shall not apply to any person who on any day is a person to be disregarded under paragraph (1), (2) or (4), of Schedule 1.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing amendment No. 124, in clause 9, page 6, line 30, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Subsection (1) above shall not apply to any person who on any day is a person to be disregarded under paragraph (1), (2) or (4) of Schedule 1.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: At 1 pm I was on my feet expressing anxiety about the procedures involved in joint and several liability. I was making a point about public utilities, to which I shall return. First, to put the discussion about the amendments in context I should like to read a press cutting from a local newspaper that I retrieved from the Library in the interval. Under the heading "Husband Jailed for Wife's Poll Tax Protest", the article states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An unemployed business executive"—</p></blockquote>
there are a lot of them around these days—
<br><blockquote><p>"yesterday became the first man in Britain to be jailed for not paying his wife's poll tax."</p></blockquote>
The article describes how John Rushton, aged 60, agreed to pay up on his own behalf, but was refused permission to meet his wife's contribution. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Rushton, a former sales and marketing manager of Fen Drayton, Cambridgeshire, had paid his own £330 community charge, but Mrs. Rushton objects to the tax and threatened to leave her husband if, as head of the household, he paid for her.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The magistrates at Cambridge jailed him for 14 days."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Rushton was eventually released when his friends clubbed together and paid his wife's poll tax.<br><br>
The debate is about what can happen, and the circumstances of that case illustrate clearly what can happen to innocent victims who are caught up in this legal minefield. What was meant originally to be a personal tax became a family tax. As a result people who pay their own poll tax bills find themselves criminalised and put in gaol because of a protest made by their spouse.<br><br>
That case was typical of those that provoked the Child Poverty Action Group to issue in June this year a document that deals with the Government's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
proposals for the council tax. The document makes some general comments, but is really directed at the proposals for accountability and enforcement. The organisation was worried enough to issue a statement, and it will be worthwhile to make it clear to the Committee what the Child Poverty Action Group said about the provisions. The CPAG is one of several organisations that is recognised by the Government as a group which represents people on low incomes, people who have problems under the benefit system and those who need general advice. It also issues guidance to people on how to reach a satisfactory settlement to get themselves out of debt.<br><br>
In addition, the CPAG campaigns on the effects of the Government's policies on the poor in Britain. When introducing proposals that can affect the daily lives of those on poor incomes, it is important that the CPAG's views are taken into account. Fran Bennett, a representative of the organisation, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"we are concerned that at one stage the Secretary of State for the Environment appeared to be considering transferring 'joint and several liability' from the poll tax to the council tax. The use of the term 'liable adult', and the occasional implication that discounts are personal to the relevant individual rather than applying to the head of household, lend some weight to this concern."</p></blockquote>
In June this year, the Child Poverty Action Group was already voicing its major worry about the Government even considering transferring that provision from the poll tax legislation to the council tax proposals. Fran Bennett continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Joint and several liability currently applies under the poll tax to married and cohabiting couples. As the council tax is a household based tax, it would apply beyond the benefit unit of the couple to other household members. The practical difficulties of operating such a rule—especially if combined with annual (rather than weekly or monthly) liability—would be enormous. And the unit for rebate purposes (the couple) would be different from the unit for joint and several liability (the household). We would urge the Government not to extend joint and several liability, and hope that it is not being seriously considered as an option."</p></blockquote>
That recommendation was actually underlined by the Child Poverty Action Group. Yet six months later, not only has that advice been ignored, but the group's fear has been realised and the provision has been transferred to the Bill.<br><br>
We see all around us the advice that was given to the Government. It was that they should learn a lesson from the implementation of the poll tax. The Bill should not be about the transfer of huge parts of former legislation into the council tax proposals. The Government should have listened to administrators of the poll tax and represenatives of those who have been affected by it. Both groups of people advised that the measure should not be in the legislation.<br><br>
In October, the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation held a seminar to consider the way in which poll tax debts had created a legal and administrative minefield for local government officials who operated the collection arrangements. The seminar did not concentrate only on how the problem of debt collections had arisen. It sought the most effective ways to achieve recovery. It wanted to ensure that the recovery arrangements took into account the civil liberties of those concerned and their circumstances in respect of debts accrued because of the poll tax legislation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
The report of the seminar contained a section that dealt precisely with the problems of joint and several liability. Therefore, as late as last month, professional organisations flagged up the severe difficulties that the poll tax legislation was causing them, their members and individuals who were trapped in that legal mechanism. The report of the IRRV seminar states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Social security defined a couple. Questions that need to be asked included: Where are the partners residing? Do the couple share a household? What are the living arrangements? Is the relationship stable and how long has it existed?</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A married couple must be living together. A man and woman living together might not be living as husband and wife. Similar commonsense questions would be applied to separation."</p></blockquote>
So, right at the outset such intrusive, detailed questions had to be asked. They might not have been formally required by the Local Government Finance Act 1988, but the professionals say that in practice those questions had to be asked, in order to determine joint and several liabilities. The report continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Landlords, managers and co-owners may also be jointly and severally liable, but not brothers and sisters or individuals living separately in the same property.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Enforcing joint and several liability was difficult with many grey areas. How do you prove people are living together? … It is virtually impossible. If a husband and wife say they are living totally separate lives in one house, you can't prove it"—</p></blockquote>
That is true for the poll tax arrangements and will be for the council tax arrangements; it is a direct transfer.
<br><blockquote><p>"Searching for proof by other means could be successful. Names on the electoral register were unhelpful."</p></blockquote>
What does the Minister suggest: that we maintain, in some form, or other, officially or unofficially, the poll tax registration lists? Or, will we have, unofficially, to start preparing other forms of registration to ensure that local authority officers will be able to serve liability orders on someone in respect of his or her partner or alleged former partner?<br><br>
I could go on and on about issues that were raised at the seminar, but I think that it is clear from the increasing concern—clamour, even—of professional organisations that the proposals should be radically amended.<br><br>
I want to ask the Minister a question on a matter that I raised unofficially with him before our proceedings began. We agreed that, because of the nature of the question, I would ask it officially. It is certainly an interesting matter that needs clarifying. I understand that, under the poll tax legislation, if someone under 18 were married or cohabiting and a partner over 18 left the relationship or the property, the younger person would not be liable to pay the poll tax, because it could not be levied on a minor. Would that apply under the council tax? In England, Scotland and Wales people can marry at 16, or—as is increasingly happening—cohabit at 16 and may be involved in a marriage or a partnership break-up. Will such 16-year-olds be protected against joint and several liability under the regulations? Normally, they would be protected, but there may be circumstances in which they are not. I think that Members of the Committee would like to know the circumstances in which 16-year-olds would become
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
liable for the tax, because the Bill clearly states that minors would not be liable to pay it.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I have a document from the Library that sets out advice on the collection of the community charge and explains what happens when someone gets married. It might be a hint to the Minister on where to look for the answer. The document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If you get married during a Community Charge year (e.g. April 1990–91)"—</p></blockquote>
that should be between April 1993–94 to be in line with the Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"only part of the Personal Community charge bill will be jointly and severally liable—that part after the marriage. The fraction of Community Charge for which joint and several liability arises is determined by the fraction</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A/B=fraction of chargeable amount for J & S liability".</p></blockquote>
That formula does not get us any further in respect of those in a partnership who are under the age of 18. Surely, it is not right that people under the age of 18 can be made legally responsible and face criminal proceedings for non-payment of a charge unpaid by a former partner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend spoke about someone under the age of 18 being liable for the tax under a joint and several liability, I have a constituent who was married the day after here 16th birthday to someone who is quite a lot older than her and who is obtaining benefit. He claims for her as a dependant because she, too, is unemployed, although that claim was initially refused. At least in theory, a contribution to the tax is included in everyone's benefit. Would her receipt of benefit qualify her to have the joint and several liability transferred because she had first received payment from social security via her husband? That would be a messy piece of law to sort out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an interesting point. It may throw up a drafting problem in relation to social security benefit regulations, which are drafted in such a way as to take account of income support levels, but not the age of the individual claiming the benefit. Thank God, I am not the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, nor the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security—yet. I shall pass the ball, as any good scrum half would, to the stand-off on the other side, for him to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just as well that we all watched the Rugby World cup, or we would not know what that meant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a supporter of rugby, I am saying nothing. I shall not let my hon. Friend draw me into talking about that.<br><br>
The issues that I have raised so far are not individual cases of an obscure nature, but issues of substance that have been raised by the Opposition
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
and, outside the House, by the organisations that in professional terms will be required either to operate the regulatons, to give advice and assistance on the operation of the regulations or, in instances where liability orders are issued, to act for and represent those against whom the orders have been issued.<br><br>
Those orders raise a question of civil liberty. When a relationship breaks down, often the female partner remains in the property. In most cases she is not in full-time employment, but in part-time, low-paid employment, and did not have responsibility for generating the partnership's income. It cannot be right for that partner to be made liable, out of the remaining income, for an account that was incurred during the time of that relationship, particularly as payment of the account is for the personal part of the council tax. It is for the poll tax part of the council tax, not the roof tax part. That has serious implications for those who are to be made liable, because failure to pay could result in the person being served with a summons, taken to court and criminalised. As in the Cambridgeshire case, magistrates can, if necessary, release the person from the liability by gaoling him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is another point. Where a couple is in receipt of benefit, the benefit is not paid to both partners individually. It is paid to one person, usually the husband or the person deemed to be the husband. The woman does not have control of that money—it is not given to her. If her partner leaves and has not paid the tax, she will be jointly and severally liable. It follows that men and women should receive individual payments of income support or invalidity benefit so that they have an individual income on which the tax can be levied. It is not unusual for social security legislation to discriminate against women, and the council tax reinforces that discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Under the regulations, income support and other benefits are paid directly to the male partner. If, prior to the relationship, the woman was receiving benefit, she has to give up her right to receive benefit independently. Until the relationship or the right to receive benefit ends, the income is firmly on one side of the partnership. She is not part of an overall strategy for the payment of accounts in the relationship. At the point when the breakdown occurs, however, she becomes legally liable for expenses not paid during the relationship. That does not apply only to the council tax; gas and electricity bills and water charges are also served on her. Under the council tax arrangements and the income support regulations, council tax and direct fuel debits can be deducted from the benefit that remains.<br><br>
A woman living on her own with a number of small children could receive miniscule amounts of benefit because payment of debts incurred during an earlier relationship have been deducted from the benefit at source, leaving that family with an income well below the level of income support, which is in itself the mean guide to poverty levels in the United Kingdom. It is not acceptable that someone living close to the basic level of support should be obliged by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
the legislation to meet the cost of a former partner's failure to fulfil his obligations during the relationship.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friends, I ask the Minister seriously to reconsider the principle of including these provisions in the Bill. If he will not give way on the principle, he should give a commitment to sit down with professional organisations, such as the Child Poverty Action Group, and consider ways of building safeguards into the legislation to ensure that the most vulnerable and the innocent in the community do not get trapped in a legal and financial minefield that could lead to them being criminalised or could reduce still further the low level of income on which they try to exist. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several of my colleagues have made withering attacks on the principle of joint and several liability, so I shall try not to repeat their remarks. They have made a detailed attack on its unfairness.<br><br>
I was taken by the opening remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He said that just a slight change in the circumstances of students—for example, a change of partner—could affect their liability. Students were described as invisible. If they are investigated, I will advise them to say, "Well, the Minister says that I am invisible, so you can't see me now."<br><br>
My hon. Friend was right when he cynically referred to aerial photography—the Minister is a high flyer, or thinks that he is, which is why he needs aerial photography.<br><br>
Joint and several liability is another element taken from the poll tax legislation and put into this Bill. In their haste to get rid of the poll tax and introduce the council tax, the Government have not thought through this matter, so all the problems associated with the poll tax will continue in the new tax. This morning the junior Minister said that this was not the poll tax or the rates. In that case, we do not have to base liability on the same criteria. We do not have to carry forward joint and several liability. The Government have not given themselves time to decide the best procedure.<br><br>
Joint and several liability is in many ways an iniquitous and unfair aspect of the Bill, as it was under the poll tax legislation. It leads to gender discrimination in a huge way. Under the Bill, everyone must pay his or her personal element or one partner must pay for both. In practice it is most often men who desert women, who are then left to pick up the pieces. That means picking up the bills that the men have left behind. That happens far more frequently than the other way around. Joint and several liability will add to the crisis faced by women in that situation because they will be burdened with the bills of their ex-husbands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recall the legislation which was completed in the House in spring this year, which set up legal mechanisms to ensure that the disappearing husband or male member of the household could be chased by the law
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0181">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
and made to pay his debts. The hon. Gentleman's points would certainly have been valid 12 months ago; they are not quite as valid now. I agree that the situation is not perfect.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the law has changed, but not enough to solve the problem. First, the husband has to be found and, secondly, a court order has to be obtained against him. I have known cases where the courts have awarded to women in those circumstances feeble sums which were not enough for her to pay the bills. The law has not changed enough and women are still not able to pay the bills of the partners who have left them.<br><br>
The second point about discrimination is that women have lower incomes than men. They have less money to pay their own bills, let alone those that they are saddled with from their partners. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) mentioned one piece of legislation with a bearing on this matter, but there was another which was introduced by the Right Hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He introduced individual taxation for women. Their liability was separate from that of their husbands. But the message has not got through to Ministers responsible for local government. They are not following an individual taxation regime in local goverment taxation but pursue joint and several liability. If the Government thought it right to introduce individual taxation at national level, why is it not right to apply it at local level?<br><br>
Women fear assault, especially when their husband or partner receives their bills. I raised with the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) the matter of housekeeping money, which has been a matter of dispute. A husband may claim that the housekeeping money includes money for all his wife's bills, including the poll tax, but the wife may not have enough to cover it. The arrears bill is then sent to her husband, perhaps leading to assault.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is probably so long since the old rating system that I have forgotten how it operated. If a spouse left home, was not the remaining spouse left, as they say, holding the baby? What happens to liability under the Labour Party's so-called fair rates?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That depends on the circumstances of the various cases. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall deal with that matter in my closing remarks.<br><br>
There is the danger of assaults on women as arrears build up. As I said in speeches on the poll tax, it is far better to have an irretrievable tax than to have a marriage or a woman's life suffer irretrievably. This is a case of gender discrimination in practice.<br><br>
Joint and several liability is unfair in terms of parliamentary principle. We set our face against retrospective legislation. I have heard Ministers say many times in Committee that it is inappropriate, yet to all intents and purposes this is a retrospective Bill. People will get a retrospective bill for tax which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
should have been paid by their partner. The bills sent out at the beginning of the financial year do not state, "By the way, you may have to pay your partner's bill."<br><br>
The rebates are not retrospective. A person might receive a much bigger rebate if the entire charge was laid upon him or her at the beginning of the year. As there is a time limit on claiming a rebate, people in those circumstances cannot claim one. They are therefore faced with a much larger bill, with nothing to mitigate its effects. That is unfair in principle.<br><br>
The bill continues the snoopers charter part of the poll tax legislation. Hon. Members already referred to the investigation of students' changing circumstances by council officials assessing liability. I shall not refer to students' love life, as we did last night. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred to the complications that arose.<br><br>
Will gay men and lesbian women be treated as living as man and wife for the purpose of joint and several liability? If so, how will that be proved? I can think of no way other than by snooping and by invading personal liberty on an enormous scale. Many elderly gay couples live privately and do not want their sexual relationship made known. Two people might live in the same place and that is different from living as man and wife. As man and wife, they have joint and several liability. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.<br><br>
This unfairness is to be extended to joint tenants, leaseholders, freeholders and other joint occupants, as well as to those living as man and wife.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham made a good point about the severely mentally impaired—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that one or two interesting conversations are being held, but the noise level is too high. Hon. Members who wish to listen are finding it difficult to do so. Perhaps we could have a whispering campaign—please whisper gently. The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) is also finding things hard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your protection, Mr. Leadbitter. I would whisper but then the <i>Hansard</i> reporter would not be able to hear me.<br><br>
It is unacceptable that a person who is severely mentally impaired should be saddled with somebody else's bill because they have lived in the same house. The public would agree that that is unacceptable and that the severely mentally impaired should be exempted. If the Government do not remove the joint and several liability clause, the severely mentally impaired should at least be protected from its iniquitous effects.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Member for Nottingham, South, I shall conclude with a comment on a fairer system, the Bill will introduce a property poll tax. It would be fairer if each person were liable for his or her own half. The Government are introducing that system at national level, with individual taxation. Each person is liable individually and is not saddled with a partner's element of the bill. The Minister said

that this tax is not the poll tax or the rates, so we do not have to use the same criteria to establish liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I check whether the hon. Member agrees that benefit should be given to the penniless wife of a millionaire? That flows directly from his suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not my view. the simplest way round the problem is to get rid of joint and several liability and to return to the system which operated under the rates, whereby individual circumstances dictate liability. That should be the situation for the foreseeable future, as the Labour party recommends in "Fair Rates". However, in the long term, women need to be prevented from being saddled with unfair bills. However, I think that a millionaire's bill should be vastly higher in the first place. That it is not is the problem with the systems of local government taxation that the Government have proposed.<br><br>
The Government do not have to use the same criteria for the council tax as they did for the poll tax or the rates. I urge them not to do so because of the personal misery that that would cause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the Government to clarify their reason for retaining joint and several liability. Joint and several liability is a hang-over from the poll tax. It was a part of the recovery tactics for the poll tax for the Department of Environment, and it is also a part of the recovery system of the Department of Social Security for benefit. It was obvious from the outset that the Government would have problems collecting the poll tax. They passed the problem back to local authorities and the onus of poll tax collection was pushed on to households. It is an admission of the impossibility of collecting the council tax that the clause has been retained. Joint and several liability is always retrospective because people can become liable only for bills that have been due in the past. The provision often applies to people who had little or no income during the period covered by the bill. Had such jointly liable people realised that they would be responsible for bills during the period covered, they could have qualified for a rebate. Such people are penalised.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
There is a backdating system for social security rebates. There is a 56-day cut-off for housing benefit rebate. Local authorities have the discretion to back date rebates beyond that period, but are not reimbursed for such rebates. There is no time limit on the backdating of joint and several liability—it can go back years. The Minister should confirm that the reason for retaining joint and several liability is not to ensure that couples' liability for the council tax becomes a function of the social security benefit system. Can the Minister assure me that it will not be part of the benefit entitlement checking system? It must not be part of a surveillance system—ground, not aerial—passed on to the local authorities. If it were, local authority staff would have to reinforce the work of benefit staff who perform inspections to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
check on people's personal relationships to discover whether they are sharing meals, which is the current Department of Social Security definition of cohabitation. That will become a duty of local authority staff in respect of joint and several liability for the council tax. They will duplicate work presently done by the Department of Social Security.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend expertise on such matters, which I do not. The definition of cohabitees, who are jointly and severally liable, as people taking their meals together is extraordinary for this Bill or any other. Can my hon. Friend clarify that and tell us how that intrudes on people's lives, friendships and normal behaviour?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You may overrule me, Mr. Leadbitter, if I go into detail. People who share a household must prove that they have separate tables and cutlery, eat separately and do not live together. If is not whether they share a bed, but their internal household arrangments. Under such rules and checking procedures, people who are found to share meals, could be held jointly and severally liable under the clause, as they are under social security legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be exaggerating. To determine whether someone is living singly or in a partnership is complex. I have a case from my constituency that illustrates genuine difficulties. A young lady who is a single parent wrote to me saying that social services were taking an unconsciounable time to decide whether she was living alone or in a partnership. She wrote that her boyfriend was sleeping with her every night, but eating dinner with his mother. <i>[Laughter.]</i> No, I shall not respond to the peculiar laughter of Opposition Members, who do not take the woman's problem seriously. In the young lady's terms, she and her boyfriend were not living together. Her understanding of living together meant a complete life style together, and that included dinner. I assure those Opposition Members who laughed that the question of separate crockery did not arise, although that would have been crucial, had one of the partners been an orthodox Jew. It certainly forms no part of the investigation by the social services who were merely trying to ascertain who paid the bills.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that helpful intervention. For the record, I should point out that the raucous laughter seemed to come from the Conservative Benches. The Government Whip nearly fell out of the Committee, he laughed so heartily.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) has illustrated, most members of the Committee could give examples of people who are trapped because, for the purpose of paying benefit claims, social security cannot prove whether people are sleeping together. That is why the rules were changed. I am surprised that members of the Committee who were Members of Parliament when the Government changed the rules are not aware of that.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's perfectly reasonable example illustrates the absurdity of the rules. If the hon. Lady's constituent had a boyfriend who slept with his mother but ate with her, joint and several liability would apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend admirably demonstrates the absurdity of applying these rules in practice. Conservative Members may think that it is funny to analyse the rules, but I have constituents whose work is in jeopardy because of the way that they have been assessed for benefit. If I cited some of those cases, I am sure that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Leadbitter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make this second point? Incest is a serious problem within some families. It is not something to laugh about. It has been a serious problem in my constituency this week. A father had assaulted every one of his children and was turning to one less than 12 months old. It is an enormous, wretched problem. How can Opposition Members make vile jokes about it? The purpose of my raising the complex case about my constituent, whom I respect, was merely to point out how proper it is for social services—and in this instance for the council—to take special care when spending taxpayers' money. It need not be done insensitively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I hear Tory Members talk about such matters, there is always confusion. Social services are different from social security. I was talking about social security, which is provided through the tax system and has its own Department, whereas social services tend to be concerned with the care of the elderly and are covered by local authorities. Local authorities are not responsible for the benefit system.<br><br>
The debate is interesting in that we are now discussing the social security system. I imagine that you have not ruled us out of order, Mr. Leadbitter, because the clause steers local authorities towards doing the job of the Department of Social Security. I hope that it is not the intention of the Department of the Environment to tell local authorities that they must do the dirty work. It will affect social services because the money will come out of the social services budget. Social service staff will have to snoop and check on personal relationships and the money for that will come from local authorities. That loss of resources could be avoided.<br><br>
I hope that the Minsiter can confirm that it is not the job of a Bill put forward by the Secretary of State for the Environment to do the dirty business of the Department of Social Security. There is no other rationale for the clause. I hope that the Minister will withdraw the provisions for joint and several liability. Such provisions are a hangover from the poll tax. They would have the effect of carrying out the checking that is currently done by the benefits system. That has nothing to do with collecting the council tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the beginning of the debate the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred to the question of residence. He put himself in a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
preposterous position when he suggested that legislation could not be formulated unless a precedent existed for defining the subject of the legislation. That would preclude much new legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I never, never speak for more than 30 seconds before the hon. Gentleman intervenes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's point was all the more preposterous because much work has been carried out to clarify the question of residence. The hon. Gentleman dismissed the Anderton judgment because it was only one case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I made a fleeting reference to the subject when I moved an amendment in an earlier debate. I cannot understand why the Minister believes it to be in order to develop an argument about a debate that ended some hours ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall listen a little further to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly relate my comments to our current debate. The way that residence has developed in case law, the treatment of beneficial occupation under rating law, and the view taken by the courts of joint and several liability are important factors.<br><br>
The Anderton judgment maintained that a merchant ship on the high seas could not, in law, constitute a residence. In the light of previous cases that dealt with residence, Mr. Anderton's residence was defined as a house in Bradford. That was his usual and settled abode, which he left only when the exigencies of his occupation compelled him to go to sea. The tribunal erred in considering only the time he spent in each place. Other factors that should have been considered included the fact that Mr. Anderton regarded the house as his home; that his wife and children presumably lived there; that he spent his time there when not on board ship and that he had an interest in security of tenure of the house.<br><br>
Previous cases provide valuable pointers to the true meaning of "sole or main residence", for example, re Young, Rogers v. Inland Revenue and ex parte Shah.<br><br>
During the debate, the hon. Member for Dagenham implied that the Government were misguided in attempting to define "residence" rather than "beneficial occupation".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I am trying to help the Minister. He is confusing an intervention that I made in an earlier debate, when I stressed the difficulty of providing further detail in the absence of any case law, with my opening remarks in the current debate. I said then that, just as the Government experienced difficulty in changing from the concept of occupation to that of residence, they experienced equal difficulty with joint and several liability, because of the nature and basis of the council

tax. Apart from that very fleeting reference, I did not mention the Anderton case or any case law. I mentioned none of the issues that the Minister is trying to introduce. I am absolutely perplexed by the Minister's intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what ails the hon. Gentleman. I did not feel the need to intervene once during his speech. The debate has been underway for about three hours, and I have been speaking for about 4 minutes, including interventions and points of order. I do not know why the hon. Gentlemen objects to my explaining my own case in my own way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister eventually connect it to the argument?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear that I will connect it to the argument.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham argued that residence was more difficult to define than beneficial occupation. I cannot accept that anyone believes that. Asking someone where he lives is a much simpler question than asking, "Where are you the beneficial occupier?" Under the rating system there was a series of cases about beneficial occupation. The treatment of husbands and wives was one of the issues that became increasingly complicated, and which arose in one case after another. The courts found that, in modern-day circumstances, it was no longer appropriate for husbands alone to be held liable for bills. In deciding the issue of beneficial occupation under rating law, husbands and wives were increasingly found to be jointly and severeally liable.<br><br>
I have tried not to be discourteous to the Opposition during our proceedings, and I do not understand why they have become so excited about my taking three minutes to explain that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not connect with the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does. Joint and several liability under rating law was often held by the courts to apply to husbands and wives. The hon. Member for Dagenham fairly pointed out that the rates bill was often shared out, and said that in certain instances the apportionment of the bill was logical. The council tax bears certain resemblances to the rates. One of the important ones is that there will be only one bill per household. The joint and several liability under the council tax corresponds more closely with the joint and several liability that was developing in case law under the rating system—when the courts dealt with the issue of liability under beneficial occupation—than it does with the community charge. Society has moved away from regarding the wife as chattel to the husband, and, as the courts found under rating law, it is no longer plausible to decide that all bills should be directed only to the male partner and that there should be no joint and several liability.<br><br>
Under the community charge, bills are individually addressed to different people. It was objected—though I did not agree with the objection—that joint and several liability might mean that one person
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
would be asked to pay when a different person was liable. Under the council tax, joint and several liability means that a couple is held jointly and severally liable for a liability that arises jointly and severally. That is because a household bill is sent to a household.<br><br>
The hon. Lady for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) was on extraordinary ground when she referred to the bills of married couples being run up by another person. In fact, they are run up by a couple jointly. If a couple decide to occupy a property together the tax falls upon them jointly. The hon. Lady and other hon. Members seem not to want to attach any significance to couples. I have no sympathy with that. If Labour Members were in Government, they would not be sympathetic to that. That they use such arguments simply shows that they have been out of Government for a very long time.<br><br>
We attach particular significance to couples—certainly, that applies in social security legislation. The concept was not invented by the Conservative party; couples have been treated differently from single people in social security legislation from the outset. Couples have decided to make their lives together and their needs are different from those of individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the change in tax law?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that.<br><br>
The tax law has been changed to a system of individual assessment. But, even under tax law, special significance attaches to the position of couples. Why else would we have transferable tax allowances, and special arrangements for married couples and married couples with children? Evidently, although there is greater equality in tax law, special significance is given to couples.<br><br>
I raise the point with the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) that one cannont seriously say that couples should be treated as two individuals. Indeed, the Labour party would be the first to protest if that were so—certainly, if it applied under social security legislation. It would mean that a person is entitled to benefit if he or she has no income although their partner is rich and on a high income. The Labour party would be the first to yell if that were proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Maria Fyfe: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may recall that the specific instances that I gave related to marriages and partnerships that had broken up. I mentioned the case of a marriage breaking up when one partner had been in gaol. Upon release, that person faced with his former partner's bills, although they are no longer a couple. Obviously, when a couple breaks up the partners become separate individuals. Why should women whose husbands have left them or whose marriage has ended by mutual agreement be jointly and severally responsible for their husbands's bills? The Minister has not understood our point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Lady is driving at. The purpose of joint and several liability is to equip local authorities with the most effective
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 305</span>
means to pursue an outstanding bill. If joint and several liability were not applied and women owned a property but depended upon her husband's income, she would have to be pursued for payment although she had no income. That would be absurd. I think that the Committee will support joint and several liability.<br><br>
Opposition Members who protested that such a liability will discriminate against women should realise that exactly the opposite will be true. It will mean that the man and the woman are equal within a partnership. Councils will pursue whomsoever of the two parties they consider is the more likely to have the means to pay the bill. Because it is not known—in modern society, it will not always be the man, and we do not want to intrude into the life of every couple to find out who has the dosh—joint and several liability should apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is indeed an absurdity to bill someone who has no income with which to pay, why was the poll tax introduced in the first place? Is not that what it did? To ensure that the poll tax operated, the Government had to introduce the concept that the Minister is defending. Without that concept there was no possibility of collecting the poll tax from millions of people with no income. He is publicly admitting that it was absurd to introduce legislation which taxed people with no income, yet that will continue under the council tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's colleague was so irate when I referred to a previous amendment that I had better not refer to a previous piece of legislation or I really will excite his ire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister centred the argument at the beginning of his speech around the Anderton case. He said that it established the principle of joint and several liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used it as an example of where joint and several liability was—[<i>Interruption.</i>] At the time, the Minister protested so strongly that it was relevant that I tried to listen. The hon. Gentleman said that the judge ruled that Mr. Anderton was liable to pay the poll tax because his wife lived on the premises. As she was presumably registered, they, as husband and wife, were jointly and severally liable, so it was decided that Mr. Anderton lived on the premises. Of course, the Anderton case was judged under the poll tax legislation which established the joint and several liability rule.<br><br>
The Minister gave some examples of what happened under the rates. Did the people who were judged jointly liable for the rates have a joint interest in the property? In property law, women have joint rights in a property. Under a property tax, as opposed to an individual tax, the argument might be advanced in slightly different ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Anderton judgment touched not on the question of joint and several liability, but on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
residence, which is germane to all of clause 6. The Anderton judgment did not say that Mr. Anderton was jointly and severally liable with his wife; it said that Mr. Anderton was liable to pay the community charge at his place of residence and it set out the criteria by which to judge the place of residence. As it happens, Mr. Anderton and his wife would thereafter be jointly and severally liable.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) said that the Anderton judgment was based on the community charge. It arose from the community charge but the definition of habitual residence is the same for both the community charge and the council tax. That is why it is relevant case law. It was not the community charge that first established the principle of joint and several liability. That arose in case law under the rates. I do not know whether, in all the cases under the rates in which people were held to be jointly and severally liable, they had an interest in the property. However, I do not believe that it would be desirable for us to try and find that out, because that is the sort of intrusion that the Labour party argues against.<br><br>
I should like to deal with other cases. The hon. Member for Maryhill and others raised the issue of prisoners. Because the clause is based on residence and because I am taking the trouble to spell out the criteria that are involved in residence, I think that the hon. Lady will spot fairly quickly that a prisoner cannot be held to be liable for the council tax in a place where he is not resident. That is clearly set out in the Bill. The hon. Lady spoke of someone returning from gaol to find a bill that had been run up by his wife but, in view of what I have just said, that seems not to apply. As the person would not be resident in the home, he and his wife would not be jointly and severally liable for the council tax bill that was incurred while he was resident elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If what the Minister says is correct, we must consider who is liable for rented premises. When a property is empty, the person responsible for the charge according to the legislation is not the resident but the owner. Yet the Minister has just said that the onus of paying the charge will be on the resident. That is not the whole picture because the Bill provides that, if premises are empty, the owner is responsible for two charges, less 25 per cent in each case. Will the Minister qualify what he said earlier and explain the Bill?</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A prisoner who continues to own a property can be liable for the council tax on it. If there are residents in the property they will be liable for the council tax. If the property is empty he will be liable. I cannot imagine why prisoners who own unoccupied property should be exempt from the tax. I do not know if that was what the hon. Gentleman was suggesting, but if it was, I disagree with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, someone who has just come out of prison will not be liable for his or her personal share of the poll tax or council tax, but will the Minister affirm that such a person will not be liable

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
for the council tax of his or her spouse or partner? The legislation on that is not clear. In fact, it is so unclear that the Local Government Information Unit, the AMA and others have asked that question, if it is not clear to local government officials it will certainly not be clear to the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear. In paragraph 6(2)(a), the Bill states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person falls within this subsection in relation to any chargeable dwelling and any day if, on that day—he is a resident of the dwelling"</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 6(2)(f) is the only provision in which residence is not relevant because it relates to the owner of a dwelling. "Owner" is defined in subsection 6(4). The legislation is clear.<br><br>
On the question of students, I shall deal first with all the cases where the problem does not arise so that the Committee can consider the question in context. If a student lives with a landlord or landlady, the landlord or landlady will be higher than the student in the order of precedence for establishing liability. In those circumstances, a student would not be jointly liable. Similarly, if a student lives with his or her parents, who would presumably be the tenants or owners of the property, the student will be lower in the order of assessment for liability. If a student lives in a hall of residence he or she will be exempt from the council tax. If a student lives in property entirely inhabited by students no council tax will be paid. If a student lives with a non-student, who has no income and who claims benefits, a 100 per cent rebate will be payable and the question of council tax will not arise. The only circumstance in which a student who is exempt from the tax, can be held jointly and severally liable is when the student is a co-owner or a cohabitee or a joint tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or spouse?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Clearly, in each of those cases, a bill will be payable only if the non-student, with whom the student shares, has an income.<br><br>
I have little sympathy for the case presented by the hon. Member for Dagenham. He spoke about a student owner who took in a lodger and found that, whereas no tax was payable before, it then became payable. If the owner of a property takes in a lodger, collects rent and tax arises in relation to the lodger, it is the business of the owner to ensure that it is collected in the rent. I have no sympathy for that case.<br><br>
In relation to other cases where joint and several liability may arise, I refer to the point made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) who said that we should set about making collection of the tax easier for local authorities. Where two or three people have jointly offered themselves as the tenants of a property, they are undertaking responsibility for meeting its bills by paying the rent. That is even more the case if they are co-owners of the property. I see no reason why we should say to a local authority in those circumstances, "You may not pursue these people because they happen to be students, even though they have entered into a tenancy agreement and undertaken to rent the property".<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
I am surprised that Oppsition Members should have become so concerned about the matter. If students enter an agreement to rent a property and are involved in that with someone who is a non-student, it will be clear to them that a council tax liability may arise. They will go into that agreement with their eyes open and they should either arrange that the person who is not a student—who gives rise to the incidence of the tax in the first instance—should pay the tax, or they should willingly undertake to share all the burdens of taking that rented accommodation. Certainly, it would be quite wrong to prevent the local authority from pursuing all the people who entered the agreement together for the liability which they have.<br><br>
I pick up a point made by the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), who wanted to know whether anyone under 18 could be liable for council tax. The only circumstance in which I envisage someone under 18 could be liable is listed under clause 6(2)(f), when
<br><blockquote><p>"he is the owner of the dwelling."</p></blockquote>
There is an order of precedence by which the liability for council tax is established and whereas a person who is a resident is restricted under subsection (4) to being someone
<br><blockquote><p>"who has attained the age of 18 years"</p></blockquote>
there is no such restriction on a person who is the owner of a property. If someone aged under 18 is the owner of a property which may be empty, the Committee will probably agree that it would be appropriate that council tax should be chargeable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about a 16-year-old who has been left a house in the will of his grandparents? Would it not be highly inappropriate that he should immediately fall liable for the tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the dwelling is kept empty, it would not be inapproprite. The person could put matters right in two ways. He could either establish someone in the house as a resident or establish himself as a resident. As a resident, he would not be liable. He might want to sell the property which he had inherited if he chose not to live there. In those circumstances, recent experience tells us that local authorities are usually willing to enter an agreement to postpone collection of the tax until the sale has been realised in a reasonable period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on an important point in relation to empty properties. Is there any way in which that procedure of waiting until a property is sold before the debt is paid can be made a little more formal, so that most local authorities, if not all, accept it as the way forward? At present, the procedure varies throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall that when a property is left to someone on the death of its owner, a period of exemption from community charge of six months is prescribed in regulations. That is variable locally. Our intention is that the zero charges under the standard community charge should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0187">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 309</span>
carried forward as exempt categories for the same period under the council tax. A property that was left in those circumstances would in any case enjoy a period of grace. It is difficult to legislate for a further period of grace because in most cases the original period would represent a reasonable period in which to dispose of the property.<br><br>
The other case raised in the debate was that of the severely mentally impaired. It is perhaps useful to recall that, under rating law, the severely mentally impaired had no statutory release from the payment of rates. Relieving the severely mentally impaired from the liability to pay was a novelty introduced with the commmunity charge. It was introduced because the community charge was about establishing liability. We asked people to recognise what local government cost them and to exercise their votes accordingly. Because of that, people who were severely mentally impaired were held not to be in a position to make judgments at election time and were, therefore, released from paying the community charge. The new tax has a property element and a personal element. The Government have decided that the personal element should again apply, with a discount, to a severely mentally impaired person. Under the Bill therefore, like the student, the severely mentally impaired person will be invisible and will not count. If he or she is living with another person, that person will qualify for the 25 per cent discount.<br><br>
It would not be right for a severely mentally impaired person not to be liable for the tax at all. The tax is only partly a personal tax; it is also a property tax. Some severely mentally impaired people live alone. Such circumstances are rare, but it is possible that such a person would live alone and have a carer or a rota of carers. In those cases, to expunge all liability for the tax would be wrong. If the severely mentally impaired person was of limited means, it is right that he or she would qualify for social security help. No exemption applied under the rates.<br><br>
If one accepts that a severely mentally impaired person can be liable for a property tax, just as such a person was liable for the rates, it would be illogical to say that if that person lives with a spouse or someone equally liable to pay the council tax, joint and several liability should not apply.<br><br>
If joint and several liability did not apply, some anomalous circumstances might arise. For example, despite what has been said about changing social attitudes, the situation could arise of a man with Alzheimer's disease, who traditionally earned all the money, owned the home and all the capital and had all the insurance policies. If we were to say that that person could not be held jointly and severally liable and that all the liability had to pass to his spouse, that would put us in an invidious position. The Government's legislation would be dictating to such people has to arrange their financial affairs. That point is only theoretical because in practice the financial affairs of severely mentally impaired people are generally handled by other people, but that does not, and should not, alter the position of who owns the money that others are administering on their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
behalf. I have given much thought to that situation, both before drafting the Bill and in the light of the debate, and I believe that we should not make the change that the Opposition have sought.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to fob us off with inconsistent answers. He used the Anderton case to demonstrate how a merchant seaman—according to the resident rule and because his wife has remained in what he calls his home—may be deemed to be liable, even though he was overseas. The hon. Gentleman then gave the example of a prisoner who, like the merchant seaman, is also away but who thinks of his home as the place to which he will return when he leaves prison because that is where his wife or partner lives. However, in contradiction of what the Minister said about the Anderton case, that prisoner is not considered to be jointly and severally liable.<br><br>
Finally, the Minister said that joint and several liability should be flexible so that it can accommodate people with severe mental handicaps. Perhaps he will explain how the Bill should replace the notion of joint and several liability with a flexible provision that will enable the Government to screw the tax out of people in whatever way they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is not being sensible. Her examples of the merchant seaman and the prisoner touch on the question of residence. It is a curious argument to say that a prisoner in gaol is still resident in his home. I doubt that the courts would accept it. However, one can well understand that a court might decide that a merchant seaman who leaves his home only to pursue his trade and does not establish a new residence—as a ship is not a residence in the way that a prison is—retains as his habitual residence the home to which he would return when his work did not require him to be away.<br><br>
I did not say that joint and several liability should be flexible. I went through a series of cases, explaining in each that joint and several liablity was completely appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is possible for merchant seamen to be away from home for six months. They cannot be resident at home when they are on a ship. It is also possible for a person to get a prison sentence that lasts six months. During that time, that person would not be deemed to be resident at his home address, but it would nevertheless be registered as the residence in which his wife and family lived and to which he would eventually return at the end of the sentence. The Minister's definition of "residence", to which he has struck so closely, would not apply in either case. In one case he says that a person is jointly and severally liable and in the other that a person is not. That is a contradiction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has got hold of the wrong end of the stick. The Government do not wish to define "habitual residence". Our intention is that the courts should define that. Pace what the hon. Member for Dagenham said before, but the courts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0188">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 311</span>
have reached rather clear views about residence, certainly as it affects merchant seaman. The hon. Lady disagrees with the courts—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am disagreeing with the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady happens also to be disagreeing with me because I think that the courts have got it about right. The Government believe that the question of habitual residence can be settled only by the courts because there are so many different cases. Case law can be built up only when individual cases are judged and their application to other cases is assessed. The hon. Lady has effectively underlined the wisdom of the Government's decision to allow that question to be resolved in the courts. I have run through the questions on joint and several liability and I hope that I have explained why it is appropriate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) made a magnificent speech and raised difficult issues for me to mull over. I hope that, on reflection, he will recognise the limited number of circumstances in which joint and several liability will affect students. It is within the scope of a student to recognise the consequences of entering a joint tenancy. We should not dismiss all consideration of personal responsibility. Anyone who enters an arrangement in which council tax liability will arise can make arrangements for that coucil tax to be paid by the person who has an income, or make arrangements by which both people recognise that joint and several liability will apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to press the Minister further on the joint and several liability of sufferers from Alzheimer's disease and other forms of severe mental impairment. The Opposition pressed the Government on the issue for a long time and they finally gave in. They admitted that those sufferers should not have to pay a personal poll tax on the grounds that they could not understand their liability under the Bill and could not exercise their right to vote because of their severe mental impairment. Such a person could not be expected to be responsible for a partner's bill. How can the Minister justify joint and several liability when he has accepted that those people have no personal liability?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was one of those who took part in that long campaign for people with Alzheimer's disease. Where does liability lie in the case of people with Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia who live with a brother or sister and have done so for a long time? In the case of two elderly aunts of mine, the elder, who had always taken responsibility for the household bills and so on, contracted Alzheimer's disease. Neither of my aunts, who were aged 90 and 88, were as capable as they should have been of taking responsibility. What would be the position in such a case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A man and wife living together are classed as a two-person household, in a case in my constituency, the wife had a severe illness and was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
admittted for a time to a mental institution, and her husband was therefore classed as living in a single-person household. The health authority's policy is to discharge long-term patients back into the community and the woman, who had not recovered and was still very sick, returned to the home to be cared for by her husband. The house became a two-person household once again. The husband, who was caring for his wife, a job that should have been done by the health authority, therefore had to pay an extra charge. There is something wrong when a person has to pay extra for looking after a sick relative who has been discharged because of a health authority's policy, not because the patient would be better off at home.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall deal with the point of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about the brother and sister. The matter would depend on their property arrangements. They would be jointly and severally liable if they ranked equally in the order of criteria. If they were joint owners or joint tenants of a property, they could be jointly and severally liable. If the brother owned the house and the sister was living in her brother's house, only one of them would be liable.<br><br>
In the case raised by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), I was not sure whether he meant that the woman who had been discharged was severely mentally impaired. The severely mentally impaired qualify for a 25 per cent discount under the Bill. The return home of such a woman would not increase the council tax bill. For the personal element of the tax, the severely mentally impaired should have a discount.<br><br>
That leads to the point made by the hon. Member for Maryhill. The personal discount should be available to Alzheimer's disease sufferers. However, such people may be liable for the property element of the tax. They can be so liable if they live alone or if they live with someone, through joint and several liability. To be severely mentally impaired is not to be without resources. It does not mean that such people have given up ownership of property or given up being a tenant or that they have surrendered any of the other attributes of their former life. Usually, someone will be administering their affairs on their behalf. That is an important practical consideration, but it should not alter where the legal liability lies. To pursue a severely mentally impaired person for liability, it would be necessary to deal with whoever was administering that person's affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has put himself in an incoherent position. A person suffering from Alzheimer's disease may have property and financial resources. The Government should have stuck to their original ideological position that people with Alzheimer's disease should pay personal poll tax because they have property which other people administer for them. We persuaded the Government to be less hardhearted, but the Minister is trying to have it both ways by saying that people are not liable to pay their own share but are liable to pay that of their spouse, brother or sister. That is nonsense. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0189">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
has to be one or the other—the Minister cannot have it both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady fundamentally misunderstands the tax, which is both a property tax and a personal tax. The person who is held jointly and severally liable is jointly and severally liable for the bill that comes to the household. The bill is made up of a property element and a personal element. That a person does not qualify to pay the personal element does not alter the fact that the bill covers the couple living together in the household. That position is logical and superior to that under the rates, under which severely mentally impaired people had no let-off from their bills. There is a danger, in the Opposition's wish for social justice, of intervening in the arrangements of households and couples where there are Alzheimer's disease sufferers or other severely mentally impaired people. We should be careful of such unwarranted, unjustified interference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not say it again, but I feel that the Government are getting themselves into the same mess that they were in with the poll tax. The Minister is putting the emphasis on their residence—as with tied cottages and the farmers. The definition of "severely mentally handicapped" depends on an individual doctor. Many severely mentally handicapped people who live independently—if we can call it independence—often live in charitable, sheltered housing. Under the old rating system, because the institution was owned by a charity it was exempt from rates.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The Minister appears to be saying that that will no longer happen. A charity may run sheltered housing—not a residential home—where individuals or couples have their own flat and their own key. In the past, those people would not have been liable to pay rates because it was run by a charity, and under the poll tax they were exempt because of their severe mental impairment, but now they will be liable for at least the property element of the council tax. For the first time, such people will be brought into the taxation system. However much effort was needed to get the Government to admit that severely mentally handicapped people with Alzheimer's disease should be exempt, they did so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did too, not just the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Tory Members on this Committee voted against the amendments that we tabled in that Committee. They happily accepted their Minister's arguments against the amendments.<br><br>
The Minister may argue that many of those people will be exempt because they will not have sufficient income to pay the tax and they will be covered by the rebate system. Many people just inside the severely mentally impaired category will be discouraged from seeking employment. Such people can gain a little independence by having a job—often
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
in a sheltered workshop or in a place where they can be looked after during their work—but if they are paid a wage that puts them outside the rebate system and they have to pay this tax, it will not be worth their while taking on that job and whatever little bit of independence they have will be taken away from them. It is a game and the Government are showing a hardheartedness that is beyond belief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a somewhat uncertain, not to say bizarre beginning to his speech. He attempted to link the Anderton judgment on residence to the subject of the amendment, joint and several liability, and he was found out by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo). He reminded me of a missile that once launched could not be recalled. He seemed irritated at my attempts to recall him- If he insists on behaving in such an erratic fashion, he can expect further interventions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seemed equally uncertain when he finally got on to the amendment. He referred to the general principle of joint and several liability and he attempted, quite rightly, to draw a distinction between a property tax—a rates-type tax—which was properly a household tax where joint and several liability might be appropriate, and a personal tax, such as the poll tax, where joint and several liability would be inappropriate. That surprised me because I have always understood the hon. Gentleman to be a fervent supporter of every aspect of the poll tax legislation and the poll tax scheme, including the principle of joint and several liability for the personal poll tax.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's action was somewhat bizarre. He said, "On the basis of the distinction that I draw, I now decide that for this purpose the council tax is a property tax and is to be put in that category for the purpose of deciding whether joint and several liability should apply."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It intrigues me when the Minister talks about Alzheimer's disease. He said that sufferers would get 25 per cent discount, but joint and severally liable for the property element. If a couple live in rented accommodation and do not have an interest in the property, would they be relieved of the property element? The Minister's example was of people who were jointly and severally liable and owned their property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is quite the point, but I shall develop my hon. Friend's point about Alzheimer's disease later. The Minister, who is famed for his logical application to these matters, is guilty of illogicality in this respect. In deciding for this purpose that the council tax is a property tax where joint and several liability would be appropriate, the hon. Gentleman appears to deny what was asserted with such pride by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). The Under-Secretary constantly said that one of the great virtues of the council tax was that it was part-personal—that is 50 per cent—and part-property. On what basis has the Minister decided unilaterally that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0190">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
it is a property tax tout court, and not the curious hybrid that it is represented to be—and is—for other purposes. There are some curious inconsistences in the Minister's position and we have not yet considered the precise categories with which the amendment deals.<br><br>
We were drawing a parallel between paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of schedule 1 and those categories of people who are disregarded for discount purposes. If they are disregarded for discount purposes in terms of their personal liability, why should they find themselves jointly and severally liable for someone else's bill? The Minister tried to argue in respect of detainees that the problem did not arise. He asserted that they could not be liable as they were not resident.<br><br>
The Minister was asked about the category of ownership in clause 6(2)(f). He was bound to concede that, in that category, prisoners would be liable even though they were not resident. I was intrigued by the absolute confidence with which he asserted that a prisoner was not resident at his usual home. Notwithstanding the Anderton case, it is common ground among all members of the Committee that there is a paucity of case law. The Minister constantly says that it is not for us to decide what is a "residence" and that we must wait for the courts to decide. I am lost in admiration of the idea that the Minister should know in advance so clearly and authoritatively that the courts will decide that a prisoner is resident in prison and not at his usual home. That is astonishing. The hon. Gentleman should be promoted to the Court of Appeal, such is his authority in these matters.<br><br>
The only case law—the Anderton case—would point to a different conclusion. Mr. Anderton volunteered to be somewhere else, although I assume that a prisoner does not volunteer to be somewhere else and would very much like to be at his residence, where he would be liable to pay for the council tax. I found the Minister's contribution on that point lacking in persuasiveness.<br><br>
The Minister attempted to deal with the third category and the problem of students. He chose to believe that our argument on students was based on fairness and equity. There may well be cases where considerations of fairness and equity enter the picture, but that was not the burden of our argument and it was not the burden of the argument that appealed to the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire), who has mysteriously left the Committee, perhaps to consult his conscience or to be absent when he is required to make up his mind on the issue. The point of the argument was not equity but the horrendously complex and unpredictable position in which various students and non-students who live together could find themselves. We must bear in mind that their status might change, as might their relationships.<br><br>
The Minister said that that argument can be dismissed, and claimed that a student who took in a lodger would do so with his eyes open as he would clearly understand the consequences. He was envisaging a wonderful student who was almost as gifted on the provision as the hon. Gentleman is on residents and detainees. That student would be so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
familiar with the intricacies of the law—not yet published—that he or she would be aware, up to the last minute of each day, of the liability consequences of the tenants becoming cohabitees or any student tenants giving up their courses. Will the hon. Gentleman recognise that problems will be caused by administrative complexities? I accept there may also be difficulties caused by equity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even if students were completely au fait with the regulations and the practicalities of living in university and college towns, the only accommodation available to them might be non-student residences. We are dealing with the vagaries of the property market as much as we are dealing with the vagaries of the regulations. I am not suggesting that students should evade their responsibilities and camp out. In reality, students will take what accommodation is available and, in so doing, will fall foul of the Minister's analysis of the cause of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. However clear about the provisions the student landlady, student landlord or student lodger may be, it is by no means clear that there will be an element of choice that enables them to act on the accurate judgment that they will be expected to make.<br><br>
The third category of people mentioned in the Minister's speech was of those who are severely mentally impaired. I suppose that people who suffer from Alzheimer's disease are the most obvious examples. I was astonished and appalled by what the hon. Gentleman said. There could just about be a case for saying of his argument that that is where logic took him, but it is not where a decent conscience or decent social responsibility would take him.<br><br>
The Minister will recall—as will most members of the Committee—that paragraph 2 of schedule 1 exists because of the long, arduous and eventually successful campaign to provide such people with concessions and exemptions. That is why those who fall into the category of being severely mentally impaired are disregarded for the purpose of the discount. They have a status discount. We welcome that. The hon. Gentleman says, however, that they will be liable in appropriate circumstances—if they lived alone and so on—for the 50 per cent property element.<br><br>
Let us assume—I fear that we must—that the Government are hardhearted enough to make such a calculation. People can be granted a 25 per cent discount because they are severely mentally impaired and unable to look after their affairs but, if it comes to the point, they will have to pay the 50 per cent element. As I understand it, that is not what the Minister is saying because that might be where logic—although based on a steely heart—takes him. His argument is an affront not only to a good conscience but to logic. The Minister is claiming that, under joint and several liability, that person who on grounds of compassion is exempted from the 25 per cent of tax for which he or she is personally responsible is then liable not just for 50 per cent of the property tax but for the 25 per cent element that is owed by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0191">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
someone else. If that is so, will the Minister back down and agree that the rules in line with that flinty logic on which he is operating must be changed? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have sufficient humility to consider the matter. I am not claiming that I am right, just postulating what I understand to be his position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In many of the instances that my hon. Friends raised, a person may be so mentally infirm that under the Mental Health Act 1983 his liabilities have been transferred to the Court of Protection. Such a person could be pursued through the Court of Protection for what he or she owes. That should never be the intention of any Government. The purpose of the Court of Protection is to protect mentally infirm people from persecution and from attempts to take from them resources rightfully allocated to them. It is being suggested that resources that are not rightfully theirs can be pursued through the Court of Protection. That is standing logic on its head.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend adds weight to the case. Essentially, the case is that it cannot be right to exempt—on grounds of compassion or any other grounds that we may adduce—people in these painful categories from a 25 per cent personal liability, and then consciously and deliberately to legislate to make them liable for the 25 per cent element owned by someone else. That cannot be right. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the logic of the argument, and I appeal to other hon. Members to consult their consciences. I do not know whether the Minister wants to respond at this point—I hope that he will.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 5, line 10, at end insert—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Subsection (3) above shall not apply to any person in respect of any day when he had an income which would not have exceeded his applicable income as a single person or where applicable as a single parent for the purposes of entitlement to income support calculated according to Part 1 of the Social Security Act 1986.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 125, in clause 9, page 6, line 30, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Subsection (1) above shall not apply to any person in respect of any day when he had an income which would not have exceeded his applicable income as a single person or where applicable as a single parent for the purposes of entitlement to income support calculated according to Part 1 of the Social Security Act 1986.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments raise similar considerations to those that we discussed in the last group of amendments. I hope that they will not involve such weighty matters of conscience, but I have little confidence that the outcome will be any different. Some hon. Members have demonstrated that they are impervious to the claims of conscience, let alone logic.<br><br>
The amendments deal with joint and several liability. They recognise the fact that joint and several liability is always retrospective, in that a person only becomes liable on that basis for a bill due at some time in the past. Therefore, it can apply to someone who may have had little or no income in the period covered by the bill. If the jointly liable person had known at the time that he or she was liable for the bill, it might have been possible to claim a rebate or other assistance. The problem arises because, when the bill finally becomes due and the joint and several liability applies, it will be too late to apply for a rebate.<br><br>
Let us suppose that a man lives with his mother and that they are joint tenants. Such a case would be relevant under clause 6 and would be dealt with by amendment No. 123. If the man loses his job in April 1993 when the council tax allegedly will be in force, he can claim income support from that date. Let us suppose that the council tax bill is in his mother's name and that she does not qualify for rebate because her earnings are too high. However, in April 1994 the mother sets up home with a new partner and the son discoverd after she has gone that she has not paid the council tax bill for 1993–94.<br><br>
Under clause 6 the council will expect the son to clear the bill. Had the bill been in the son's name, he could have claimed a 100 per cent rebate on the grounds of his income. However, under the existing rebate legislation, it is unlikely that he will qualify for a backdated rebate for that debt. So he is stuck with that bill because of the joint and several liability imposed on him.<br><br>
Let us take another case that will fall under clause 9 and amendment No. 125. A mother has two children and her only income is child benefit. When her husband leaves her in December 1993, she discovers that the council tax bill is not paid. No one knows where her husband has gone, so the council uses clause 9 to make her responsible for the debt. Had she been a single parent throughout the whole period to which the debt relates, she would have qualified for a 100 per cent rebate. Again, she would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0192">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
be unable, retrospectively, to claim a rebate to cover the period of the council tax bill which was unpaid and for which she discovered that she was jointly and severally liable.<br><br>
The amendments would offer limited protection to people in the situations which I described. They would ensure that people who would have qualified for income support in their own right during the period of the debt cannot be pursued for it.<br><br>
This is a simple point; it is persuasive in justice and logic and I hope that on this occasion the Government will see sense and show compassion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments follow on from the previous group. They would provide that a person whose income was at or below the income support level could not be held jointly and severally liable with others. Amendment No. 123 to clause 6 deals with joint and several liability among joint owners, tenants or licensees; amendment No. 125 to clause 9 is concerned with the joint and several liability of couples.<br><br>
In the context of the previous group, my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities explained why joint and several liability is a property tax as well as a personal tax; it is right that all the people who are joint owners or tenants of a property should be liable for it. That is not the same as saying that the tax bill should not reflect their individual circumstances. A parallel case would be people on low incomes who can claim housing benefit but who, none the less, remain liable to pay their rent to the landlord.<br><br>
Amendment No. 125, which amends the clause about the liability of couples, is particularly misconceived because it is based on the applicable amount for a single person. The income of a couple must, of course, be assessed against the applicable amount for a couple. A couple who earn less than that amount will be entitled to 100 per cent rebate of the tax. Thus, although they will be liable, they will not be required to pay anything. Nevertheless, it is still appropriate for them to be liable; that ensures that they receive a bill and so are aware to their local authority's spending.<br><br>
It is quite consistent to provide rebates for people on low incomes while such people remain jointly and severally liable with others.<br><br>
The amendments run counter to the basic idea of liability under the council tax. therefore, I urge the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot pretend to be surprised by the Under-Secretary's reply, but I am disappointed and my disappointment is no less keen for being expected. However, as the hon. Gentleman's reply is unsatisfactory, heartless and irrational, I am inclined to consider pressing the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend illustrated clearly specific cases that could and would apply under the new legislation, yet the Under-Secretary did not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
respond to my hon. Friend's points—he simply read from a prepared statement. If we are to have a proper discussion about this matter, the Under-Secretary should at least inform us of the Government's views on the cases that were presented. My hon. Friend should continue to press the hon. Gentleman on those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend; he was, rightly, a little more rigorous in his treatment of the Under-Secretary than I was intended to be. As my hon. Friend has suggested to the Under-Secretary that he should deal with some of the issues, it is worth asking the hon. Gentleman to respond to the two cases which I described. On the basis of joint and several liability, people found themselves liable for a bill that had arisen over a period when they had no income. Under the Government's proposed rebate system, would those people be able, retrospectively, to claim rebates for that period and for that purpose? If so, we might feel more kindly disposed toward the Under-Secretary, but if not, what answer would he give to people in such a position? I notice that he is busily reading a note from his officials, so I shall continue to speak for a few more moments in the hope that he can not only read it, but absorb and understand it and then reproduce it in a comprehensive manner. As he now looks quietly confident, I shall sit down and let him enlighten us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's first point was about debtors. I apologise for having been talking to someone when he made it. Someone who has left a property but was liable for the period in which a bill was not paid remains liable for that period and the local authority can pursue the person to pay the bill for the property that has been left. There is no difficulty about that. It is well known that housing benefit can be claimed up to 52 weeks backwards from the date on which an application was made. It is up to the local authority to use its discretion in considering the circumstances of a particular application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend that those are not relevant and mildly helpful reminders of a known position, but they do not really deal with the problem which I have raised. I accept that it is always true that in the case of joint and several liability the person originally liable will remain liable and remedies can be pursued against that person if he or she can be found. However, the purpose of joint and several liability is that if the person who was originally liable cannot be found or is proved to have no means with which to pay the debt, there is someone else to turn to. The purpose of the provisions set out in clauses 6 and 9 is to allow councils to look for payment to the other person or persons who are jointly and severally liable. That is what happens under the poll tax legislation, and it will continue under the Bill. Although the Minister is right, his point is scarcely relevant to the sort of problems that we describe.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the constitutional niceties of looking for those registered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
liable will not be followed in most instances. As the Minister made clear, the purpose is to make the collection easy. What is easier than going for the individual who still lives in the property? Local authorities are under increasing pressure and have the difficulty of ensuring a reasonable cash flow. On many occasions, the other person will have less resources than the person who was primarily liable. It is an administrative nightmare.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend demonstrates a much greater knowledge of the practical world than the Minister. That is exactly how the rules apply. I cannot believe that any hon. Member who conducts a regular advice surgery can be unaware of those problems.<br><br>
What the Minister had to say about benefit may be in some circumstances a helpful and partial answer, but it does not deal fully with the problem. Will the Minister say where in the legislation, where in the scheme of things, is there a solution to the two problems that I have attempted to describe that arise under clauses 6 and 9, which will cause such difficulty to people with literally no means during the relevant period but who nevertheless are suddenly landed with a bill under the joint and several liability provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to give another example, which will increasingly occur because of higher unemployment. If an employed person loses his job, gets income support, and then leaves the household, and if the person remaining is also on income support, theoretically they would be 100 per cent exempted, but only from when the income support becomes claimable. For the period prior to that, if no council tax has been paid by the employed person the person on income support becomes liable. As a result, those who are on income support who are exempted will be pursued under income support regulations for recovery of someone else's personal liability. The DSS will become a collection agency. I am certain that local councils will apply for attachment orders. The Minister looks puzzled, but such practicalities will arise in their thousands. Someone who is 100 per cent exempted will become liable because of the circumstances that I have explained. The Bill must contain safeguards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend puts the problem directly and in such a way that even the Minister might claim to understand it. I hope that the Minister, understanding the problem, will give us a solution. We have not yet heard that solution. I hope that he might now be able to tell us where in the legislative scheme he proposes to make regulations to cover such matters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that there are two ways for local authorities to deal wth that matter. If one person was exempt from paying the council tax because he or she was on a low income and the other person who was paying the council tax left at the end of the year, the local authority could pursue the person liable but who did not pay the council tax—a solution open to the local authority. Or, in circumstances such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
as those referred to by the hon. Gentleman where the local authority may decide not to pursue the person who was due to pay and who has disappeared, the council has the option of using the council tax system to allow benefit to be backdated for up to 52 weeks. That seems to give an acceptable measure of flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must agree that nothing in the rebate scheme would allow that to happen. Where is the provision on which the hon. Gentleman suggests that we should rely?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in the current regulations on housing benefit and on community charge benefit that one can backdate—[Hon. Members: "No."] It is. Those regulations provide that money can be backdated for up to 52 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The cries of astonishment from Opposition Members reveal all too clearly how unconvincing we find that explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister clearly does not know the social security legislation that he has trotted through the Division Lobbies to vote for. One only becomes liable for a benefit depending on the circumstances at the time of claiming. Someone who is not liable for the benefit is not liable. Someone cannot be liable for a benefit retrospectively on the basis that the person whom he or she was married to or living with has left. It is not possible to backdate benefit for anything beyond the qualification date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has demonstrated a knowledge of these regulations which is far greater than that of the Minister. The existing rebate scheme does not make it possible for people retrospectively to obtain rebates for a bill for which they were not initially liable but for which they have become liable retrospectively. That is the problem. We want to know how it will be tackled in the rebate scheme suggested for the council tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday Conservative Members derided me for referring to future legislation, but this morning I spent time in Committee Room 9 discussing the Family Credit (General Amendment) Regulations 1991 and Income Support (General) Amendment No. 4 Regulations 1991. Both sets of regulations, surprisingly, change the ground rules. They suggest that people will be able to switch between income support and family credit as they go in search of, or are forced to go in search of, part-time low-paid work. That will unsettle the whole structure of benefits, and I am sure that the Minister has not taken that into account in his suggestions. The proposed social security legislation has not been reconciled with the promises that have been made in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not had an answer to the known and existing problem of how rebate can be claimed retrospectively for a liability that was not in existence earlier, and my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has made it clear that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
the problem might get worse under the regulations that he has described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the Minister of State appears to be making it clear this week that the rebate system is to be changed still further so that the qualifications for those who are entitled to a graduated rebate under the regulations that were discussed by the working party of the Department of Social Security in the summer are to be changed? Those whose income is slightly above the social security level, who may have to struggle to get a little job that takes them just above the level and who were originally entitled to at least some graduated amount, will be disqualified unless they are on social security. Those who struggle to help themselves will be disqualified even though the result of the discussions in Committee Room 9 will supposedly allow people to switch between benefits. They are to be entitled to family credit if they get a low-paid job, which subsidises them in that job in a way which our national minimum wage proposals seek to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution, which adds to the picture of concern about which we seem unable to elicit from the Under-Secretary any satisfactory answer. As I am wont to notice such things, I saw that the Under-Secretary received yet another piece of paper from his officials and noted that he managed to read it during the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). I am not sure whether he will use that.<br><br>
Yet a further piece of paper has arrived. One of the officials is anxious that the Under-Secretary may not have quite got it right. As the hon. Gentleman has now read all three pieces of paper, will he concede his error or offer a new solution? We still wish to hear a convincing explanation of his remedy for the obvious problems that have arisen in the past. My hon. Friends tell me—I take their expertise for granted—that the problems will worsen. We expect the Under-Secretary to confess his error and to explain his remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat the point because the Opposition have not understood the lucid explanation that they received from my hon. Friend the Minister about joint and several liability. Claims for council tax benefit can be backdated in respect of liability that has already arisen. Only liable people will be able to claim council tax benefit and those people will be jointly and severally liable from the outset. Joint and several liability exists from day one. In the case mentioned by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) of a couple who share a house on 1 April 1993, they would be jointly and severally liable. The fact that one of them would receive a 100 per cent rebate due to a low income would not remove that joint and several liability. If one of the partners does a runner on 1 April 1994 and the local authority cannot find that person, they would approach the remaining partner who would have joint and several liability. The remaining partner would be entitled, if he or she could show
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
good cause, to receive the 100 per cent rebate for the period 1 April 1993 to 1 April 1994 because the joint and several liability applied from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not accepted as good cause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that that is not accepted as good cause. It is for the courts and for the local authorities administering the regulations to make judgments about what counts as good cause in the light of particular cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The Under-Secretary does not understand how the phrase "good cause" is interpreted in social security legislation. He has clearly never been to or accompanied anyone to a social security tribunal. One cannot claim a benefit because of a backdated change of circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, that is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. The Chairman is not responsible for what the Under-Secretary says. The hon. Lady is entitled to join in the debate on the amendment and she may raise her point with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) may not have raised a point of order, but she made a powerful point which was well heard and understood by the Committee, including the Under-Secretary. It will also appear in the record.<br><br>
The Minister of State, with all the authority of the Government—[Hon. Members: "Promotion."] Oh, he is not a Minister of State. Perhaps now we know why. Whatever the Minister's precise status, and I apologise for trying to promote him prematurely to a level that he may never attain, he claimed to speak with the authority of the Government. He gave us an interpretation, doubtless provided by his officials, that he claimed was crystal clear. When challenged by my Hon. Friends, who said that that was not the way in which the rules were currently interpreted—"good cause" is defined more rigidly and less generously than he suggested—he took refuge in the sort of point in which his hon. Friend the Minister took refuge when challenged on the meaning of "residence". The hon. Gentleman said, "It is for the courts to decide". That is precisely the point.<br><br>
People—some in very difficult and painful, but real circumstances, who do not have a hope in hell of going to court to get a ruling—want to know what hard and fast, black-and-white provisions will guarantee them help. It is not good enough for the Under-Secretary to say, "It is for the courts to decide, but we think that there is good cause." Unfortunately—or, perhaps, fortunately—what he says in Committee is not taken into account by the courts—how wise they are. The courts will not listen to what he says that the regulations mean. They will look at the black letter of the law and interpret it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0195">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
according to their legal judgment and principles. The evidence shows that that judgment is made against people who seek that sort of help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The definition of "good cause" is clear and explicit. It is a narrow legal definition. Good cause is shown by a claimant who explains—to the tribunal, not the court—precisely why he or she did not apply for a benefit or relief when he or she believed that the relief became due. Good cause is not shown by a claimant who says, "if I had known six months ago, on 1 April, that that roving rat of a man would leave me, I would have claimed."<br><br>
If 99.9 per cent of cases do not constitute good cause, it will not be possible to claim retrospectively benefit to which one would have been entitled while in a partnership in which the income was such that no benefits would have applied. The Under-Secretary has raised a red herring.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much indebted to my hon. Friend. Without in any way wishing to denigrate the excellent officials—with whom I look forward to having a long and fruitful relationship—I observe that Ministers benefit from the advice of officials, but I have the benefit of advice from my hon. Friend, which has proved, in this instance at least, to be more reliable and well-informed—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us take a vote and see.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to a real vote. We have yet to see from the Under-Secretary any recognition that the point which he put to the Committee, in an attempt to diffuse the issue, carried no conviction because it was not accurate. Will the hon. Gentleman now concede that the tribunals and the courts, were it ever to go that far, would not take the view—that is the evidence—that he so confidently asserted they would?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The courts would not take that view. The heart of the problem is that promises are made here by the Department and the Minister or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment about matters that are covered by the DSS. It is abundantly clear that the Under-Secretary does not talk to his colleagues in the DSS, because they instruct their officials to give advice that contradicts the advice that he offers the Committee. The interpretative guide notes that are given out with DSS legislation will advise the tribunals how to judge such cases and that will be much more harshly than the Under-Secretary suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I well understand the alacrity with which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment sought to distance himself from his ministerial colleagues—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now, the hon. Gentleman says that he is sorry. I understand that perfectly. I also understand why the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales is becoming fed up and has to duck as various
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
bits of paper fly backwards and forwards. I have not been able to keep count, but at least five have been passed to him, although I am not certain that he is becoming any more enlightened as they are written.<br><br>
There is an element of light relief in this episode, but it contains a kernel of deadly seriousness. The issue is certainly of great consequence to the people whose lives are directly affected by it. Minister's have yet to give any assurance that they have thought about or have a solution to the problem. Since the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales last spoke in the debate he has been able to read a further half-dozen bits of paper—at least he is proving to be a fast reader. Will he now rise and give us the benefit of the advice that he has received? I wonder if it will be more helpful than the advice that he gave us earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that the advice remains the same. In the case of two people, one of whom does a runner after a year in occupation, joint and several liability applies to both, although a 100 per cent exemption may apply because of low income. If the local authority made no attempt to collect the tax between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994, when the person who was in receipt of full income left, several courses of action could be followed.<br><br>
Under present regulations, a person who can show good cause to the local authority may have benefit backdated. When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security makes the council tax benefit regulations—they have not yet been made—he will be entitled to include such provisions, and Opposition Members will be able to scrutinise them.<br><br>
The local authority may also pursue through the courts the person in receipt of income who does a runner. The local authority may also seek a deduction from the benefit of the person remaining in the property if that is practical. It may also decide that there is no point in pursuing a person with no income for the debt owed by the other person.<br><br>
A range of avenues will be open to local authorities. The words "good cause" are included in legislation to allow for discretion, so that local authority adjudicators can make judgments on the individual circumstances of the cases presented to them. In the example suggested by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), in which one person does a runner, the remaining person can put forward to the local authority adjudicator the case that there is good cause why he should not be pursued for the other person's liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot believe that officials would waste their time and effort writing messages that all said the same thing. I assume that the argument advanced as each piece of paper arrived, but, mysteriously, from what the hon. Gentleman has told us, it does not seem to have changed. A mystery is building up. There is an obvious lack of communication despite the increasingly frantic production of bits of paper. I know what the problem is—they are probably written in Welsh. The officials assume that a Minister at the Welsh Office can read Welsh—that would be a mistake.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
The serious matter is that the Under-Secretary has done nothing to deal with what will happen when applicants are asked why they did not apply when the liability arose. They might say that they did not have a clue that they were jointly and severally liable from April 1993, under section 6 or section 9 of the Local Government Finance Act 1991, as they were not familiar with that legislation. Therefore, they will be asked whether they had good cause for delaying their applications although, unknown to them, their liability arose technically and legally at the beginning of the financial year. The answer that they will give is that they did not have good cause. That is the problem. Cannot the Under-Secretary see that that will be so? As they cannot meet the test, they will not receive the help that he assured us they will receive.<br><br>
If the Under-Secretary understands the problem, we want him to assure us that he will deal with it in the regulations to be made under the Bill. If he will tell local authorities that people should have their housing benefit and rebate backdated in such circumstances, we shall be happy. But if he insists that this provision must be maintained, that will simply not be good enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend note the last option that the Under-Secretary gave to local authorities—that they could write off that amount? As at the end of October, 64 per cent of the poll tax remained uncollected in Scotland, a large proportion of which involves small sums. Is the Under-Secretary saying that if a local authority decides that the tax is not worth collecting in such circumstances, central Government would make good that sum, or would local authorities' revenues be decreased?<br><br>
I agree that the circumstances that my hon. Friend mentioned may not involve many people, but generally there will be enormous numbers of people who are not worth pursuing—probably accounting for most of the 64 per cent of uncollected tax. Are we receiving a new ruling on the poll tax—official guidance that local authorities can write off such uncollected sums?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The problem is not minor or marginal; in totality, it is important to local government finance. The Under-Secretary just gives advice that is almost equally unsatisfactory to those who are required to pay bills and to the local authorities that are trying to collect the money. Characteristically, the hon. Gentleman—I do not say this in a personal sense—and the Government duck out of the issue and take refuge in the fact that the courts will decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In essence, we are discussing the enforcement of debt collection. If the Under-Secretary will not give way on the issue of joint and several liability, there is another way of approaching the matter. He might care to tell the Committee whether he agrees with me. The hon. Gentleman is prepared to assist individuals, if they show good cause, in meeting the costs of their former partner. In law, should not that be the other way around? Should not the billing authority show good cause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
before it can take any steps under joint and several liability? If the hon. Gentleman is serious about the problem, should not a clause be inserted in the Bill requiring local authorities to show good cause before they take steps to obtain attachment of earning orders, deductions from benefits, distraint orders or legal proceedings for imprisonment?</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As so often, my hon. Friend makes a powerful case and is absolutely right on the practical issues.<br><br>
The real issue is that the formulation in which the Minister is taking refuge places the onus of proof on the person on whom the liability is being imposed. That person has to show good cause why he or she did not apply for rebate at the relevant time. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) was right when he said in an earlier intervention that when confronted with the choice of pursuing somebody who has disappeared, who may or may not have resources and whose whereabouts are unknown, or of dealing with a mother with small children who is left in the council tenancy, of course, the local authority will approach the remaining tenant. She will be told, to her undoubted surprise and consternation, "You are jointly and severally liable for the bill your husband failed to pay and, what's more, you have been jointly and severally liable from the moment that it was due."<br><br>
7.15 pm<br><br>
When we add to that that the onus is on the poor unfortunate woman to prove why she did not apply for rebate from the earliest possible moment, we can understand why the issue becomes such a problem. The Minister is faced with the dilemma that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) described. If he says that local authorities have discretion to accept that all that was for a good cause and implies, as I believe he seeks to do, that he hopes that they might, that has major significance for the collecting efforts of local authorities which are encountering such problems in collecting poll tax. Undoubtedly, they will have similar problems in collecting the council tax. If the Minister is saying, however, that he is quite content with the present position, he will leave everybody in a most unsatisfactory state.<br><br>
Notwithstanding all the other refusals to face those problems by the Minister's ministerial colleagues in relation to other issues, on this issue at least will he not take refuge in the interpretation to be placed by tribunals and courts on the relevant phrase? Will he tell us what the Government intend should happen? I heard the hon. Gentleman say to one of his hon. Friends, "There's no reason why it should be compulsory, is there?" I assume that he meant "mandatory". That related to the award of rebate for the relevant period. Why should it not be mandatory in those circumstances? If someone who, in ordinary circumstances, would have qualified for benefit unexpectedly found that there was retrospective liability for a bill which had never presented itself before or which—this would be the position in many

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
cases—had been assumed to be paid, why should it not be mandatory for benefit to be available for that period?<br><br>
If the Minister would say that he accepts that case, that he will advise his ministerial colleagues in the Department of Social Security to provide legislation to that effect, or that he intends to make regulations under the Bill, we would be happy. I hope that he will now give us that assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that assurance because the matter depends on the circumstances prevailing in an individual case. There could be opportunities for fraud and if the hon. Gentleman believes that the benefit should be mandatory, two people could be in collusion to commit such a fraud.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to schedule 4, with the heading "Enforcement: Engand and Wales". Paragraph 6 allows for deductions from income support. In extremis, a local authority has power, if it wishes to use it, to take from a person on income support, who would have a 100 per cent rebate, the deductions for which he is jointly and severally liable. It must be left to the common sense of that person's local authority to deal with the case in the light of the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a previous answer, the Under-Secretary said that regulations from the Department of Social Security would come before the House. I believe that the matter is covered in schedule 9. We are exceptionally suspicious now because when the housing benefit rules were changed on the introduction of the poll tax, we were promised regulations, but they emerged as transitional arrangements to ease the effects of the poll tax. When those transitional arrangements ended, people felt the harsh blast of the change. In his discussions with his counterpart in the Department of Social Security, what assurances has the Minister been given?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For some reason, the supply of notes to the Minister has dried up. Perhaps it is a shortage of paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has no appreciation, unlike those of us who have represented poor constituents, of how the system works and how the Government have tried to design the social security system to ensure that people get as little as possible rather than the maximum that the Government can afford. Under the present regulations for the poll tax, it is clear that if deductions are already being made from income support, in particular for gas, electricity or rent, there comes a point where nothing more can be deducted under the law. In case after case, the DSS has simply refused to deduct, which leaves local authorities yet again in the sort of mess that we have in Scotland, where 64 per cent of the poll tax is uncollected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It shows a remarkable insensitivity on the part of the Minister that, in order to deflate the barrage of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
criticism that he now faces, he should have pointed to the provisions of paragraph 6 of schedule 4, which are a means of squeezing yet more blood out of the stone. It is another example of the Minister's priorities and how Ministers think about such things. He is now being advised by his officials that it is necessary to retain the discretion to judge individual cases, because there is a possibility of fraud. I used to teach criminal law and the law of tort. It always seemed to me that in most cases where a question of fraud arose the onus of proof was on those alleging the fraud. It is remarkable that people in the most vulnerable circumstances should be compared with people accused of fraud in their tax affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As in the Guinness case, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. I wonder whether the Minister would be quite so keen to impose upon those rather more well-heeled people who are sometimes accused of fraud the onus of proving that they were not fraudulent. Yet that is what he suggests as a solution to the problem when the issue is the difference between painful penury and utter penury. The Minister says that the onus of proof is on those who are claiming relief and help. I cannot believe that that is what he means, although it is all of a part with the attitude generally demonstrated by the Government.<br><br>
The Minister has shown a good deal of good humour while sitting down, but much less when he gets to his feet. Nothwithstanding his good humour, I hope that he realises that he has been confronted with several serious points and a formidable range of expertise—as demonstrated by my hon. Friends—far greater than shown elsewhere in the Room. Yet the Minister is unable to give a satisfactory reply.<br><br>
I may be going further than my hon. Friends would wish, but before we press the amendment to a Division I shall make one more attempt to persuade the Minister to assure us that he will bring forward new regulations to deal with the problem and that he will consider the matter in good faith, bringing forward a solution at the earliest opportunity? I know that I am tempting fate by such a suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not that we do not trust my hon. Friend but in case he is going too far, let me say that we should all be happy with that suggestion if the good faith includes the possibility of bringing forward regulations that make the billing authority have to show good cause. If that is part of what my hon. Friend proposes, I am happy with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my point; in comparable circumstances, it would be for the prosecuting authority to take on the onus of proof and show good cause. I hope that the Minister will say that he will consider the matter in good faith. He can be in no doubt that a problem exists. Will he now give us that modified assurance at least?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise for the final time in this debate because it seems that the Opposition are attempting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
a not-very-successful filibuster. It is clear to those listening—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is challenging the Chair—inadvertently—and he must be corrected for the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I apologise. It may simply be that the Opposition do not understand, although I suspect that that is not the case, that some principles must be applied, including joint and several liability. If they are against the whole concept of joint and several liability, they should say so, otherwise the principle must stand. The local authority must have the ability to pursue someone who, in the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman, has disappeared and has left outstanding bills. It must also have the ability to pursue the other person who is jointly and severally liable if it wishes. A local authority must not be debarred from having an opportunity to pursue the other person who is jointly and severally liable for the same household. In the light of the circumstances involved, local authorities must have the flexibility to make their own decisions about which avenue to take.<br><br>
I am sorry that the Opposition want to tie our hands on the whole issue and have no concern for the principle of joint and several liability. If they are against it altogether, they should say so and then we can examine it in relation to other civil debts. We should be clear about where they stand because that has implications right across the board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Minister has the vociferous support of the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes), which is always an uncertain guide to the position he should take. Characteristically, at the death, the Minister has slithered away from the point. We are not discussing the broad principles of joint and several liability. We are saying that when those principles apply and an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
obligation is imposed retrospectively on someone who had no income over the relevant period and would normally qualify for benefit, we want an assurance that that benefit will be available. The Minister has failed repeatedly to give an assurance on that; he has refused to recognise the practical experience testified to by my hon. Friends or by any Member of Parliament who does his or her job properly. Therefore, despite our earnest endeavours to persuade the Minister to take a more reasonable position, we shall have to force the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
