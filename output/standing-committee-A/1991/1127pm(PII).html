	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 198, in page 90, line 1, leave out paragraph 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment's purpose is simple: to stop information collected by local authorities for the purposes of the council tax from being sold on to others without the consent of the people involved. There are two reasons for that. First, the principle is wrong. Third parties should not be given such information without the consent of the individuals involved. The Minister may argue that paragraph 15(2)(b), which prohibits the passing on of information about a named individual, will be an adequate safeguard. It is not. In our age of high technology and computerisation, much information on individuals is already held by third parties and could be correlated with non-personal information collected for the purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a practical reason for opposing the sale of such information. Even without assuming that it is possible to correlate names with otherwise non-attachable information on property, several abuses could result from the sale of information. Owners of exempt vacant properties could be targeted by unscrupulous estate agents or rental agencies. Groups such as students could be subjected to mailing from those keen to exploit their known lack of money. Knowledge of property banding would allow quasi-income group mailing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we assume that names can be correlated to the information, the problems are worse. Owners of exempt vacant dwellings could become the unwitting victims of credit card and other frauds. Council tax defaulters could be harassed by bailiffs performing other debt collection work. Householders on benefit could be credit blacklisted. There are many other reasons why paragraph 15 is unnecessary. No benefit will accrue to local authorities from having to sell such information. It is a matter of principle and of practice. I hope that the Government accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) made the assumption that names can be correlated. That is a false assumption and his argument therefore collapses. Schedule 2 paragraph 15(2)(b) does not refer to named individuals but uses the phrase "not personal information." It specifically excludes the naming of any individual or the citing of any information about individuals. It allows the statistical information that is aggregated to be sold to companies that wish to use it. There are many reasons why a company might want such information on a particular area. Paragraph 15 protects
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
the individual. There is no way in which the aggregation of statistical information can be used in respect of named individuals. The Opposition have created a storm in a teacup without having properly read schedule 2 paragraph 15. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not expect the Minister to say much different from that. I recall that we used similar arguments when we were debating the poll tax's implications for civil liberties and I fear that the Government is as insensitive to our present arguments as they were to those. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 210, in page 93, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() No enforcement order shall be made to recover any sum under this Act unless the court is satisfied that the authority has correctly determined whether there is an outstanding claim for council tax benefit in respect of that sum'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this brief amendment is to ensure that two aspects of Government keep pace with each other. People have been charged with not paying the community charge while they have been waiting for funds to come from the social services. The amendment is designed to ensure that both parts of the mechanism work at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The citizens charter says that every citizen is entitled to expect explicit standards to be publicly and prominently displayed and that those standards should include accuracy in accordance with statutory entitlements and a commitment to prompt action. The amendment falls within that heading. The council tax benefit will play a large part in ensuring that people on low incomes do not have to pay a disproportionate amount. They should receive that contribution in time for proceedings to be halted. Anything less than that is a waste of public money, causes personal embarrassment and humiliation and must cause considerable confusion in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CAB's evidence on the community charge— surprisingly perhaps—was that many people were in the classic situation of having to deal with two Departments working at different paces. I could give many examples of two hands of Government not working together, but I know that the Minister is aware of the problem and I do not wish to take up the Committee's time. I have made my point and I hope that the Minister will be able to find a practical solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) for raising this important matter. She made her point well on behalf of the CAB. The amendment seeks to prevent a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
liability order being issued unless a claim for council tax benefit has been dealt with. I talk regularly and at length to the CAB in my constituency so I know that there are problems—there is no denying it. However, it is usual for a local authority to behave reasonably when a person's particular circumstances are explained. Unfortunately, such people do not always contact local authorities sufficiently early.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A claim for benefit has never suspended the liability of a ratepayer or a charge payer for paying any lawfully demanded sum. I appreciate the problem, but I see no reason for changing the system for the council tax. I believe that local authorities will continue to act reasonably if approached by someone with an outstanding benefit claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend has pursued the matter at some length with the CABs and I understand the reason for the amendment. I hope to discuss the concerns of the CABs with them before the next week is out, if we can arrange a suitable time and place. Their concerns are legitimate and I doubt if there is any member of the Committee who does not have a strong rapport with his or her local CAB. CABs may send our constituents to see us on some matters, and we may advise our constituents to see them on other matters. That is how it should be. In the light of my assurance that I shall discuss the matter with the CABs, I hope that my hon. Friend will agree to withdraw her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 93, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() Recovery of arrears for council tax shall be enforceable as a debt in the county court'.</p></blockquote>
This, too, is a probing amendment and may be a little more difficult to explain. It suggests that county court proceedings, as opposed to magistrates court proceedings, should be used to recover arrears of council tax. If I explain the suggestion, I believe that the Minister may see that, although this is an unusual thought, there may be merit in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object would be to transfer the enforcement procedures for the council tax from magistrates court to county courts. That has several advantages. Recovery of debt entails particular difficulties. The magistrates court deals primarily with criminal matters and matrimonial issues, whereas the county court has better developed procedures for dealing with debt and for ensuring that a realistic repayment schedule is reached. That is important, because it is ridiculous to try to enforce something that is unenforceable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Burt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that people involved in county court debt cases are often faced with not one but several debts? Repayment of the entire group of debts must be properly scheduled, and the magistrates court is much less able to take account of that than the county court would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, which is entirely accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example of the blunt-instrument approach of magistrates courts. A single woman who
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
receives £28·20 per week in income support agreed at magistrates court to pay £24·89 per week of her community charge arrears, in order not to have to go to court. That is ridiculous and would not have happened in the county court, which has more sensitivity and greater powers to look into the circumstances of the person before it. My hon. Friend raised an important point, and I am glad that he did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem involves bailiffs. In the case of the magistrates courts, the bailiffs are sent in by the local authority. In a sense the local authority has a Morton's fork approach to the person who is apparently not paying the community charge, or the council tax, as it will be. That does not seem right. The county court, however, has its own bailiffs. From an objective, judgmental point of view, it could be said that if the local authority wanted to recover its money or wanted the goods, it might be tempted to send in its bailiffs sooner than the county court might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that guidelines have apparently been laid down for the use of bailiffs to recover local government tax, but those guidelines do not specifically cover such work. The guidance is not relevant because the guidelines, which are excellent, relate solely to the payment of fines and not to the recovery of arrears of tax. The Home Office paper does not deal with the problems that we are outlining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of cases to relate to the Minister, who is aware of the problem because he kindly discussed it with me. A widow aged 65 has community charge arrears of £347 and a widow's pension of £69, and she earns £24. She offers to pay £20 a week but that is refused and the bailiffs say that they require £40 a week. Next, a notice of distress is issued to seize all her goods, except those excluded by statute. The great difficulty is that bailiffs authorised by a magistrates court are able to take goods of a very personal nature. The problem is not made any easier if someone's cooker is removed, along with personal items needed for practical everyday living. I understand that such confiscation could not occur as a result of the mechanism operated by county courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that because the county court mechanism is more sensitive, it is better equipped to arrive at a judgment that will ultimately return the money to a local authority, but with less of the hardship and clumsiness associated with the magistrates court mechanism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised issues which, quite properly, have been widely circulated to members of the Committee by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. I have received a letter from Diana Sutton, its parliamentary liaison officer, outlining her concern, especially about bailiffs, and she went into more detail than my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) had time for this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It became clear to me a year ago that bailiffs, far from being condemned by large numbers of people, should be encouraged in their proper professional role. They should continually seek to improve their professional standards and increase understanding between bailiffs—who are members of an ancient and honourable profession in this country and elsewhere—and those on whom they must serve unhappy notices and pay visits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the year, I have tried to encourage greater liaison between various bailiffs, their national organization
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
and bodies such as the IRRV and my Department. I addressed one of their conventions and am delighted by the progress they have made towards a national code of conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bailiffs are a feature of life in this country. I shall be talking to representatives of the citizens advice bureaux about their worries regarding bailiffs to see whether I can encourage them to talk directly to the bailiffs about those issues. That may help matters forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West took an interesting line when talking about county courts. I wish to explore it. Debts for local taxes, either rates or the community charge, have never been enforceable in the county courts. As my hon. Friend said, they have always been dealt with in the magistrates courts. County courts have been moving from dealing with debt to more complicated matters. To enable unpaid council tax to be recovered in the county courts would have immense resource implications for them, but another aspect is even more important. We do not want to slow down the judicial process. That could be the result if such applications were made to county courts instead of magistrates courts. I have that practical reservation about my hon. Friend's amendment, but I shall discuss that aspect with the NACAB when I meet its representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given what I hope is perceived to be a constructive reaction to my hon. Friend's amendment and in view of my intention to discuss the matter further with the NACAB, I hope that I can persuade her to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Never again, either in a Committee or on the Floor of the Chamber do we want to hear any more whingeing about Labour Members or Labour councillors not having paid their poll tax. After the former Prime Minister's daughter's performance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect your judgment, Mr. Leadbitter, and will be guided on that matter, but I am sure that in a few moments you will see the relevance of why it is inappropriate for those who live in glasshouses to throw stones; not only do they have to be pursued for the poll tax, but then they say that they have no intention of paying the costs of pursuing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want his statement to be entered into the record without a small correction. Even if one were to go along with the suggestion that the sons, daughters and other relations of hon. Members and local government councillors should be treated pari passu with such persons, the rough score is 250 councillors and six Members of Parliament versus one daughter of an hon. Member. Does the hon. Gentleman treat that as parity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Latin is beyond me, but straight politics is not. I know a good issue when I see one. The question of whether people are elected councillors, or whether they are familiar with ski-ing abroad and being counted as foreign visitors in the city of Westminster for the standard spending assessment is a good issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, seek clarification. What is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised by you, Mr. Leadbitter. In relation to the amendment, all I can say is that I do not hold the parents of elected Members who, for one reason or anoether, have not paid their poll tax to be responsible.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to think that my right hon.

We have encapsulated in the amendment the Secretary of State's bete noire at the Conservative party conference. In his speeches at that conference and in the debate on the Gracious Speech, on 6 November, he taunted the Labour party about hon. Members and councillors who would not pay the tax, as though there were hundreds of thousands of them. The Secretary of State and other Conservative Members overlooked the fact that, a year before at our conference in Blackpool, we suggested that councillors who did not pay the tax should not be able to draw their attendance allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need lectures from the Secretary of State to know that those who draw on public funds should be mindful of the people who pay into such funds. There is no need for the Labour party to apologise for wanting local authority members' allowances to be treated in the same way as other earnings or supplementary benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe—although it is not appropriate to the Bill—that that principle should apply to hon. Members, if they do not pay, evade or avoid their income tax or schedule D contributions. Last December, the National Audit Office said that £5 billion had gone missing under schedule D, because people who are applauded and supported by the Conservative party evade their tax. We are also "agin" that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that principle apply to the 30 Labour Members who signed a motion which said that they would not pay their community charge, one of whom is a member of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just made that clear; we do not have jurisdiction to legislate on that, but if we had we should be in favour of doing so. The number of Labour Members who have not paid their poll tax is not 30, or anything like it. Every Labour Member in the Committee has paid his poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many Labour Members have not paid their poll tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can we be responsible for Labour Members when Conservative Members will not accept that the former Prime Minister is responsible for her own daughter? We are a family in the Labour party, but not so close as the family in Dulwich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment is clear. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the avoidance of doubt earnings shall be denned to include local authority members' allowances."</p></blockquote>
That is what we are talking about. It is interesting to make political points and some are tolerable, but they must not become the main issue of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A combination of guilty conscience and red wine has overwhelmed the Committee, but I shall wrap up the debate. No one in the Committee will not vote for the amendment because it is fair and reasonable. This is not an issue of preventing people from voting. In speeches at the Tory party conference there was reference to something that was going to happen from April 1993, but it was made to sound as though it would happen immediately. This is an issue not of ducking responsibility,
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
but laying it on the line and saying that those who do not pay should have the moneys deducted from their income, whatever it is. We shall press the amendment to a Division, and we know that Conservative Members will vote with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an outburst from the usually calm, cool and collected hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). He seemed to get very excited, but the hon. Gentleman did protest too much methinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted when he said with absolute certainty that there were not 30 Labour Members of Parliament failing to pay the community charge, but then claimed that it was not his responsibility to know what the exact number was. Apparently, he is the Opposition spokesman with responsibility for knowing that the number is not 30, but not with responsibility for knowing the exact number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment is most interesting. I am attracted by it because there is a widespread and serious problem of non-payment. Research undertaken a few months ago revealed that about 300 Labour councillors were on the record advocating non-payment. We have no idea whether they are paying, because we cannot intrude into private matters, but if they advocate non-payment they may not be paying. If 300 is on the record, the real number of non-payers may be much greater. The problem of non-payment among Labour councillors is serious so we must consider making deductions from their allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot urge my hon. Friends to vote for a defectively drafted amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment would require employers to make deductions. In the case of an allowance, there is no employer so the amendment would not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is interesting. I should like to turn it over in my mind and I fully expect to return with an amendment at the next stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put the thought into my hon. Friend's head that Conservative Members could vote for the amendment as a symbolic gesture knowing that it can be tweaked and improved on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may need substantial amendment to make it work. At the moment we have no means of attaching anything other than earnings which come from an employer. Although it is not in my power to decide whether the Opposition should press the amendment to a vote, I cannot in all conscience recommend my hon. Friend to vote for a defectively drafted amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should take time to consider the implications of moving beyond earnings and employers. I am sympathetic to the amendment and hope that my further mature consideration of the matter will lead me to think that we should move in that direction. If that is my conclusion, I shall be happy to table an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his last few words, the Minister came close enough to agreeing to the amendment—he still thinks that the wording is defective—for us to accept his assurance that there will be unaninimity on Report, in accordance with the speech made at the Blackpool conference in 1990. I hope that the Minister will consult us. If he does not table an amendment on Report we shall be very disappointed and consider that he has misled both Conservative and Opposition Members. We look forward

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of bailiffs and poinding and warrant sales in England and, presumably, Wales and Scotland is not appropriate as a means of recovering debt. Since the introduction of the poll tax, those so-called remedies have been used increasingly as a means of enforcing arrears. I should make it clear that I am not referring to those people who can but won't pay. The Liberal Democrats have never supported such a strategy. There must be some form of sanction, such as the arrestment of wages or the attachment or arrestment of bank accounts, against those who have resources. If there are people who have plenty of money but no wages and no bank account, they must be few. To lose out on what those people owe is a small price to pay for the abolition of warrant sales, distress and sale of goods for domestic debt. The main problems have been spelled out by the CABs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady assume that everyone is on PAYE? What about the pensioner who has no bank account and no earnings? What about the self-employed person who does not receive wages from an employer and who does not have a bank account? It is wrong to assume that the only category of person who does not meet those two criteria is the one that she identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at pains to point out that most of those cases are examples of real poverty. I think that the people who really know the situation would confirm that. They find that the main problems are bailiffs seizing goods of a greater value than that required to pay the debt, bailiffs auctioning seized goods for considerably less than their value, heavy-handed and threatening behaviour— despite what the Minister said—by bailiffs executing warrants, bailiffs refusing to negotiate or accept reasonable payment arrangements and bailiffs seizing goods that do not belong to the debtor. That happens when several adults live in a property and a dispute arises about ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To quote one example of the sort of thing that can go wrong, a woman received a letter from a bailiff requesting information about the whereabouts of her neighbours, who were thought to have moved and who were being pursued for non-payment of fines. She was very worried and did not know whether she was obliged to give the information requested. In fact, her neighbours had not yet moved and the bailiffs had not taken adequate steps to contact them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly mentioned Home Office guidelines for magistrates courts on the use of bailiffs, but as he said, they are for guidance only and do not tackle many of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
issues that I raised. I am pleased that he intends to discuss them again with representatives of the citizens advice bureaux. The use of distress sales in England is an unacceptable method of recovering council tax arrears because it depends for its effectiveness on people not knowing their rights and drives the debt problem elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be some form of sanction, but let us not deceive ourselves. More often than not we are talking about real poverty caused by whatever—inability to cope with the sometimes horrendous problems of life, distressing family circumstances, or ill health. Such people need help and it is up to us, as a civilised society, to give it instead of sending in the heavies to remove and sell their goods and chattels. That is humiliating and degrading, and in Scotland it has long been regarded as a barbaric and inhumane practice. The silly part is that, more often than not, the sums realised do not meet the outstanding debt, let alone the cost of implementing the sale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to trap the hon. Lady, but does she want that option to be eliminated from any debt or does she distinguish between council tax debt and commercial debt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that worthwhile question. I should like to see warrant sales abolished. They happen in Scotland and they are despicable. They are also inefficient and humiliating. I have a lasting impression of when, as a young person, I first heard of something called a warrant sale. An Edinburgh couple who were due for one committed suicide just before the sheriff officers arrived. In those days, the goods were taken outside the house and the sale conducted there and then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was about 13 years old, a daughter of of a neighbouring family in Kirkintillock, where I was brought up, got into financial problems, unknown to her family. The family's name and address were published in the legal notices column of a newspaper, together with a time for people to go to the house. The furniture was put outside their house and that of my mother and the family's possessions were sold to strangers. Despite the daughter's distress she was restrained until all the goods were sold. Hon. Members jeer and sneer because they do not understand what happens to such families and the humiliation that it causes. I shall never forget what I saw as a 13-year-old child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand that the hon. Gentleman will always remember that incident because the incident in Edinburgh has never left my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Improvements have been made in that bailiffs no longer remove beds and cookers, but that is not enough. The principle is wrong. Will the Minister comment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was listening with interest. The hon. Lady conceded the case for an ultimate sanction for debt recovery. What is her preferred ultimate sanction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pointed out earlier what can be done with wages, salaries and bank accounts. Of course, it is best not to let people get into debt in the first place. Full take-up of rebates, accessible information on liabilities and responsibilities and discounts can help. However, realistic arrangements for repayment is the crucial issue. We should be able to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need no lessons from the Government about writing off debt, because they have written off hundreds of millions of pounds of public funds in preparation for privatisation. They lecture us about writing off debt when the poorest people in our community are being humiliated. I strongly advise members of the Committee not to take any lessons from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The Government should be reminded of the £19 billion that they have wasted on the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to move on quickly so that other hon. Members can speak, so I shall not give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to appeal to the Government, as we have appealed to them before on the Floor of the House, to abolish warrant sales in Scotland. I appeal to the Government to take the opportunity to act for Scotland and for England by abolishing warrant sales and distress sales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this is a specifically Scottish issue I am keen to speak. I was interested to hear the case put by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie), but she failed to answer the question posed in the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). In the final analysis, there must be an ultimate sanction against those who will not pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an English Member of Parliament, I confess to feeling quite jealous of the system in Scotland, which seems to work well. That system guarantees that the truly innocent person—who is owed a debt—receives his money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that many aspects of Scottish law are admired south of the border. We should not be taken in by those who spend their time wringing their hands saying "Something must be done". What do we say to the small trader who has deliberately not paid? What do we say to a trader who requires to receive payment on his outstanding bills so that he repay his debt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Lady on the take-up of rebates. She, like me, has doubtless had many constituents complaining about the community charge. But though many people have brought their poll tax problems to me, I have had very few instances—indeed, none—of complaints about warrant sales. That suggests that the local authority was reluctant to use that sanction, which is not surprising as it is a Labour authority. It also suggests that the fact that the sanction exists has persuaded many people to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady revealed that she is not living in the real world when she talked about people who live on council estates having cheque books; most of them live from week to week on their weekly pay-packet, and do not enjoy the facilities of banks. As often as not, their problems are the result of their inability to control their expenditure, and one can help them only by imposing sanity on their cash flow. Sanctions sometimes make people realise that they must do that for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember more vividly than the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) the circumstances before the second world war. A humane element has been introduced into the way in which sheriff officers work in Scotland—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh yes there has; there has been a major change in attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
I respect people with long-held honourable views, and some hon. Members have such views about warrent sales. My only difficulty, which I share with the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute, is that when the chips are down, they cannot say what the final sanction to make people pay up should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether the hon. Gentleman knows much about the Scottish scene, but I shall listen to what he says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principles are the same in England. I have stood on a family's doorstep while the bailiffs took away their last pieces of furniture. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the final sanction; if a family has no more goods to take away, how would he penalise it further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with the bleeding hearts, because they really do upset me. I have spent my life working for people who are without and depressed. They are in real trouble. They are not the scroungers; everyone who has lived on a council estate or in a tenement in Scotland knows who the scroungers are, because other people living there will name them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had first-hand experience of the situation that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) described, because my father was unemployed before the second world war, I was one of eight children and I know what real poverty is. I do not say that as a bleeding heart. I have spent my life trying to help people who are in real poverty. However, we are not discussing that in Committee; we are discussing the final sanction to be applied against those who wilfully refuse to pay debts that are due under the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, in Scotland, 64 per cent. of the poll tax is uncollected. The final sanction of the warrant sale has been in place for the past three years. It simply is not working. Thousands of sheriff warrants have been issued. There are not enough sheriff officers to carry out the poindings. Neither the time nor the manpower is available to collect that amount of debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes the case for those of us who have been campaigning to get rid of warrant sales for the recovery of domestic debt. The principle of removing it is backed up by the harsh reality in Scotland. The practice is not working, it is barbaric and it has caused enormous problems—In fact those problems have been caused by the Government and one other political party—[HON. MEMBERS: "Name it."] I shall in a moment. By imposing a 20 per cent. minimum payment of poll tax, on thousands of poor people who could not afford to pay, the Government made those people get into debt. Some of them were encouraged to go into debt by the belief, fostered by the Scottish National party, that they would not have to pay the poll tax. That party's record on non-payment warrant sales is absolutely shameful. Its members refused to participate in our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I agree that there is nothing worse than standing on the sidelines and not participating. The SNP deliberately set out to ensure that people did not pay and, when given the opportunity to serve on this Committee, it refused, unlike the hon. Gentleman and the rest of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: SNP members did not serve on the Committee that examined the Bill that introduced the poll tax Scotland—they refused a place. They did not request
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
a place on this Committee despite the fact that they could have argued for the abolition of warrant sales and supported abolition of the poll tax—for which they campaigned. The SNP ran a campaign under the banner "Can pay, won't pay" and ended by claiming in support the thousands of people who could not pay. When the Government decided to abolish poll tax and introduce the council tax, the SNP stopped its campaign. Its members reached for their cheque books and leapt to pay off their poll tax debts leaving thousands of fellow Scots in debt with no cheque books, no bank accounts and no ability to pay. It makes me extremely angry that they claim that they are people of principle who stand for the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warrant sales are a barbaric custom that should be abolished right away. Anyway, they do not work. Local authorities are now calling warrant sales for people who cannot afford the tax but who do not have goods that would make the warrant sale worthwhile in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Government did a great deal with the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 by providing that sales would not take place in houses and by removing a list of essential items from the goods that could be sold. It would have been better to abolish warrant sales altogether because they are now useless tools in the hands of collectors. They have not worked in Scotland and they will not work anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will no doubt ask, "What should replace them? What should be the final sanction?" 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland keeps referring to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) whom he described in Committee as a great and powerful figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He left that out, perhaps inadvertently, he will have to live with that description of my hon. Friend. However, warrant sales have not persuaded even my hon. Friend to pay his poll tax. Warrant sales do not work as a final sanction. It is a bit rich of the Minister to suggest that there ought to be a final sanction, having refused, as he did, the request from Lothian region for a power to enable it to identify employers, and thereby arrest earnings. As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) said,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should try to ensure that people do not get into debt. We should do as much counselling as we can, we should have advisers to persuade people not to get into debt, we can make arrangments so that payments can be made over a longer period, and we can use arrestment of wages and earnings, benefit and councillors' allowances to ensure that debt is paid. However, we should not use the barbaric lingering custom of warrant sales. The people of Scotland want to get rid of it. The Government have brought about the downfall of the warrant sale by trying to use it when the system was already collapsing. The Minister should accept that, accept my amendment and abolish warrant sales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Nevertheless, it is worth recalling what warrant sales have meant in the past. It often entailed the humiliation of family names being
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
advertised in the local paper, the arrival of sheriff officers to poind the goods with all the neighbours watching; furniture and household goods being bagged, and strangers such as second-hand furniture salesmen turning up at the house to acquire goods at knock-down prices. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), as a boy, I regularly saw that process happening, and it is an experience that will live with me for ever. I feel strongly about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Conservative Members have no knowledge of that process whatever. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) says that he has seen it. Well it beats me how anyone who witnessed it could still support its continuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty in supporting it. I grew up in a tenement where everyone knew full well who the defaulters were—those who could pay but did not. The hon. Gentleman knows that if he enters any council estate he can always find out who are the locals on the scrounge—people who are living out of beating the system. Local people know that better than anyone, and I was a local person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the hon. Gentleman's wide experience later. It remains the case that families were publicly humiliated through the degrading procedure that I mentioned. I shudder to think at the mental scars that have been left with families for generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North is right in a sense. It is a shameful thing to happen to a family in a working class area. No one ever enters the warrant sales process willy nilly. People understand the effect that it has on a family's public regard. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, it was not even cost-effective. It seldom raised enough money to repay the original debt. Furniture and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry but I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyffe) wants to get in. As I was saying, the debt was seldom covered, which shows that the motivation behind the warrant sales was not repayment but intimidation pure and simple. It was intimidation of working class people who were living in poverty and trying hard to make their way in life. The clear intention was to make an example of such people and subject them to shame and humiliation in their local area so as to make others so desperate to avoid the process that they would do almost anything to clear their debts—even if it meant sliding into further debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also true that to get rid of their debts and avoid the warrant sale, people effectively had their own sales—they took furniture and other goods and sold it to bondbrokers and dealers in the area so as to avoid public humiliation? That is what it is all about—a message of fear to working people: comply or be humiliated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend confirms my own view of the warrant sales process. Many of us have seen the desperation of families trying to avoid that process. I do not accept that anyone enters into that process lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a member of Strathclyde regional council, if people did not pay their rates—which happened rarely—consultation took place between the local councillor, members of the finance department and the people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
involved, in a concentrated effort to ensure that all alternatives were examined. We did not encourage people to avoid their responsibilities, but rather tried to ensure that they lived up to them. Those efforts worked. Strathclyde region, which covers half the population in Scotland, never had a domestic warrant sale until recently. It should be proud of that record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have never addressed the alternatives. Debt Counselling is an integral part of tackling the problem of debt. This is a working class issue. Conservative Members have no conception of the degradation and humiliation of being subjected to a warrant sale. I hesitate to say that all Conservative Members have no idea because it is tempting fate to suggest that the hon. Member for Tayside, North has not experienced something. For example, if I say that he has no experience of a sheriff s warrant or a summary warrant, he is liable to jump up and say that he spent part of his life as a part-time casual sheriff in Perth, or that he had a summer job serving warrants. The possibilities are unlimited with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until recently, warrant sales played a small part in this process. However, with the debacle of the poll tax, they are coming more and more to the fore. The pressure on sheriff officers, the police and council staff is disgraceful; nobody enjoys having to subject people to warrant sales. There is no place in a civilised society for those barbarious warrant sales. I can see no justification for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the attack on the Scottish National party by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart. People in my constituency who are being subjected to the warrant sale process were encouraged in their actions by the Scottish National party. They are now coming to me for assistance, which they will receive because Strathclyde will work out some arrangement with them. The SNP must be totally condemned for its irresponsible behaviour. Before finishing—to allow my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill to speak—let me make it quite clear that I strongly support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend and must say that I agree with his comments on the Scottish National party. Although the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) went round, most conspicuously in Glasgow, declaring his opposition to the poll tax, he was not present to vote in the Division on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government introduced the poll tax and are now changing the law, but still they refuse to abolish warrant sales. It is obvious from the responses of Conservative Members this evening that they have total disregard for the fear and distress of people facing a sheriff's notice, let alone a notice of poinding. Have elderly people in tears and shaking with nerves on receiving a sheriffs notice never come to them? Such people have no chance in Scotland to explain in court how they got into difficulty in the first place, particularly when, in some cases, they were not at fault. I know of one elderly lady who tried to pay her poll tax and had written repeatedly for a payment book, but had not received one. Problems can arise from changes in address and from simple mistakes. We are talking about people who cannot afford to pay. Those people have never been in debt in their lives and have always paid their rents on time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A way of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is a way of life for them never to get into debt, but, faced with those tax bills, they simply cannot cope. Conservative Members call such people scroungers, even though they have avoided debt all their lives. Although it is true that warrant sales can no longer take essential goods—the schedule sets out a long list of furniture that cannot be taken—not everyone knows that. We are talking about people who have kept out of debt and who are not familiar with the law. Even when a sale does take place, very little can be taken. It is often not worth the expense of recovery, yet people still have to go through much humiliation and upset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple in my constituency sold a piano that had been in the wife's family for decades. It was not worth a lot in cash but it was of sentimental value. Moreover, it was a source of much interest as, on their limited resources, it was one of the few means of amusement available to them. The couple sold the piano before a warrant sale was held in their home, and the woman, who was in tears, told me that she did not know how they were going to pay next year's poll tax. They had nothing of value left to sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another case that was reported in a newspaper, a man sold the military medals that he had won in world war two for a few pounds. I do not suppse t that that man was a follower of Tommy Sheridan and, as he lived in England, I doubt that he was a Scottish nationalist either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very few warrant sales have taken place because people will go to great lengths to avoid them. Conservative Members have asked what sanctions would be employed by the Opposition if we were in power. No doubt the Minister will say that the legislation applies to all debts, not just poll tax debts, and that there has to be some final sanction to discourage people from taking on debts that they cannot afford. I should like to point out that people used to be hanged at crossroads or sent to Botany Bay for the non-payment of debt. I live in hope that one of these days, Conservative Members will acquire a more civilised idea of how to deal with people in debt. Secondly, it is worth noting that people did not volunteer for poll tax debt. People who voted against the poll tax had it imposed on them—so much for consulting the people! The Government talk about referendums, but they do not give a toss for the feelings of the vast majority of people in Scotland, who did not want poll tax debts imposed on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other ways of dealing with debt, even debt that has been incurred through a personal decision, have been described by Opposition Members. However, in conclusion, people who are so impoverished can be helped only if the problem of scandalously high rates of interest is dealt with. The poorest of the poor pay the highest interest rates because their money goes into the hands of the back-street money lenders. Tackle that problem, and the general problem of debt will be tackled as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the last time that I will accept an assurance that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fife) will speak for only a couple of minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several things have been established in this debate. I understood that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) confirmed that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) is a non-payer. However, the Opposition appear to be in some disarray on that point. Labour Members have just made three
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
speeches attacking the present system in Scotland, which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) rightly said was set up under the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. Perhaps I can refer those hon. Members to what the hon. Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist) said when he interrupted the Prime Minister in the debate on the Queen's Speech on 31 October to ask if he would give a commitment to transfer the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 to England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill gave a reasoned speech, but she did not answer the question about an ultimate sanction. In England and Wales, an authority must issue a summons and receive a liability order from magistrates. After that, the authority has three options for recovery—attachment of earnings, deduction from income support or distress. Without a distress provision, there is no way to recover a debt from many groups of people such as the self-employed, who neither work for an employer nor receive income support. I accept that it was not the hon. Lady's objective, but in practice the amendment would create a scroungers charter for many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speeches of Opposition Members gave me a sense of déjà vu. The Opposition have been so fixated by the bogey man of warrant sales that they feel obliged to use any legislative opportunity to attack such sales. I just wish that the substance of their arguments matched the passion of their speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to prevent listing officers from carrying out estate agency work. When we were told that estate agents would do much of the valuation work for the new bands in England, Wales and Scotland, we were worried about the ethical, practical and financial difficulties that would arise. Indeed, the number of estate agents who are likely to be used is frightening. A few weeks ago 6,300 estate agents had applied to the various Government Departments and the valuation office to tender for the work involved in listing 21 million domestic properties in England and Wales. Contract packages will generally embrace between 10,000 and 20,000 domestic properties in England and between 5,000 and 20,000 domestic properties in Wales, separated into clearly defined geographical areas. Contractors will be expected to allocate all properties in a contract package, except the domestic part of composite hereditaments, to bands ranging between A and H.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
Numerous problems will be created by estate agents. The first is the problem of public confidence. When houses are valued for taxation purposes, the owners must have confidence in those who carry out the valuation. Over the years the valuation office of the Inland Revenue has done a good job in valuing properties, despite its lack of staff and resources. It will be difficult for people to give the same credibility to estate agents who make a living out of selling houses in their high streets as to a section of a Government Department. That credibility will be at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the estate agents who value properties for the Government may have a commercial interest in the properties that they value. The Government will find it increasingly difficult to balance those two factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20 requires the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue to appoint listing officers for every billing authority. The listing officer, who will be an officer of the valuation office, will be responsible under clause 20(2) for compiling and maintaining a list of domestic properties in his area. The remuneration and expenses of listing officers and those assisting them are to be paid for by money provided by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear from clause 20 whether the listing officer is to be an official of the valuation office of the Inland Revenue, and would therefore be in the service of the Crown, or an estate agent employed by the Inland Revenue. Clause 20(2) refers to the remuneration of persons assisting listing officers
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not in the service of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
That implies that statutory duties that go beyond those relating to the valuation exercise might be placed on estate agents. The Government should explain the precise relationships between civil servants and the private sector in relation to the statutory duties of listing officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised a number of issues, one of which struck me as needing to be checked out. I refer to the possibility of an estate agent having a pecuniary interest in a property that he is valuing. I look forward to the response to that point, but I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman did not table it as a separate amendment, as it seems different from the more general points that he has made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The thrusts of the amendments is to prevent listing officers from carrying out estate agency work. I agree that I have not yet touched on the matter. I made some general references to it in my introductory remarks and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) for reinforcing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that no suspicion should attach itself to any estate agent who will work for the billing authority in the capacity of valuation officer. The amendment aims to avoid there being any conflict of interest for an estate agent who might be employed to assist a listing officer. He or she would be excluded from carrying out estate agency work while doing valuation work for the billing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important point of principle. I know that the Government are in favour of the privatisation of central Government and local government services, but there comes a time when impartiality and the absence of remuneration is above and beyond every other consideration. The tax is based on the credibility of the valuation of properties within bands. If that credibility were damaged, which could happen if estate agents had a pecuniary
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
interest in the houses that they were valuing, the basis of it would be seriously affected. What precise relationship will the estate agents have with the billing authority and the valuation office of the Inland Revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be an ambiguity in clause 20(2), which refers to remuneration to persons assisting listing officers
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not in the service of the Crown".</p></blockquote>
That could imply that statutory duties will be placed on estate agents that go beyond the valuation exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee are in some difficulty in referring to one clause without referring to later clauses and anticipating later debates; we are also in danger of repeating earlier debates. However, while we are debating the remuneration of listing officers under clause 20, we should keep an eye on clauses 21, 22 and 23, which define the job that those officers will do. The officers will be party to privileged information: they will find out a great deal that could be for internal consumption, and they could have a vested interest. The position must be made clear, otherwise those who are appointed as listing officers will have a distinct advantage over other estate agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of estate agents was discussed in the House during consideration of the Financial Services Act 1986. Changes were made to the provisions for supervision of the financial services supplied by estate agents and banks and building societies were allowed to provide such services. The tied relationship between those who value properties and those who sell them were also examined. Will the extension of the role of estate agents proposed in clause 20 be reconciled with the Financial Services Act? I believe that many banks, building societies and insurance companies will want to know why the ground rules have been changed for estate agents while they cannot get in on the act, because they may not be listed agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should clarify whether the Bill grants estate agents a privileged position. It could be said that the Government are using estate agents. They propose not a proper valuation but to give bundles of between 10,000 and 20,000 properties to estate agents for valuation. That crude valuation will be carried out to slot properties into the regionally insensitive banding system. Clause 22 sets out strict time limits for compiling and maintaining the list of properties. Estate agents will be under pressure to ensure that their information is up to date. That could give them privileged access to information. Has the Minister checked the Financial Services Act to ensure that there will be no conflict between estate agents and other organisations that might wish to be involved in this activity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends are right to raise the problems of using estate agents to undertake valuations. In a previous debate, we considered bailiffs, who could best be described as bounty hunters. Estate agents could be described as Shylocks, because of the way in which they have operated for many years. I am worried about the use of estate agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have constituency experience of the way in which estate agents valuers can manipulate circumstances to the detriment of communities. They do that because of their pecuniary interest in determining prices in a local market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents have suffered problems through mining subsidence. During appeals, British Coal regularly uses local estate agents valuers to provide reports on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
perceived market value of a property, taking the agreed damage into account. Invariably estate agents try to force down the valuation of the property. Yet the same estate agents operate in the same villages, on the same estates, to value other properties more than 50 per cent. higher than the valuations that they professionally provide for British Coal, to enable British Coal to decide how much compensation to offer for damage. Estate agents are capable of ruthlessly depressing the market because they have been paid by British Coal to advise it about compensation. That reduces the pay-outs made by British Coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Estate agents' pecuniary interests cause serious problems. No vehicle exists to protect the consumer against the activities of estate agents. I was worried by a notice in the 	<i>Journal of the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation</i> of September 1991 advertising for estate agents who wished to become involved in the contracting-out process. The notice set out what was required for the tendering procedure—the approximate number of valuations to be carried out nationally, the nature of the task, the size of the package, the registration procedure, the qualification requirements and the project timescale. The notice then invited the submission of tenders. At no point did it require a declaration of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most areas, estate agents are controlled by large-scale national or regional companies that control the local market and which, between them, have a stranglehold on access to purchase and sale. In every district council those who are applying to be on the tender list are those who currently control the market price of property in those communities. The Minister of State must publicise, council by council in England, Wales and Scotland, the list of companies that have applied for tenders. That will enable people in those areas to know from an early stage who is involved in the tendering procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such action would not be a breach of confidentiality. Local authorities are rightly required to list those who apply for tenders. That is normal practice when local authority services are put out to tender. The authority must later list its decisions on the tenders. It is incumbent on the Minister to respond, because the closing date for estate agents to declare their interest and submit documents asking to be considered under the tendering process was 10 September. The Government have that information and should publish it as soon as possible so that we know who is applying to carry out the work in all the councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A declaration of interest is essential for those who will be involved in the exercise, which will be undertaken during a depression in the housing market and while the companies involved are under the necessity of maintaining some buoyancy in the housing market. That will be reflected in the way that those companies carry out the valuation. Someone who works two days a week on valuation and three days a week on selling and buying property for clients will not do anything on the Monday and Tuesday that will affect his business on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. That is not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must issue clear guidelines on how the work should be carried out and there must be a declaration of interest. Without it, the public risk being manipulated by estate agents involved in valuation. Such manipulation of the market will hit the public purse and the base of local
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
authority expenditure. The Department of the Environment will have great difficulty in calculating bandings if it leaves the task to the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marketplace will determine the bands, but it will not be a marketplace in the laissez faire sense that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) would understand. We are discussing a business, which is not controlled by a myriad of small local companies but by big players who control the property markets at local and regional level. Furthermore, we must consider the amalgamations that are taking place in an attempt to control the property market at national level. We are raising issues of principle, and we deserve an explanation from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is unwilling, at this stage, to publish the list of those who have applied for tendering work, when will it be published? If he does not intend to publish the list, will he give us detailed reasons why the information should remain privy to those involved in the exercise? Will he say why members of the public are not to be provided with such information, so that they can make value judgments about the way in which the exercise has been carried out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I approach the clause with a fresh eye and even, I must confess, with some ignorance. The provisions do not relate to Scotland and I did not, until this evening, read them thoroughly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will not intervene during my hon. Friend's speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to give any guarantees about that. My lack of knowledge about the provisions enables me to consider them in a slightly less prejudiced manner than might otherwise be the case, and to ask what they mean. I intend to compare them with the more efficient system that operates in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The listing officer will not be the person who carries out the valuations. The officer will be a person not of each local authority, but in each local authority and, presumably, will work with the local authority. What will be his job? He will not be the person who sends out the bills. Therefore, his job will be simply to sit in an office and compile a list. To be honest, an efficient secretary could do that job. I do not know why the Inland Revenue is so intent on appointing someone called a listing officer, and why we have to legislate for such an appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will be appointed listing officers? Will they be estate agents? Our amendment suggests that, if the officers are estate agents, they should not carry out estate agents' work. I would take that proposal much further and say that the individual should sever any connection that he has with any estate agent company. It is not good enough for the listing officer to say that he is no longer carrying out estate agents' work if, in fact, a fair part of his income still comes from shares in an estate agent's business. Even though he may not be directly involved in such work, he would still have an interest in that company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few months, I have become aware of how the estate agency business is no longer the business of the single estate agency office that operates in a high street. It belongs to large conglomerates; its offices are branch offices of large estate agents. Some estate agencies in Scotland are wholly owned by insurance companies,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
building societies and all sorts of organisations. That will create enormous difficulties in terms of what the Government are attempting to do in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister saying that the listing officer will be an estate agent? If so he will presumably have to be a qualified surveyor. Estate agents do not have to be. There are now some rules concerning estate agents but basically, if I could rent an office somewhere and persuade people to sell their properties through me, I could become an estate agent. It would be ludicrous then to appoint me as a listing officer or to allow me to carry out valuations for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall, as I am sure the Minister does, that when the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991 was considered on Report the Opposition tabled an amendment that would have ensured that any estate agents doing this sort of work were members of the appropriate professional bodies. The Government rejected our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I assume that when the Minister talks about listing officers and people doing valuation for the Inland Revenue he means qualified people. They will not be any estate agent who happens to have an office in the local high street. At least we hope not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a vital factor. Even if they are all qualified and members of the appropriate professional organisation, that does not ensure professional integrity when it comes to manipulating and utilising the markets to promote the interests of their company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One only has to read descriptions of houses in the average estate agent's window to see that the gap between those interests and reality is extremely wide. One can imagine the results if similar things happen with valuation. Let me quote from a Scottish assessor who, admittedly, was making a joke. He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Valuation has always been recognised as an art rather than a science. To assessors, of course, it is a science where every step and opinion can be scientifically explained, demonstrated and proved, whereas to the private surveyor art plays a much greater part and indeed some of the arguments put forward by private agents are akin to the worst types of modern art in that it is difficult to distinguish any sensible identifiable feature from the morass of confusion which surrounds it."</p></blockquote>
Conservative Members should bear that in mind when they decide whether to use private surveyors to do this work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be astonished if the regional assessors did not make that claim. In my experience the regional assessors, despite their great scientific expertise, frequently get things wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever one may say, assessors do occasionally get it wrong. But the Government must really consider whether a system of assessors, employed by the local authority, would not be a better way of handling the situation in England and Wales than having the Inland Revenue employ estate agents to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
The assessors employed by the local authorities are recognised in Scotland as being independent. One only has to see what happened with the poll tax when they were the registration officers to know that that is the case. Another assessor at the same conference at which the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and I spoke, said that he was delighted by the kind remarks that had been made by the chairman in his introduction because they were
	<br><blockquote><p>"the nicest thing that anyone has said about me since the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act, 1987 … was enacted on 15th May 1987."</p></blockquote>
The assessors carried out a difficult role in registration for the poll tax. Although they were employed and paid by the local authorities, everybody recognised their independence, to the extent that they took an enourmous amount of stick about the preofessional way in which they tried to do that difficult job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be better if each local authority, not the Inland Revenue, appointed an assessor to carry out the valuation instead of listing officers, whether or not they were estate agents. To some extent, the whole sorry mess is due to the fact that the Inland Revenue never employed enough staff in England and Wales to carry out the real revaluation of properties that should have happened between 1973 and 1989. If it had, we should not be in the mess that we are in today. In Scotland, the assessors carried out that role properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister, perhaps on clause stand part, will say whether he will consider an assessor system that would use local authority employees. They would not be involved in estate agent work and could carry out the job more efficiently and with more independence than estate agents ever could, even if the amendment is accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief point about the importance, when public money is being spent, of transparency to ensure accountability, clarity and understanding. I am a member of the Select Committee on Members' Interests. Prior to that I was a councillor. As a councillor I was subject to registrations and declarations of interest when I took decisions in my elected or appointed role, when those interests were relevant. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) mentioned a register of declarations. The Government are always repeating the mantra that we must get value for money and that money must be accounted for. That principle is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw a parallel between what was required of local government officers who appointed bailiffs to take part in the process for recovery of poll tax and what should be required of the civil servants who will appoint the listing officers. The local government officers had to declare that they had no pecuniary interest in the people whom they were recommending for appointment. The same principle should apply to those who now will supervise and make recommendations, if not the actual appointments, on listing officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. The treasurer of an Avon district authority is a consultant adviser to the bailiffs' company that has won the contract for poll tax recovery in Avon. That local government officer would have been subject to strict regulations about declaring a connection with the bailiff company, so that the members who took the decision to appoint were aware of the context of his recommendation. Similar regulations should apply to the appointment of a listing officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
Clause 20 requires the appointment of a listing officer for each billing authority. However, it is not clear whether that officer will be an official of the Inland Revenue's valuation office or an estate agent. That is important, because clause 20(2) refers to remuneration of persons assisting listing officers, whether or not they are in the service of the Crown. That implies that statutory duties might be placed on estate agents who are required to undertake valuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should explain clearly how the listing officer will be appointed, and assure us that the entire process will be subjected to the rigours of accountability to which local authority officers and elected Members of this House are subjected. The issue is about public money, and in a democracy, public perception is vital. If people, rightly or wrongly, smell a rat and suspect the motives of those who undertake valuations, the process will be substantially undermined. People will suspect the motives of estate agents in their village, town or city who act as valuation officers and who are retained by large property developers. Such property developers may or may not have an interest in the locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Streets of properties are sometimes purchased to assist a development. The Channel tunnel rail link provides an example of the purchase over a period of vast numbers of properties. If an estate agent involved in such purchase had also taken part in the valuation process, there would be cause for concern. We must avoid any hint of a conflict of interest so that the process is not undermined, and ensure that the process is open to public scrutiny. Ministers are subjected to rigorous controls in respect of their pecuniary interests when they make decisions involving public money. Those who appoint the listing officers should be subject to similar controls, and the regulations dealing with the control and publicising of the work of listing officers and supporting workers should also be clarified. Unfortunately, they are not clear in the Bill. We must press the Minister hard on this issue otherwise an inconsistency will arise in that public money will be scrutinised with different intensity, according to the speed at which the Government want Bills to go through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Declaration and a register of interests have had to be introduced for employees of the training and enterprise councils who give contracts to training agencies. Those employed in the TECs must state whether they have any connection with training agencies that apply for contracts from a TEC. The principle is clear: public money must be accountable, actions must be visible and there must be no conflict of interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the Committee by stating that a listing officer is an officer of the valuation office. He will be appointed for the purpose of compiling the list and ensuring that it is consistent and satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuation process in England and Wales is under the control of the valuation office. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The fact that it seeks the assistance of people who are not direct employees of the valuation office does not in any way alter the responsibility of that office for the final valuation. The provisions in the clause are exactly the same as those for valuation officers under section 61 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which refers to non-domestic rating. It states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall appoint— (a) a valuation officer for each charging authority, and (b) the central valuation officer.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The remuneration of, and any expenses incurred by, valuation officers in carrying out their functions under this Part (including the remuneration of expenses to persons, whether or not in the service of the Crown, employed to assist them) shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament."</p></blockquote>
There is nothing new in a provision that enables people who are not servants of the Crown to participate in a valuation, or about moneys from Parliament being provided for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall go on and it will all become clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) did not show a strong understanding of the issue when he said that the listing officer will do a task that an efficient secretary could do. The listing officer will have a much more proactive role—he will be responsible for ensuring that the list is established to his satisfaction, that it is internally consistent and that he is happy with the valuations arrived at. To assist him in that process he will have his expertise and the information available to the valuation office. He will be helped, too, because the valuation office will carry out a proportion of the valuations. We will not know what proportion until we have the results of the competitive tendering for the work. We will then know when value for money can be achieved. None the less, some valuations will be carried out by the valuation office. That will give further help to the listing officer in establishing whether he is happy with the valuations achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that explanation, I am none the wiser about the listing officers. Will they be full-time employees of the commissioners of Inland Revenue on a short or long-term basis? When they take the job, will they be full-time employees of the Inland Revenue, like any other civil servant, and have no connection with any outside company? I am aware that the commissioners of the Inland Revenue employ surveyors on a limited basis to carry out valuations. They even employ some in Scotland. Incidentally, last Saturday night I had dinner in Inverness with an old friend who happens to be one of them. Can the Minister give us more details about exactly who the listing officers are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had dealt with that in my first sentence. The listing officers are employees of the valuation office. They are direct employees who do not work for anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have thrown the hon. Member for Cathcart, as he turned to discuss an important point with one of his colleagues, when I referred to the section in the 1988 Act which is mirrored in clause 20(2) which refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The remuneration of, and any expenses incurred by, listing officers in carrying out their functions"—</p></blockquote>
but the listing officer is an employee of the Inland Revenue—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(including the remuneration and expenses of persons, whether or not in the service of the Crown, to assist them)".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the people who assist them may or may not be in the service of the Crown, but the listing officers are, indeed, in that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several points were made about transparency. I must make it clear that we shall publish the list of those firms that are successful and are appointed to do work for the

valuation office. We shall need to declare how much that will cost the Government. Moneys will be voted by Parliament for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuers will have to declare their interest to the district valuer. The appointment of valuers for the purpose will be handled by a tender evaluation board which will be called together by the valuation office to evaluate the tenders. It will include representatives from the professional societies who have been consulted throughout the pre-qualification and tendering process. They will have had an opportunity to comment on the procedures and, of course, part of the procedure is to ensure that all the firms involved pass a quality and financial viability threshold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point about the quality and viability threshold, but suppose a community has a block of 10,000 houses—in Wales, the figure may be 20,000—and the person who wins the tender is the biggest player in the local housing market. In itself, declaring an interest will do nothing in practice to resolve the problem that the person who carries out the valuation may, in reality, control that property market and thus the price levels. Will there be a threshold so that if a company had such a large proportion of the housing market it would be excluded from producing the valuation statistics for the purposes of banding in that area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the valuation office intends to impose any such condition. That is a matter for the panel that I have just mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) is right; I must answer the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may turn the issue on its head. One benefit to the public sector is the competition that will produce competitive, low-cost tenders. However, all those involved will have passed a quality threshold. In addition, that competition will enable us to employ those who have much knowledge of the local property market to value properties. In other words, we shall gain an insight into some of the accumulated knowledge in the private sector and that will be reflected in the lower price of the tender. We shall benefit enormously from the available knowledge. If we excluded from the tendering process people with local knowledge, we should be acting stupidly and denying ourselves a chance of obtaining very good value for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and then to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to have forgotten the powerful testimony that I cited in an earlier debate—I forget which one—from a chartered surveyor in Bath, whose letter contradicted the point that the Minister has just made. The chartered surveyor supported the point made by my hon. Friends, who said that jobs will not go to local surveyors with considerable local knowledge but to the branch officers of large, corporate establishments. As the Minister may recall, the chartered surveyor complained that local estate agents and surveyors are being squeezed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember the letter well. It was the only letter that opposed the views of the thousands of enthusiastic participants in the process. It is conceivable that the letter was written by a disappointed party. Although the hon. Gentleman has moved from constituency to constituency—when the electorate reject him from one constituency he moves to another—I am surprised that he has not shed the boyish naivety of believing any letter he receives from a valuer who has been disappointed in the tendering process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify the Minister's earlier statement. There are about 120,000 domestic properties in Nottingham. Am I right to assume that the commissioners of the Inland Revenue may decide, for example, to take on 20,000 properties from all parts of the city, to obtain a broad picture of what they consider to be the right values? That would give them data with which they could compare valuations from estate agents. If so, the criticism about a conflict of interests goes out of the window because the Inland Revenue will have its own basic data from 20,000 properties. Is that the Minister's argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be sure where the Inland Revenue office will make its checker-board pattern of valuations; that will depend on the tendering process. Obviously the valuation office will want value for money. If it receives attractive tenders, it may be loath to put them aside, because value for money is an important consideration. However, in every area the valuation office will have a fund of material, which will be helpful to it when it governs, as it were, the overall valuation process. Here and there it will be directly involved in valuations, which will provide a "governor" to the process. One must ensure that there is consistency in approach and in results from one area to another. However, I cannot tell my hon. Friend whether the valuation office will conduct, for example, one quarter or one half of valuations in any area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two quick points, which go back to an earlier discussion, in which I tried to intervene. The Minister mentioned that he was using a panel of experts. Is anyone from the Scottish Assessors Association on that panel? Such a representative would bring more expertise than outside estate agents or surveyors. Someone like Jack Wood, the assessor in Strathclyde, and president of the Scottish Assessors Association, should be invited to join the panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish assessors are talking about doing a full valuation of one in three properties, although they may not reach that target. Is there any chance of reaching that level under the system that the Minister seeks to establish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assessors are literally going to value one in three properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that that was their aim. They admit that they may have difficulties reaching that, but they intend to value a full third of properties. Is that the aim of the other assessors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of the valuation office is to achieve value for money. There is no set proportion of properties that the office will deal with vis-a-vis the private sector. It will want to consider beacon properties in every place—a property that is typical in a specific area. Those beacon properties will act as a "governor" of the information sent by private valuers.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
It is impossible to predict how many houses will require individual attention from one area to another. In one area many houses may fall into a specific band. Another area may have an enormous variety of properties. It may be necessary to stop and give fuller consideration to individual properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's more general point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the experts on
the panel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. The hon. Gentleman wants to force the Scottish assessors system on us all. As I said earlier, we rejoice in the diversity of our arrangements in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) said how much he valued the work of the valuation office and how successful it had been. I echo that. I am not sure why the hon. Member for Cathcart seeks to establish the superiority of the assessors and their system over that of the valuation office and its system. What evidence does he have of that superiority? I suspect that an intense national pride beats strongly in his breast —that he inherited it when he gained a Scottish seat—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might not the reason be that a revaluation of property in Scotland has been done between every five and seven years so efficiently. Appeals have been carried out and the process has gone through effectively. In England and Wales, by contrast, no valuation has taken place since 1973. Might it not be that, rather than the so-called Scottish nationalist heart to which the Minister mistakenly refers, which explains my view. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I lived in Scotland for some time before I became a Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is intended—and I hope that this assists my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South—by the valuation office that, within its allotted districts, a third of properties should be undertaken by the office itself. I do not know whether a valuation district could be as small as the city of Nottingham. Nevertheless, that is the aim within each district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield was worried about estate agents controlling the market in specific areas. I was confused by what he meant. Some estate agents may have a dominant position in providing the service of house selling in an area, but I cannot see how they can control the market. People can put their houses up for sale privately without using estate agents. The housing market is not governed by what estate agents do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the housing market is fixed by estate agents, but even if that were so, it would have no connection with what estate agents do in the valuation process. They are required, as part of the valuation process, to provide information to the listing officer who will use his expertise, the evidence of the beacon properties and the valuations by the valuation office to incorporate the information into an objective and consistent list. The opportunity for estate agents to rig the list and to drive values up or down is non-existent. The bogeyman fear of estate agents—in socialist mythology they rank alongside millionaires—is misplaced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that estate agents featured so largely in the Government's Financial Services Act 1986, when reference was made to the price-rigging that caused
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
the house price explosion in the 1980s. Building societies and insurance companies expressed concern that estate agents were pushing up house prices during the mid-1980s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see any connection between the matters covered by the Financial Services Act 1986—for example, conflicts of interest—and a process by which information is fed to the valuation office—a public sector body—which will be responsible for valuation, using its own information but with the assistance of people who know what they are talking about when valuing houses. The hon. Gentleman's point is a false one and the opportunity for conflict of interest simply does not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the Minister's exhortations that he finds it difficult ideologically to deal with the most practical aspects of protecting the public purse from the vagaries of the market place. The market place can be manipulated by dominant groups and the Minister, as a capitalist, should understand that and deal with it. The matter has nothing to do with socialism but involves an understanding of the market place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tried to fob me off by saying that he would publish the list of those who won tenders, but that is not what I asked for. I asked if he would publish the list of those in each local authority area who submitted tenders. Local authorities must produce lists of all tenderers in a public document. Why should that requirement not apply in this case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The strongest reason is that the first hurdle that potential tenderers must pass is a test of financial viability and professional competence. It would not be fair to publish a list of applicants given that some of them might be ruled out on grounds of financial viability or professional competence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is public information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no part of any tendering process for the valuation office and its tender panel to make clear its view of a company's financial viability or professional expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument is illogical. The tender procedure for regional television franchises has recently taken place and the documents covering financial viability and quality were made public. Local authorities must publish a list of those who submit tenders. That is public accountability—the right of the public to know what businesses are tendering for jobs to be financed by public funds. If there are doubts about a tenderer's financial or professional viability, the public has a right to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not how the matter is being conducted. If we had said that a list of all applicants would be published, some firms might have thought twice about applying. We shall not publish the valuation office's opinions of companies that it does not wish to accept as tenderers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are clearly misplaced—perhaps because of the misunderstanding about the listing officer. I hope that I have satisfied Opposition Members that the listing officer is a direct employee of the valuation office. In explaining his role and the way in which he would conduct it, and the information that would be available to the valuation office, I hope that I have satisfied reasonable people, at least that the valuation office will ensure that a consistent valuation list is established and that we shall be able to utilise the expertise and value for money that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
private sector offers while leaving the responsibility for establishing an internally consistent list that reflects reality in the hands of the valuation office—which, as the hon. Member for Torfaen said, does an excellent job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has answered a number of points. I must also thank him for doing what his right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General failed to do in the House this afternoon—pronounce correctly the name of my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of his answers about estate agents were as flimsy as the papers in front of him. He said that nothing new was being proposed. There is much that is new. Twenty-one million properties in England and Wales are to be assessed, largely with the help of an army of estate agents. We talk of gainers and losers from taxes. I suspect that the only real gainers from all this will be estate agents, who will look at batches of about 20,000 Welsh properties at a go. They can only look cursorily at them; any accumulated knowledge that they may have gained over years, as the Minsiter said, will be of little use to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Credibility and confidence are all-important. If the tax is to work people must have confidence in the bands into which properties are placed, and the Government will be in the deepest trouble if the valuation office is not seen to be doing the valuing. The Minister has given some reassurances, however.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"referred to in subsection 1(a) above"—	<i>[Mr. McAvoy.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 200, in page 13, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Without prejudice to their powers in subsection (1) above, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall carry out general revaluations of dwellings in England and Wales.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2B) The revaluations referred to in subsection 1 (aa) above shall be carried out by reference to such date as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has moved the amendment because I shall be absent from the Committee tomorrow. I have to attend the funeral of my father-in-law in Oxford, so I may not be able to bring the debate to an end.

The amendments raise the question of the supposed stability or permanence of the valuation exercise as well as the question of the Government's curious belief that, once the banding exercise has been undertaken, there will be no further need for regular revaluations. The Government made it clear in their consultation paper that there would be no need for regular revaluations of property under a banding system. The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities was quoted as saying—I am unsure when, but he will remember—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall invite the hon. Gentleman to repudiate them, because he is quoted as saying that once a valuation is made and a property placed in a band, that banding would last in perpetuity. I think
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
that he is saying that he never said any such thing, but as I have not heard him put on record his repudiation of those words, perhaps he would like to do so now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not remember the occasion. I certainly used the phrase "in perpetuity", but in what context? I remember saying that once certain properties were put into bands, they would remain there in perpetuity, and I still think that that is true. I remember mentioning that once low-value properties, for example, were placed in band A, they would stay there in perpetuity. High-value properties, or the castles about which the Opposition like to talk, are likely to remain in the top band in perpetuity. That is better than a non-banded system in which no properties remain at the same value in perpetuity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we just heard was not so much a repudiation as a confirmation of the Minister's view. During the debate on the amendment, we want to test the view that a property will stay in one band in perpetuity. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said in Committee that one of the great advantages of the council tax was that, because of the banding system, constant revaluations would not be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of London Authorities has commissioned the London Research Centre to carry out a study. Its consultation paper challenges the view expressed by both Ministers. The study tests whether, over the past decade—or just less than a decade—some houses have remained in the same bands relative to other houses. We need to test not whether valuations remain the same but whether they remain where they are in relation to other properties in the same or different bands. The research looked at the degree to which property prices were unstable in different regions and in different London boroughs and according to different types of property and it found conclusively that there was considerable comparative movement in every area. The research demonstrates that the Minister's confidence that revaluation would never be necessary is misplaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at variations in the movement of house prices between regions. Halifax building society provided property price data for the research. It showed that property prices since 1983 have varied considerably from one region to another. In no sense, have the movements been uniform across regions. For example, in the four years between 1983 and 1987, average house prices in London more than doubled; by contrast, average house prices in the north increased by only 22 per cent. However, between 1987 and the first quarter of 1991, average house prices in London increased by 13 per cent., but in the north they increased by over 75 per cent. Similar variations occurred in other regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, under his system of fair rates, those figures would make it difficult for capital valuations to take place? They would constantly change not only upwards but—according to the figures—downwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suppose a downward movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relative terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relative terms, the hon. Gentleman is right. That is why we proposed that there should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
regular revaluations on a comprehensive basis every five years, and annual revaluations, perhaps on a banded system, to take account of inflation and to provide a buoyant tax base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has again mentioned a banding system, can he explain how annual revaluations of a banding system will work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister will know, we say in "Fair Rates" that a banding system might be useful for that limited purpose, but we have not developed that possibility. We are clear, however, that the Government's proposed banding system for which the Minister claims the great virtue of subsistence in perpetuity, is totally useless and will create enormous anomalies over a short period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister fails to understand that, unlike him, we do not jump from one mad tax system to another tax system but consider the matter in depth, talk to experts and set up committees to examine the problem before coming up with a reasonable solution? Unlike the Government, we do not decide in April that we shall get rid of the poll tax and then come up with a Bill like this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Furthermore, Opposition Members are not prone to making silly statements about valuations lasting in perpetuity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The table of information takes as its starting point a base figure of 100 per cent. in 1983. It shows that, in London, house prices had doubled to 200.6 per cent. by 1987, whereas in the west midlands they had risen only to 136.9 per cent. By 1991, London had moved forward to 226.5 per cent., whereas the west midlands had soared to 237.5 per cent. There have been great variations over a short time in the comparative movement in house prices from one region to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We can test the same proposition by determining the band into which the average house price in each region fell and whether it moved over a period. The band for the average-priced property moved for every region over that period. The calculation used the Halifax regional house price indices to express the annual average house price for every region as a percentage of the United Kingdom average. The ratios were then categorised by reference to a council tax band. They show that, in every English region, the band for the average house changed between 1983 and 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ram the point home, it is worth looking at those movements. In the north between 1983 and 1990 the average house price moved from band B to band C as it did in Yorkshire and Humberside. In the north-west it moved from band C to band B and back to band C; in the east midlands it went from C to B to C and then to D—four movements within the period. In the west midlands, the average price moved from C to D; in East Anglia, from C to E to D; in the south-west, from C to D to E and back to D; in the south-east from D to E to F and back to E; and in Greater London from E to F and back to E.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely that blows out of the water any suggestion that any reliance or faith can be placed in the band as settling the comparative position of house prices in perpetuity or
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
even for four or five years. It is clear that a substantial revaluation is needed after five years to provide equity and accuracy as between house owners in different parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same conclusion was reached by researchers looking at house price variations in London. A similar analysis was carried out for London boroughs by calculating how average borough prices had moved in relation to the proposed bands. The average-priced property would have moved between bands in 13 out of the 32 boroughs, depending on the year in which the valuation was undertaken. The average one-bedroomed property would have varied its band in 11 of the London boroughs, while a two-bedroomed property would have moved from one band to another in 14 London boroughs in this period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can look at the analysis of the variations in house prices according to type of property, not only in terms of signifiant variations in property prices between regions and London boroughs in recent years, but in terms of major variations by property type. Between 1987 and 1991, three-bedroomed semi-detached houses have increased in price by 36 per cent. on average whereas the price of two-bedroomed purpose-built flats has increased by only 9 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research shows that the Government are barking hopelessly up the wrong tree when they try to pretend that the valuation exercise, because it has been done by banding, will somehow be valid for all time. The research shows that the banding is a snare and a delusion. Not only will it create horrendous problems when it is first done, as people object to the bands in which their property is placed but people will become increasingly restive as their property, either by type, borough or region, moves at a different pace in valuation from properties in other parts of the country or in other boroughs or from properties of a different type.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us assume that the hon. Gentleman is right and that there will be variations in one, five or 10 years. If we are establishing values as at 1 April 1991, we have simply established the tax base for that district authority. If that is all that we are seeking to achieve, why does it matter a hoot what happens three, four or five years afterwards? The tax base will have been established for the purposes thereafter of rate support grant and how much the local authority must raise. The authorities will know how many houses there are and in what bands they are placed—therefore, they will have their tax base. The variations from one year to the next thereafter seem irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand the purpose of the valuations proposed in his party's Bill. The hon. Gentleman says that the exercise will be carried out only to establish the tax base. We understand that it will also establish the asset base on which grant will be established and calculated. That in itself is worrying, because it would show that that calculation was very badly founded if it were based on such a variable and fast-moving basic factor. However, the hon. Gentleman has overlooked the fact that the purpose of the valuation exercise is to establish a distributive pattern as to who should bear what sort of burden in relation to other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that I have cited, which shows that different types of property have moved at sharply differing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
speeds in terms of their valuation, shows that a pattern established, even if it were done accurately in 1991, would be wrong, inaccurate and unfair just a few years later. I do not believe, even if the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) does, that his constituents would be happy if, for all time, as the Minister has explained, a valuation done in 1991 was the basis on which comparative liability was to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be on my feet when 12 o'clock strikes, so I conclude by saying that the Government have got it
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
badly wrong and I hope that the Minister will reconsider his confident assertion that these valuations can be allowed to remain and will be usuable in perpetuity. In the amendments we assert that regular revaluations will be needed and I hope that, even if his hon. Friends have difficulty in following the argument, the Minister will at least be prepared to accept the validity of the research and the consequences for the Government's valuation proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
