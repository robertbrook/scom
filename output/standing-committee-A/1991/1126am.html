	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [21 November],</i> No. 96, in page 6, line 22, at the end, to add the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7) A person who is liable in respect of any chargeable dwelling under subsection (3) above shall have a duty separately to notify each resident of—
	<ol>
	<li>the amount that that resident shall pay to that or any other person in respect of the council tax for that dwelling; and</li>
	<li>the amount that that resident shall pay to that or any other person in rent.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(8) At no time shall the total of the amounts, in respect of any chargeable dwelling, referred to in subsection (7)(a) above exceed the council tax due for that dwelling for that day or any other period.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(9) The amount each resident may be asked to pay shall be no more than the amount that would reasonably reflect the proportion of the dwelling occupied by that resident.'.—	<i>[Mr. Blunkett.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we concluded our sitting at 10 pm on Thursday, we were nearing the end of the debate on the right of private tenants to have shown in their bills the separate rent and council tax elements when the landlord pays the council tax on behalf of all those in the dwelling. We were debating whether that was a right for tenants or an infringement of landlords' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I understand the Opposition's argument"—</p></blockquote>
at least that was some progress—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which seems reasonable in terms of basic fairness."</p></blockquote>
For a moment I thought that we were about to win our first victory in getting the Government to accede to a sensible and reasonable amendment, but the hon. Gentleman continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everyone should have the maximum amount of information. People who, as part of their rent, pay council tax, should know how much it is but there is matter of principle: should Governments interfere and tell landlords precisely how they should make that information available?</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately, the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities picked up on the get-out clause that landlords' rights are inalienable and cannot be touched. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I pondered the question because I regarded it as fair, but I concluded that it is not reasonable to require that of landlords."</p></blockquote>
"That" means giving tenants information, which the Opposition regard as a basic right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was typical of Labour Members that they should want to intervene in relations between landlord and tenant and their proposal is rather naive."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
It is neither interfering nor naive.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rent charged in such places will be what the market can bear and, ultimately, regardless of whether the tax element is shown separately or not, it is unlikely to make any difference to the amount of rent that is being charged."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 21 November 1991; c. 347–350.]</p></blockquote>
That is an extremely cynical view to take when dealing with private tenants' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords retained £400 million—possibly more—in rent when rates were abolished. We are now moving from the poll tax back into a property tax and we wish to protect tenants from being ripped off again. We want them to know exactly what the rent is and what the council tax element is in the total amount that they are required to pay. As we pointed out on Thursday, that is not unreasonable. The Government specify how local authorities should present that information to those who now pay poll tax and to those who will pay the new council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said that we agreed with the Government that council tenants and public landlords should have a relationship in which they understand exactly what is being charged and what the council tax element should be. We expect no more and no less for private tenants. We do not believe that private landlords should be shielded from the rights of tenants to have information or from ensuring that tenants are not discriminated against, so that the amounts raised do not exceed the actual rent in council tax imposed on such tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall divide the Committee on the amendment, which we think is fair. No arguments have been made that invalidate the rights of private tenants or the purpose of the amendment. Conservative Members who vote against it will rue the day when they denied tenants the rights that the Government are continually parading in other sections of the community, the rights that I should expect to be built into any citizens charter—the right to know, the right to see at a glance what is council tax and what is rent and the right of the public purse not to pay out more than is necessary for whatever benefit entitlement is received by tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 126, like clause 11 itself, takes us to the heart of the question of discounts and to what the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has referred to as the combination of a personal and a property tax. Opposition Members consider that it could be described equally well as a combination of a head tax and a roof tax. It is the combination of a personal discount and the element of a head tax that leads to the most fearful complications, and it is the cause of many of the problems with which the Government are wrestling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be said that the Government have not been warned. We in the Opposition have done our best to warn the Government that they are dicing with death, as it were, but so have many other voices from the world of local government. The Audit Commission has expressed reservations, the 	<i>Local Government Chronicle</i> has urged that the whole crazy notion be dropped, and even the citizens advice bureaux have expressed, through briefings issued to the Committee, their great anxiety about this aspect of the new tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is remarkable that neither on Second Reading nor so far in the Committee's proceedings have we heard Ministers argue convincingly for the inclusion of these provisions in the Bill. That is partly because Ministers are unwilling to bring to the surface the underlying arguments. As a result, we hear arguments that lack both conviction and credibility because they are not the real arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first possible argument in favour of discounts is that they would be a way of relieving people, on income grounds, from a liability that they would otherwise have. That argument clearly does not hold water, and, to be fair, Ministers have not advanced it. Indeed, they have glorified in the proposition that discounts have nothing to do with income or the ability to pay. Ministers brush evidence of unfairness aside, saying that discounts have nothing to do with fairness or ability to pay. As we shall argue on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
another group of amendments, even if the Government could be persuaded to consider ability to pay, it is clear that the discount system is not the right method of dealing with the problem. We believe that the rebate system is a more accurate, better targeted way of helping people who find it difficult to pay their bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument has already been advanced: the discount system is proposed to take account of the fact that a single-person household will make fewer demands on local government services than a two-person household. One or two Conservative Members are puzzled by the argument. I am too. However, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland advanced that bizarre argument strongly. Even if we take it seriously as a genuine attempt to compare the demands on the local authority of one family with those of another, the discount system would be the crudest possible attempt to nod to that principle. It would certainly not measure such demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) pointed out that pensioner couples often make fewer demands on a local authority than a single parent with four children. The discount system is an extremely crude measure. It would not even put into effect the principle that people should be assessed according to their demands on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Measuring demand is in any case an odd basis for a council tax. We have never imposed direct taxation on the principle of a contract between the taxpayer and the state or local authority. Income taxpayers do not pay tax according to their varying demands for nuclear weapons or miles of motorway. That would be nonsense. People pay income tax according to their income and their ability to meet that tax obligation. It would be almost unprecedented to claim that, for the council tax, a notional contract existed between the individual taxpayer and the local authority. That reflects not a serious principle of taxation, but a residual, almost primeval loyalty to the market. The Under-Secretary of State thus reveals that he is no great pioneer of tax theory, but a backwoodsman who cannot conceal his abiding adherence to the principle that no transaction is valid unless the market has sanctioned it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will abide by his principle. Ministers believe that, somehow, even the tax relationship is negotiable. If, therefore I, as a council tax payer, could show that I had reduced my demands on the local authority, I could, logically, demand a reduction in my bill. That is wrong. Even if that was seriously advanced as a basis for the tax, the discount system would be a curious interpretation and a rudimentary, ineffectual reflection of the principle behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart pointed out, the distinction between the demands of one and two-person households is unclear. What about three, four and five-person households? If the principle is so dominant and drives the Government to create such problems; if it accounts for the confusion and complexity of the discount system, why stop at one and two-person households? Why not make a distinction between one and three or four or five-person households?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister nods. But he does not attempt to make such a distinction because he knows that it would be administratively complex. We are already in danger of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
collapsing under the weight of problems posed by the discount system. Those problems would multiply if the principle were followed through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would agree that if a tax is based on a combination of property and the people who live in it, it would be sensible to base a discount system on the same combination. No one—not even the hon. Gentleman—has suggested that children should be taxed. The cost of living for a single mother, who could be a widow or deserted, is high. The tax system should recognise that. If the children are not included in the system, the mother will use fewer services, such as refuse collection, bus passes and libraries, than a couple. It is reasonable to take account of the ability to pay, the costs of running the house and the number of people who live in it. The discount system does that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by what the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) has said. I have laboured to show that a hopeless confusion exists, not only in the proposed system, but in the minds of its supporters. The hon. Gentleman has demonstrated in 60 seconds the sort of confusion that I have worked hard to establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea claimed that the discount system was justified because the poor single mother would be unable to pay the council tax. The hon. Gentleman is right. That is why the Opposition believe that any system to help such a person should be based on an income-related rebate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not dispute that he said that the discount system was justified because the poor single mother would be unable to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes it is. When the hon. Gentleman reads 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that he used the phrase "ability to pay". The rebate system is the right way to help people who cannot pay the council tax. The hon. Gentleman's claim that the council tax has to do with ability to pay has been comprehensively squashed by Ministers, who would claim that the discount system is not to be justified by ability to pay. The unfairness would otherwise be intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea attempted to defend the scheme on the basis of a second criterion: numbers and demands on services. He argued that a single mother with four children would make fewer demands than a couple. My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart showed conclusively that no hard and fast rule could be set out. If head count is so important, why does the proposal stop at one and two-person households? Why does the hon. Member for Battersea consider it irrelevant that a household could contain three, four or five people, who all made demands and were eligible for a head tax? Why not take the principle to its logical conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to correct what he implied that I said, but which I did not say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I excluded children. I made the generous assumption that not even the hon. Gentleman would wish to tax children. I took the single adult household as the unit likely to cost less for community services used. Such a household could comprise a single person living alone or a single adult with children. To that extent the charge is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
related to the cost of community services to that household. However, I did not say a "poor single person", although I did refer to the ability to pay. Poverty would be catered for by the rebate system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the single person's costs, I suggest that a single mother would have additional costs—irrespective of the size of the house—which it would be reasonable to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman argued that everyone else should pay, too. That is what the community charge effected, and I understand that it has been dropped because it was difficult to collect and because people are likely to pay a contribution through general taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The length of that intervention shows the mess that the hon. Gentleman had got into. I am content to allow 	<i>Hansard</i> to be the judge of whether the hon. Gentleman put his foot in it. I suspect that the record will show that he did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent we have already dealt with my third argument. The discount is, and remains, at least in part, a head tax; but if it is, why not have the courage to carry that principle through and have a head tax for every adult, as the Government did with the poll tax? Why should the difference only between one and two heads count? A total illogicality underlies that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have got into a mess. Ministers and Back Benchers offer different explanations—none of them convincing—of why we are to have the system, but the real reason cannot be brought to light. It is that those who drafted the provision came up with this wheeze, not because they thought that it was administratively sensible or because it reflected a certain principle, but because they wanted to create an illusion that somehow the tax was still a poll tax—the obvious limitations on that principle notwithstanding—to attract the support of the diehard supporters of the poll tax. However, they did not realise that those die-hard supporters were cowards, like the rest of them. They ran away at the first shot. As soon as it became clear that the poll tax was to go, all who had sworn to fight to the death, to man the barricades and to put up a tremendous rearguard action simply abandoned the battlefield. The hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) and the Minister, who only 14 months ago said that the poll tax would be a vote winner and urged the Tory conference to support it, have now melted away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exercise of trying to incorporate into the council tax something that looked tolerably like the poll tax has turned out to be useless and unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I remember rightly from what I read in our local paper, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland once said that a property tax would be imposed on his constituents in Eastwood over his dead body.

We now have a tight switch that incorporates a poll tax, but it has turned out to be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another, related, reason for the head tax element is that so many Conservative Members opposed the rates or any form of property-based tax. Consequently, when the Government finally bit the bullet and introduced a property-based tax, they had to differentiate it from the rates. That is why we have this nonsensical superstructure of discounts.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the head tax element is totally ineffective to fulfil its true function, which is to allay fears in the Tory party and pretend that the council tax is not a property-based tax, it does just enough to cause real confusion and administrative difficulty. It is just enough of a head tax to make it necessary for a local authority to know before it can accurately issue a bill how many people live in a household. Lest anyone should think that that is a relatively minor undertaking, let us remind ourselves of some reasons why the Audit Commission and others have been so worried by the proposal. It is the scale of the exercise—quite apart from the principles involved—that is so daunting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 7 million single person households: that is 33 per cent. of the total. According to the Audit Commission, that proportion rises in inner city areas to 40 per cent., and in some London boroughs 50 per cent. of households could be single-person households. But that is not the end of the problem, because it is precisely those single-person households that are the mobile and transient part of the population. The Audit Commission found that the number of moves that people make is far greater than has been appreciated. In inner-city areas—particularly in London—it could involve 50 to 60 per cent. of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount proposal will require local authorities, before they can bill accurately, to know where these millions of single-person households are and then to trace them as they move around. To show that it is not only the Labour party, or local government, that is making that up, I shall bring to the Committee's attention the briefing from NACAB:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence…makes it clear that there are substantial numbers of people whose lives are not neatly predictable, who move about frequently and are unable to fit their lives into the requirements into a workable register.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The fact that…the community charge is…on a daily basis further compounds the problems of operating a discount system."</p></blockquote>
In its briefing NACAB continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A CAB in Greater Manchester reports a client who had six changes of income status and three moves of address (all different local authorities) in ten months. For three months the client was a full time student living in local authority A paying 20 per cent. of the community charge. Then the client moved to local authority B, had a part-time job and claimed community charge benefit (CCB). Then she claimed income support and was once again paying 20 per cent. of the community charge. Following this she had two months on a fluctuating income (not on income support) and in receipt of CCB. This was followed by a return to her parental home in local authority C where she claimed income support and was responsible for 20 per cent. community charge to this third local authority. She then returned to local authority A to become a full time post-graduate student and became liable to 20 per cent. of community charge on grounds of her student status."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
That is not an unusual case, yet all those changes will matter because of this crazy addition of the personal discount system to what should be simple property-based tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NACAB points out that, under the poll tax, when it became clear that a personal liability was to be applied for lodgers and that landlords would lose their discount, landlords began to evict their tenants. The impact of a single-person discount will result in similar pressure on tenants when landlords will lose their discount if the existence of the tenant becomes known. A client of an East Sussex citizens advice bureau was a lodger in a private home. The landlady did not declare him when she registered for the community charge. Despite the advice of the landlord, the client registered and was then given 28 days' notice to quit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving out the items the hon. Gentleman mentioned that relate to the community charge—they have nothing to do with the Bill—we are talking about single-person homes whose occupant moves house during a year. That presents a difficulty under whatever system is introduced, including the rating system to which the hon. Gentleman wants to return. So I do not see the problem there. As for councils having to trace people, surely, if a household is deemed to be a two-person household unless a single person claims, it is up to the single person to make that claim—so the onus is on, not the council, but the single person. That means the end of bureaucracy and the start of individual responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman offers his solution to the problem with tremendous confidence. I shall ask in a moment whether that confidence is shared by Ministers, but first I must point out that the question being posed is complicated, not just by single people moving from one household to another and the obligation of the local authority to know whether they are single people, but by the fact that their status discount will change as well. The example that I gave is particularly relevant to the council tax paid by the individual involved and to the council tax paid by the households which he or she joins and leaves at various times throughout the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Battersea does not disagree that this structure is very complicated. As people join and leave households, the liability of each person in those households could change. The local authority will be obliged to know what those changes might be. The hon. Gentleman said that there will be no problem because it will be up to individuals to claim the discount; and if they do not, that is too bad. I wonder whether Ministers agree with that. I noticed that the hon. Member for Eastwood turned to nod to him, as if to say, "That's a good boy; you've got it exactly right." Schedule 2 does not specify that in all circumstances the local authority should send out bills as though to standard households and then sit back to wait for claims from single-person households. Schedule 2 permits regulations to be made that impose on local authorities the obligation to use information in their possession, or to seek information, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the matter is not as simple as the hon. Gentleman or the hon. Member for Eastwood, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, would have us believe. It is not clear from the Bill what local authorities will be required to do. Must they simply send out bills at one go and wait for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
applications to be made, or do they make an attempt to calculate the bill in advance and so have to change the calculation as the position changes or wait for notification?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also not clear what local authorities must do when an application is made and facts have to be confirmed. What are their obligations? Ministers have made some suggestions, such as canvassing, which I assume means that council officials should turn up at premises, knock on the door, demand entry, look around to see who is living there and check on their occupations. Most people would recognise that as the snooping function which, traditionally and unpleasantly, has been carried out by the Department of Social Security. That is what I understand by "canvassing". If that word has another meaning, I should be grateful to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also told that the local authority would have references to other sources of data—specifically, the electoral register. That confirms one of our worst fears. The great objection to the poll tax was that people would be deterred from being enrolled on the electoral register. The Government at least considered that that objection had been deflected by the assurance that a separate, poll tax register would be kept and that that register would be quite different from the electoral register. The argument was that there would be no inhibition on civil rights. In the event, that argument did not work because a million votes disappeared off the electoral register. However, Ministers are now saying openly that a separate register will not be necessary, as local authorities will be encouraged to consult the electoral register. You can bet your life, Mr. Leadbitter, that it will result in the already considerable incentive to trade votes to escape tax liability greatly increasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason for omitting one's name from the electoral register would be to defraud the town hall by implying that only one person lives in what is really a two-person household. Surely the hon. Gentleman is not advocating that a system that combats fraud should be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman would straighten out his thinking. Of course I do not advocate fraud or any such thing. My point is simply that an obvious consequence of the poll tax was that a million names dropped off the electoral register, even though the community charge registration officer was not entitled to look at the electoral register but was required to keep a separate register. However, Ministers are pleased to tell us now that there will be no separate register and that the relevant officer will check the electoral register to find out who lives where.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any attempt to avoid tax liability is a bad thing, but it is a demonstrable fact in the real world in which we live that even in the constituency of the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis)—who thinks so little of his constituents that he is not worried about this problem— people misguidedly, wrongly and perhaps ineffectually try to avoid tax liability by keeping their names off the electoral register. I should be astonished if the hon. Gentleman disputed that that has already happened, or that it is likely to happen again under the even greater spur of the present proposals, which mean that the electoral register would be the primary source of information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unworthy of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that I do not care for those of my constituents who are in difficulty. That is nonsense. I care for those of my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
constituents who are having to pick up the bill on behalf of people who refused to pay when they were able to do so. The electoral register will help local authorities put the finger on people who are trying to cheat their neighbours and fellow council tax payers, and I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would consider that a worthwhile function for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman bears out my contention that his concern for his constituents is selective. He is more worried about the people who pay their bills than about those who, wrongly and misguidedly, believe that they can escape payment by selling their vote. That is very worrying. There is no point in Ministers or Conservative Members refusing to accept that that is a consequence of the tax system that they have created. Moreover, it will be even more likely to happen under the council tax system than it was under the poll tax. I fear that it is the inevitable consequence of Ministers' advice to local authorities to refer to the electoral register when checking whether a residence is a one or two-person household. That is what he said, and it is on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Dawn Primarolo	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The exchange that has just taken place between my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) makes the case for a register of people liable to pay the council tax. The Government have refused to establish such a register and wish to conceal the fact that they will use the electoral roll to identify registered payers. That is an inappropriate function for the electoral register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. We do not like the notion of a register at all, but, given the choice between a properly constructed register for a particular purpose and the use of the electoral register in these circumstances, we would choose the former. I hope that the Government will have the honesty to admit that that is the choice. They should admit that in reality many local authorities will need a database to help them wrestle with a great deal of information the fluctuates on a daily basis. It does not matter whether it is called a list or a register. If the Government would only admit that that is the case and tell local authorities not to refer to the electoral register, we should feel, if not happy, then at least that we have made a slight gain and reduced the obstacle to civil and political rights that the Bill represents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that people's names go on the electoral register for the purpose of voting? That is very important, and the Data Protection Act 1988 makes it clear that lists should be relevant to a particular purpose. However, people fear that the information that they provide for such a register will be used for other purposes, such as the collection of the poll tax or the council tax. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that a voting register is used only for the purposes of voting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. That is what I want Ministers to accept, but they are so confused about the matter that they cannot make up their minds whether it is more important to deny a need for a council tax register and to rely on the electoral register than to say that there are no civil liberties implications and that local authorities will muddle through somehow by referring to various other sources of information.

My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) is right also to say that citizens need to be assured that the information that they register in order to vote will be used for that purpose alone. The consequences that will flow from using that information to apply a tax will be inevitable. I wish that Ministers would face up to that simple proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, if Conservative Members agree—as I do not—that the electoral register should be used as an index in the collection of council tax, we can expect the Government to introduce legislation to use the register in the collection of income tax. Unfortunately, many people who vote are able to avoid massive amounts of income tax. The fact that we have not heard that proposal from the Government shows the selectiveness of their approach to the use of the electoral register and shows that they are aware of the dangers which my hon. Friend pointed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right again. If Ministers are prepared to breach this principle—I hope that they are not—we are at least entitled to hear how far they are willing to extend that breach. For what other purposes would they consider it legitimate to refer to the electoral register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an income tax investigator who seeks people who are not paying the income tax that they should pay cannot find them through the usual channels at the work place—perhaps because those people are self-employed—it is reasonable for him to resort to a local register, to the small advertisements in a newsagent's window or to whatever other avenue is open to him. But we are not talking about income tax. We are talking about council tax. The electoral register is a register of local residents that is used for voting purposes, but it is surely reasonable—as a way of guarding against fraud and protecting the community as a whole—for a claim for a single household to be checked against the electoral register. If two names are found for the same address, it will then be possible to ask the householder who the second person is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman see that, apart from the important principle involved, the electoral register is a snapshot of a household at a particular moment, whereas liability under the council tax will vary from one day to the next? It could be different on each of 365 days, except during leap years, when it will be different on each of 366 days. That is why it is not just wrong in principle to use the electoral register for that purpose; the instrument itself is uncertain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) is saying is interesting. He is saying that the Inland Revenue can use the poll tax and electoral register to discover information about the non-payment of income tax. However, the Minister refuses local authorities the right to information on Inland Revenue records to arrest people's wages, which forces them to poind goods, to subject people to warrant sales and even send people to prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will doubtless want to deal with that when he winds up, if he can find his way through the many other points with which he must also deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to keep tabs, unnecessarily, on all these people for a futile political objective, local authorities will be canvassing and snooping, inhibiting civil liberties by referring to the electoral register and, according to the Minister and even more bizarrely, going into aerial photography. That is cloud-cuckoo-land. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am glad that the Minister has arrived to take his customary bow at this point because we are much entertained by such a thought. Given the obligation that this ridiculous system will impose on local authorities, how will they establish the facts on a day-by-day basis? We do not have an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious not just about the administrative difficulty, but about the costs of this crazy arrangement. At this point I am not even referring to the administrative costs, which will be huge. Local authorities are correctly worried about what allowance they will be given for the administrative costs of trying to run an essentially unworkable discount system. I am talking about the costs that represent the savings that some people will make at the expense of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider once again how many properties might be affected. One third—7 million—of households are single-person households. Only 50 per cent. of the bill will be paid on who knows how many second homes. We cannot possibly know how many households will be affected by status discounts. Taking all those factors into account, I understand that the Government have come forward with a figure of about £780 million as the amount that the discount system will save those who will benefit from it. The Government are certain to go out and say to the public, "Look at this—isn't it wonderful? We are saving you all this lovely money. This is money that you would otherwise have to pay." What they will omit to say, or perhaps what they do not even understand—although we shall certainly ensure that the British public understands it—is that that £780 million has to be raised from somewhere. It will be raised from all the higher bills paid by those—the majority—who do not get the discount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) is not present this morning, but for those who continue to be puzzled by why council tax bills for average families will be so much higher than they should be, here is yet another reason. Those families will be paying the £780 million which discounted people will have enjoyed. The peculiarity of that—which takes me back to the misguided point of the hon. Member for Battersea about ability to pay—is that that £780 million is not being awarded to people because it bears any relation to their ability to pay. A single millionaire will get help when a low income family will not. Under the proposals, that millionaire living in a £119,000 house in England will pay a bill of £367 whereas a low income family living in an £88,000 house in the same area will pay £490. Where is the fairness in that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An oddity characteristic of the poll tax and all the principles that have underpinned the Government's approach to local government finance is that the bigger a bill, the bigger the discount and the better off one is, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
more help one will get. Someone who lives in a £29,000 house in Wales will get a discount of £27·25 or 52p a week. However, a single person living in a £330,000 house in London will get a discount of £200 or £3·85 a week. Where is the fairness in that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If money is to be spent in trying to alleviate the difficulties that some people may encounter in paying the bills, why not direct it at those who need help? Another oddity is that those at the bottom of the income scale will get no help from the discount system. People on 100 per cent. rebates, as with the £140 reduction which was brought in a year ago, will get nothing under the discount scheme. The set-up is crazy and makes no sense from any viewpoint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government's proposal to give all single householders a 25 per cent. discount on their council tax, whatever their income, shows that, like the Bourbons of France, the Government have forgotten nothing and learnt nothing.

The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will probably give the same smug, arrogant assurances that the Government gave about the poll tax.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that, when everyone was obliged to pay at least 20 per cent. of the community charge, pensions and benefits were increased by 20 per cent. of the average community charge? It is unreasonable and unfair to imply that we imposed that obligation to pay 20 per cent. on everyone, without recognising that benefits and pensions were increased correspondingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the case. Benefits and pensions were increased once, by a notional average. The increases went ahead before poll tax levels were set in Scotland, let alone in England and Wales. They were based on figures that were later proved to be nonsense in terms of the levels of poll tax imposed, and they were not increased again to take account of further increases in the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Government are going to abolish the 20 per cent. altogether for the council tax, can we assume that they will reduce benefits, to take account of the fact that people on benefit will no longer pay the 20 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but that is the natural conclusion that we can draw from what the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) just said. He does not understand the system that operated or its basic unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount that the Government are giving is unfair, in much the same way as the poll tax was unfair. It is to be given to everyone who lives alone, regardless of income, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said. The millionaire living alone in his mansion or his penthouse suite will get the discount, whereas a couple of pensioners with a small extra pension will have to pay the full amount of the tax and will not get a rebate. Not only will the millionaire get the discount but, as my hon. Friend pointed out, the pensioner couple will have to pay for that discount, because the scheme is to be financed within the council tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what makes a discount system different from a rebate system. When a rebate is given, central Government pay the benefit to the local authority for the person in question, so it does not fall as a burden on the other taxpayers in the local authority area. This scheme means that the burden of the discount—the 25 per cent. given to a person with wealth—falls on the rest of the council tax payers in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows full well that his argument has no intellectual integrity. He knows that the amount of revenue received by local government in Scotland that comes from the taxpayer is 89 per cent. Only 11 per cent. is raised locally. When one takes into account what the millionaire to whom the hon. Gentleman referred is paying in both direct and probably in indirect taxation, he is making a much larger contribution to the funding of local government than the pensioner in the hon. Gentleman's comparison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that, but I wish that the hon. Gentleman would stop perpetuating the myth that only 11 per cent. of local council taxes is raised locally and the rest is given by central Government. Although central Government now control 89 per cent. of all local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
government revenues, the non-domestic rate is still raised locally but is controlled by central Government. The local authority it able to raise only 11 per cent. of its money, but it is wrong to overlook the fact that the non-domestic rate is levied on local businesses in a particular area. I wish that hon. Members would get that into their heads, otherwise the argument is intellectually dishonest, as the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) tried to suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock makes an important point about income. Income plays no part in the Government's crazy scheme. A single person may have a higher income than the couple living next door, because one partner may be working and the other may be looking after the children at home, yet the single person gets a 25 per cent. discount and the single-earner household gets no discount at all. No account is taken of the fact that there may be only a single earner in a household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that we shall hear a great deal from Conservative Members about the widow, living alone in a large house, who will be faced with large local tax bills. They will probably also use the arguments about a single person who has to pay the same amount as the four or five working adults who live next door, or about how single householders use fewer public services than larger households. I notice that I have written "lager households" in my notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only argument that would stand up to examination is the first. I accept that, in the past, some widows were outside the rebate system and had difficulties in paying their rates, but, of the number of widows living alone, such people were a small proportion. The majority of pensioners living alone were entitled to rebates under the rebate system. Others—perhaps a smaller number—had incomes that enabled them comfortably to pay their rates, and there was no reason why they should not have paid them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot devise a tax system for all the people that is designed specifically to deal with the problem that affects a small proportion of the population. We must devise a system and then find the means of dealing with the minority of people who will be adversely affected by it. To devise a system the other way round is nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot argue that a single person should pay less than the family comprising several working adults which lives next door, yet at the same time argue, as the hon. Member for Thurrock has, that the single millionaire should be entitled to a discount because he pays more money to local government services through his income tax than, say, a pensioner couple. If that is true about the millionaire, that is equally true of the four or five adults living next door to the widow who lives alone. That argument does not stand up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman conveniently forgets that the four or five adults who are living in the house next door are probably using four or five times more services than the single millionaire or single pensioner living alone. He is completely incapable of appreciating the whole point of my argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. Presumably four working adults in a household would not be using the education system because they are in work. They may create marginally more rubbish, but it is not necessarily true that they may create more refuse for collection. I have a family of five, and our refuse is put into a wheelie bin each week, as is the refuse of the couple who live up the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
road. The local authorities still have to collect the rubbish from the wheelie bins, whether it has come from a family of five or a single householder. The argument of Conservative Members is nonsensical. If they become involved in a dispute about the use of services, they will get into a tangle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall come back to that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) dealt effectively with the argument that we must not base a tax system on services that are paid for by that tax. We do not devise such a system for any other tax. Let us consider another tax system that was devised originally for a specific purpose—the car tax. It was introduced by Lloyd George in his Budget in 1910 or 1911. He specifically stated that that revenue, to be raised from car users, was to be used to maintain and improve the road system in Britain. Car users would pay the tax and it would be used specifically for motorists. No Government since then, including that of Lloyd George, have used the tax for that purpose. It is collected, it goes into a general tax pool and it is spent in a variety of ways. Motorists may wish that it were used entirely to improve roads, because that would mean many more road developments, while others may argue that that would be a bad thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great difficulty following the hon. Gentleman's logic. Is he arguing that people should be taxed according to their ability to pay? Surely four adults living in a house are able to pay. The hon. Gentleman constantly argues about ability to pay; he therefore defeats his own argument in citing such a case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am defeating the Government's argument for giving a discount to millionaires living alone because they will pay more through their income tax. That argument also applies to four working adults living next door to a single-person household, if the hon. Gentleman can understand that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 12 years, the hon. Gentleman and I have faced each other across the Chamber and Committee Rooms. He has always had great difficulty in understanding my logic and that of anyone else. That says more about him than it does about me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the example of the car tax. How much more should a millionaire pay for his car tax than other people? At present, a millionaire pays £100, like everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He probably has more than one car. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham and other Labour Members, including me, have argued that there is a principle that we do not raise taxes for the use of specific services. Indeed, the Government do not insist that, having raised money, local authorities shall spend it in a certain way—far from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the National Health Service and Community Care Bill Committee, Labour Members argued strongly that local authorities should ring-fence their expenditure on community care and set aside money to provide that service. The Government said no, that could not be done. Why, then, is it argued that 11 or 15 per cent. should be ring-fenced and related specifically to the services provided by the local authority? It cannot be done on the basis of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
principle. It cannot be argued that taxes should be raised for services provided, because we do not, and should not, raise taxes in that way. Even in relation to hard cases, the argument does not bear close examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham repeated what I said: a single parent in work—not in the rebate system—with four children at school is likely to use more of the local services than the healthy pensioner couple next door. A discount system should not be based on such a ludicrous idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman would not argue that two adults should pay one admission price at the local council-run swimming pool. For many services, the number of people in a household makes a difference. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will respond to the point that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) did not answer. Two people will make more use of a library than one, two pensioners with bus passes will make more use of buses than one and two people will create twice as much refuse as one. The hon. Gentleman says that his pensioners and working adults would not use the education service, but it is there for them to use. Even if every adult in a household does not use the service, it must be provided. There is a notional cost even if people do not use the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman had to drag around to find examples. I could stand here all morning and give examples the other way round—I assure my hon. Friends that I do not intend to do so—proving that it is crazy to try to raise taxes on the basis of services provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as possible, taxes must be raised on the basis of people's income in a system that makes them easily collectable. We should not establish a scheme in which single people receive a 25 per cent. discount. Raising taxes that way does not work. If one had four children at school, one would hope that they would all use the library. That would mean that five people in the household would be using it and only one would receive a discount. The hon. Gentleman's argument is nonsensical and does not stand up to close examination. I hope that we have now disposed of it and that Conservative Members will not use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems of administration will occur. The banding system is unfair because the poor are paying for the rich at the top end of the scale. The Opposition do not consider it an especially good system although it is workable. The discount scheme has all the worst aspects of the poll tax. It is unfair and unworkable and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham said, it is probably undemocratic. Local authorities will not be able to keep track of the number of single households in their area. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation proposed amendments that would entail setting up registers in every local authority area. I was unwilling to introduce such amendments because we do not want a return to the register system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland knows full well the number of changes that have taken place in Strathclyde and Scotland under the poll tax system. Every year there have been more than a million changes in the register. Local authorities cannot keep track of where people are and what they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax is to be collected on a daily basis. If a person works on the oil rigs and throughout the year spends two weeks in his house and two weeks away, will the house be considered a single-person household when his wife is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

there on her own? Youngsters move from house to house. Two unemployed people may live together and one may move out, creating a single-person household again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complications of the discount system are legion. It will create the same administrative nightmare as was created by the poll tax. I do not believe that Conservative Members honestly believe that it will work. If by some increasingly remote mischance the Government were to win the general election, I believe that the discount system would be abandoned soon afterwards. The Government know that it is unworkable, but the system is a sop to Conservative Members who would prefer to keep the poll tax. I wish that the Government had the intellectual honesty to withdraw the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of intellectual honesty, the hon. Gentleman will know that the next group of amendments to clause 11 proposes a set of discounts that is far more complex than what the Government have proposed. How can the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is that the first of the amendments that we are discussing would do away with the discount system and replace it with rebates. That seems to us to be a fair way. However, if the Government oppose that proposal because they wish to keep the discount system, as seems probable, the argument will move on and we shall discuss ways in which a discount system can be targeted on those in genuine need. That is an example of the dilemma that always faces the Opposition, given that we believe that there should not be a system of discounts and that the problem should be handled through rebates. Our amendments would ensure that if there is to be a discount system, it will be targeted. If the Under-Secretary cannot understand the Opposition's aims now, he will be able to understand them after the general election, when he will be in opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, "Hear, hear", and I know that the Committee is anxious to go to lunch, but the discount system is a last ditch attempt to keep some elements of the poll tax alive. It is designed to appease well-off Conservative voters and those Conservative Members who wish that the poll tax had not been abandoned. I wish that the Government had some intellectual honesty left about their own legislation and that they would scrap these proposals here and now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) complained about the hardships suffered by single millionaires. He said that they should be entitled to a discount because they paid so much more in national taxes. I warn the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
that when the incoming Labour Government do away with discounts, he will have no takers for a book or film script based on the idea of the hardship that such a person might suffer. Moreover—I had thought that this point had been argued to death—just because a person is a widow does not mean that she needs any financial help, what matters are her financial circumstances. I should have thought it obvious that not all widows need a discount. I can think of one particular widow well known for her sweet smile and her large hats who occasionally occupies a large castle in Scotland. Does she need any such help?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are fond of making accusations about a lack of care for widows, but I shall tell the Committee about a widow in my constituency whose son died at the age of 16 in a tragic accident. The following week, she went to hand in her child benefit book and was told that her weekly benefit would have to be reduced. It had been calculated on the assumption that she had a child but, now that he was no longer alive, her benefit had to be cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The woman was in such a state of shock that she did not understand what was said to her, so I inquired on her behalf. The answer that I got from the Minister in this caring Tory Government was that, because the woman no longer had responsibility for the child, there was nothing to prevent her from going to work, despite the fact that there was no work in my constituency, apart from low-paid, part-time work. Of course, that is completely irrelevant to the Government. Only after a year or so of intensive campaigning by organisations on behalf of such women did the Government finally give in. So much for claiming to care for widows: the Government do not give a toss if a widow is poor. They create this nonsense supposedly to help all widows. It is totally unnecessary for well-off widows.

The point about families using local authority services more than single-parent households has been debated by people in local government. People who work in local government recognise that it is nonsense to make such a differentiation. For example, the work done by a local education department benefits not only children and their families but the entire community. It benefits future employers, too, because children do not leave school pig ignorant—they can read, write and count and are able to acquire skills. It cannot be argued that, if there are X number of people in a family, that family is receiving more benefit from the authority. But of course we must remember that, in the recent past, some people denied that there was any such thing as society and community. No doubt some good Thatcherites sitting on the Conservative Benches still believe that in their heart of hearts, although they no longer say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A social work department is another large spender. Its entire budget is spent on people with severe difficulties whose problems are often exacerbated by a standard of living that is much lower than the average. The local authority's expenditure has to be spread throughout the community, regardless of whether the person with severe problems is in a one-person household or is a member of a large family that is suffering multiple problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone could say, "I do not use libraries, so I should not have to pay for them." That is nonsense, because we all benefit from the fact that others borrow books from the library: their knowledge and understanding benefits the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
community. The Government should accept that people should pay according to their ability, regardless of the services that they use. The charge is a tax, not a bill for services used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I asked questions in a previous debate, the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment said that he would deal with the matters at a relevant point. This is that relevant point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At column 71 of the 	<i>Official Report,</i> I asked the Under-Secretary whether a single working mother with a 20-year-old daughter who came home from college for the summer vacation would lose the 25 per cent. discount to which she was entitled: The hon. Gentleman replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The bills of single mothers will not be affected by the return of a 20-year-old daughter during a vacation as the hon. Lady suggested. Students cannot affect a household's bill because of the discount proposal."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 19 November 1991; c. 75.]</p></blockquote>
Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the meaning of the answers given on Tuesday evening? Will a student be covered as a student and remain invisible during the long summer vacation and over Christmas and Easter? Under the poll tax legislation, students do not remain invisible for the entire time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is careful not to specify who will and will not be treated as a student. Clause 4(2) does not define any terms and leaves them open to be assigned by parliamentary order. It is important to know whether the Government have detailed proposals or whether the Under-Secretary of State was simply fobbing us off the other night. It is important also to know whether Ministers will confirm that students will be disregarded during all holidays—summer, Christmas and Easter. We should know what their status will be at the end of the last summer term. Will they be disregarded until they get employment or until the beginning of the academic year? That impinges directly on my example of an otherwise single household that will receive the 25 per cent. discount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary implied that there would be no administrative consequences when the daughter came home during the vacation because the mother's entitlement to discount would not change. However, under the Bill, will not the mother be obliged to notify the authorities of a change in status of the household when the daughter comes home and then returns to the area in which she is undertaking full-time education? How will that work in practice? Will the mother simply notify the authorities? Will that not interfere with the discount, but leave much administration to be covered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During last Tuesday's sitting, I quoted from a document leaked from the Department of Social Security, which caused Conservative Members considerable amusement. As my question was not answered, I shall repeat it. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a person entitled to a status discount in a 2-person household is the liable person, he will be billed as a single person household: but if there are 2 other adults in the household, neither of whom qualify for the discount, he will not receive any discount. Where the liable person would qualify for a status discount and second person CTB…the status discount will trump the second person CTB."</p></blockquote>
That is a direct quote from the Department of Social Security document. I asked how the local authority would know about the household. The Under-Secretary replied that he always tried to be helpful and that we should be wary of leaked documents. Referring to me, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The document that she quoted was taken from a working paper of the benefits sub-group, which was set up by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
Department of Social Security. It set out proposals for discussion. The proposals were and are being simplified in the light of comments that were received."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 19 November 1991; c. 76.]</p></blockquote>
Presumably, when replying to the debate, the Under-Secretary will give the Committee precise answers about how the system will be simplified and made workable and how it will impinge on the cases which I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount system will be immensely difficult to administer. The successful operation of the system is based on the assumption that people remain in the same place and that their circumstances do not change. It does not reflect the complexities of people's lives or changing circumstances. I quote the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a client…had six changes of income status and three moves of address (all different local authorities) in ten months." How would the discount system deal with that person? The example continues:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"For three months the client was a full time student living in local authority A paying 20 per cent. of the community charge. Then the client moved to local authority B, had a part-time job and claimed community charge benefit (CCB). Then she claimed income support and was once again paying 20 per cent. of the community charge. Following this she had two months on a fluctuating income…and in receipt of benefit. This was followed by a return to her parental home in local authority C where she claimed income support and was responsible for 20 per cent. community charge to this third local authority. She then returned to local authority A to become a full time post-graduate student and became liable to 20 per cent. of community charge on grounds of her student status."</p></blockquote>
That happened in a 10-month period. It is not uncommon. How would the discount system deal with such problems?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complexities of the scheme cannot be understood and worked through in Committee, either by people who claim to know their legislation because they are part of the Government who propose it or by others who challenge the legislation and seek clarification. How will people who bear the onus to apply for a discount stand a chance of understanding their entitlement? If no clear explanations of entitlement to discount exist, people will barrage their local authorities with correspondence, questions and applications. As happened when the community charge was introduced, local authorities will be swamped by administration and it will be impossible for them to operate any discount system fairly, quickly and accurately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I worked in a rates department when I left school. That department operated a discount system for fast payment, to facilitate the cash flow of local authorities. But the motivation for the Government's proposal is neither to help local authorities collect their income quickly nor to make people pay more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are using the fact that there were such discounts before to give credence to their proposals. Of course, there is also a marketing ploy; it is somehow a bargain to be granted a discount. That is not the reality of the discounts proposed in the Bill. The discounts are unfair and arbitrarily contrived so that there will be a considerably lower bill for relatively few single people regardless of their ability to pay—a continuation of the poll tax.

It is not appropriate that people will receive discounts just because they are single, as the discounted proportion of their bill will have to be paid by families. In that sense, the discount is anti-family. Why should a single millionaire receive the benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I re-read last week's 	<i>Hansard</i> report of the debate on joint and several liability in which I referred to women who were the victims of domestic violence or who had been deserted. I said that they should be protected, especially as the Government had introduced independent taxation. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"May I check whether the hon. Member agrees that benefit should be given to the penniless wife of a millionaire? That flows directly from his suggestion."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 21 November 1991; c. 299.]</p></blockquote>
I made it clear that I want such people to pay their full share. The Minister implied that, if my suggestion were adopted, the wife of a millionaire would not have to pay. In the light of the discount, that is a breathtaking statement. A single millionaire or an heiress would be given the discount. The Minister is trying to justify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The real crux of the argument is whether someone on average income who lives on his own in a three-bedroomed semi-detached house should pay the same amount as a family of four on a similar income who live next door and use more services. That is the point of the argument, not millionaires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman's football skill at Wembley. His individualistic approach might have let us down a little. If he had had more of a team spirit, we would have been better. That brings us back to the point: why should individual millionaires—although they are few—receive the discount when a family of four will not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) is probably right in his claim that there are few single millionaires living in this country? They are abroad, living in tax havens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is a good point. However, if they lived in this country, they would be eligible for discount, which shows how unfair the proposals are. I was not criticising the football skills of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) but was merely illustrating my point.

Under the council tax proposals, the Secretary of State for the Environment will pay £272 for his Belgravia mansion. In 25 of London's 32 councils people living in properties worth as little as £40,000 will pay more than him. Indeed, in eight boroughs people living in a garden shed will pay more than him. If he sold his mansion to a single millionaire, he would receive a 25 per cent. discount. That is an extreme example of the unfairness of the proposals, but it shows how anomalies can arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is equally unfair that people in one borough
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
in inner London should have to pay much more for the same service as those in another borough, as a comparison of Wandsworth and Lambeth shows? Is that not unfair on the poor as well as the rich?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. That is why a fairer system should have been introduced especially with regard to SSAs. The grant system is grossly unfair, but the Government are not prepared to change the SSA system in their proposals for the council tax. Therefore, many of the unfairnesses of the poll tax will remain in the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman devise a system that ensures that ratepayers, council tax payers or community charge payers in Lambeth have services provided as efficiently as in Wandsworth and, for example, have their bins emptied without paying three times the cost. If the local authority is inherently inefficient, the grant system makes no difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A fairer system would remove penalties. When there is the slightest overspending—which may not necessarily be the council's fault—the council is penalised and bills go through the roof. It would also be fairer to remove from the Government grant system the fiddles that give Wandsworth and Westminster an enormous boost. The Government have known about the administrative problems in Lambeth—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, I would not call the officers incompetent. The problems that they have had to face are enormous, and the Government have never been interested in solving them. They have always wanted Lambeth to be a problem borough. If that were not the case, they would have helped the officers and councillors solve their severe problems. The Government have repeatedly used Lambeth as a scapegoat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, as he is talking about my borough. Does he agree that 14 years ago both Wandsworth and Lambeth were in a state of dereliction and that both were run by the Labour party? That was the problem identified by the Government and the people of Lambeth and Wandsworth. On the issue of grants and SSAs, Wandsworth's low-cost, affordable, high-quality services have been achieved with a central Government grant that is two thirds of that given to Lambeth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All sorts of fiddles have taken place with the grant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wandsworth received much more in urban development funds than Lambeth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has referred to the greater urban development grant, which is just one example of a fiddle. The operation of the penalties system, especially, has benefited Wandsworth and hugely disadvantaged Lambeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am being allowed to continue the point, even though it is not directly related to the amendment, I shall tell the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) that I spoke at a meeting in his borough, at the time that a baby died after social workers had recommended that that baby be taken into care. The baby was not taken into care, because of the cuts imposed by the council. We know that babies up and down the country can die because of child abuse, but most local authorities—especially Labour authorities—want to solve such problems. Most authorities want to help such children, but Wandsworth wanted to make cuts instead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have a sneaking suspicion that the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporter will have found it difficult to get all that down verbatim, although I am of course enjoying it. Perhaps the Committee will calm down a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Member for Battersea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will not hold that case up as typical. It was a very sad case, in which a family lost a baby. The thorough investigation that took place afterwards, into the circumstances of the mistakes that individuals had made, also showed that Wandsworth had the highest per capita level of child social services support in inner London. So it was not a question of cuts. There was better support for children in that borough, and there is still better support, in all the social services in Wandsworth, than in any of the neighbouring Labour boroughs. Those boroughs know that and they regret it. We are proud of our support, although, of course we deplore any individual case such as that of the baby who died. I hope that the hon. Member for Leyton will withdraw his accusation that that case had anything to do with the quality of the social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was an immensely sad case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) may respond to that request if he wishes, but I am concerned that hon. Members are not discussing the amendments, which deal with discounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Leadbitter. I shall return to the discounts. I thought that you would pull us up on that before, but as you did not, I drifted on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly finish the point about the very sad case of the baby. When I spoke at the meeting in Wandsworth, the council employees to whom I spoke had very different views of the matter from those of the hon. Member for Battersea. They made it clear that the social services had recommended that the child should be brought into care, but it was not because of the indirect impact of the council's policies in relation to the costs of taking children into care. No doubt we shall return to that case in a future debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are enormous anomalies in the system. For example, a couple who look after a mentally impaired individual will not be eligible for a discount, yet someone living next door on his own, who might be relatively wealthy, will be eligible for it. That shows that the discounts are not being properly targeted, for example, towards carers, such discount would be justifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will regard the system as unfair and, as my hon. Friends said, it will be immensely difficult to administer. By claiming that there is no need for a register, the Government are misleading people. Either they are naive in believing that no register is needed for such a complex system or they are being deceptive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On my hon. Friend's point about perceptions of the tax, is he aware that, referring to the rating system, the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The public will recognise clearly the arbitrary way in which both the Discounts and Protection are awarded without any regard to the ability-to-pay. It should be borne in mind that over the last two and half years the public perception of fairness has been heightened and it should not be ignored if major changes to the new tax after implementation are to be avoided."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
That shows that the tax cannot be made to work if those perceptions are not taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to make that point, because collection of the tax depends on the public's perception of it as fair. I do not believe that we shall encounter the problem of uncollectability that arose with the poll tax because it is hard to imagine that another tax would be so difficult to collect or would meet such opposition. Nevertheless, we want maximum collection of the tax so that local authorities can provide the social services to which reference has been made. For them to do so, they need to be able to collect as much of the tax as possible but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) said, if the public perceives it as unfair, they will not pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People write to borough treasurers about an extra £50 or so on their poll tax bills. People who are charged extra for the poll tax that councils have been unable to collect write saying that they will not pay the extra amount. The problems are exacerbated in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee that people will analyse the discounts that are given out and ask, "Why should we be asked to pay for someone else's discount? We will not pay anything extra." They will lop a bit off their bills in consequence, which could cause problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will result in an administrative nightmare because a register is needed for such a complicated tax. Discounts are to be provided on a daily basis and, inevitably, that will require a close record of movements. As has been said, many young and single people living in London move frequently, so a record of their movements will need to be kept by the local authorities which administer the discount system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, there will again be an on the electoral register. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) rightly spent a considerable part of his speech talking about the implications for the electoral register, and I hope that the Minister will pick up the challenge. The Minister is on record as saying that local authorities do not need a register, so they can refer to the electoral register. That has serious implications. The electoral register was intended purely for the purpose of voting—for a democratic purpose. People did not give their names for any other purpose. If people think that the electoral register will be used for some other purpose, they will be loth to register, especially if they think that it will be used for taxation purposes. The Minister must respond to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon. Friend of the exchange between the Minister and me about double garages. Local authorities build such garages away from properties and allow them to be rented. The Minister said that that would be taken into consideration in the residential qualification, and that it would be for the Secretary of State to determine into which category that would come. If the property were classed as residential and one person were living in it, it would qualify for a discount. Would a garage qualify for a discount if it were brought into the list by the Secretary of State? Perhaps my hon. Friend will ponder that and see whether he understands it. I do not—it is ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and the mind boggles at such an example. I encourage the Minister to respond to such points. If he does not, local authorities will have no choice but to administer the discount system as enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
The more expensive the property, the bigger the discount will be. Ability to pay is not taken into account. The poor gain next to nothing from the discount system because the rebate that they get will be set against the discount that they get. The measure is directed one way—towards the wealthy. It is not targeted properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has implications for young people, although it is not quite as bad as the poll tax, which encouraged elderly couples to force their 18 or 19-year-old son or daughter out of the home to avoid another bill. However, a single person with an 18-year-old son or daughter will not get the discount to which he or she would otherwise be entitled, so single parents may still encourage their teenage sons or daughters to leave home sooner than would otherwise be the choice of either side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NACAB has expressed considerable concern about the discount system, which it views as a disincentive to single people to take in tenants. NACAB also points out that the register will create numerous problems because it relies on people living long term at the same address and does not take proper account of their changing circumstances. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South made the same point when she spoke about the person who had moved six times in three local authority areas. As NACAB says, people's lives are not neatly predictable and do not fit into an easy system without a register. Even with a register, details of people's movements would have to be kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NACAB quotes the Audit Commission's report, "The Administration of the Community Charge: Some Longer Term Considerations", which was produced in January this year. It estimated that the turnover of register entries would average 40 per cent. for district authorities, 50 per cent. for metropolitan areas and 60 per cent. for London boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefing notes contain several examples. Private tenants face major problems over registration. An example is given of a CAB client who was a lodger in a private home but whose landlady did not declare him when she registered for the poll tax. The client registered despite the landlady's advice and was then chucked out; he was given 28 days notice to leave. A CAB in Staffordshire reports a client made homeless by friends who did not want him entered on their registration form. A CAB in north London reports that a resident landlord evicted six tenants because of the possibility of the Inland Revenue finding out about them through the poll tax register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those examples show the impact that the single person discount could have; similar pressures could be put on tenants if landlords faced the loss of their discounts because it became known that they had tenants. NACAB is right to draw attention to that fact. It points out that some landlords do not want to declare publicly that they have tenancy agreements. Undoubtedly, that will remove from the market some homes that would otherwise be available for the homeless. NACAB states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We fear that the single person discount, with or without a register, may similarly deter people from renting out rooms in their homes."</p></blockquote>
This is a distressing matter for many who fear having to register but who also fear losing their homes if they do because of their landlord's attitude. By denying that there will be a register, the Government are not taking account of the implications of NACAB's advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
In conclusion, NACAB states that its clients' concern to keep their homes in preference to registering for the community charge causes considerable distress, anxiety and financial hardship. Not only are clients anxious about not registering but they may be deterred from using council services or claiming local authority administered benefits.

The discount system is unfair. A rebate system would be fairer and more comprehensive. People's bills would be lower overall. Pensioners should have higher pensions to enable them to pay the bills without recourse to discounts or rebates. The Government's record on pensions is poor. Pensions are at the bottom of the Euro-league and are breaking the link with earnings. Higher pensions would be a better solution than discounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my colleagues will reject the amendment. Part of what I have heard has been nauseating and offensive. I vividly remember that, under the old rating system in Scotland, a widow would face having to leave the family home because she had only a small pension—perhaps the widow of a serviceman's pension—and could not meet the local authority's demands. Anyone who has forgotten that experience has forgotten what happened in Scotland following the revaluations. Because of that experience, the Government have included the 25 per discount in the Bill. Many of us consider that disturbing and distressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not surprise members of the Committee to hear that the husbands of a substantial number of Scottish widows were service men. That is because, with less than 9 per cent. of the United Kingdom population, the Scots contribute more than 20 per cent. of the personnel of the Army, the Navy and the Royal Air Force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a minute. The issue is important. Given our experience of the problems under the rating system, and the circumstances in which many widows found themselves it was considered essential to take account of such factors. That, in turn, gave rise to the discount provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is showing great concern. Did he vote to impose the 20 per cent. minimum payment of, first, the rates and, secondly, the poll tax on widows living in Castlemilk in my constituency? Before such a decision, widows of ex-service men might have been among those people who were paying nothing in rates. Although the word "hypocritical" might be unparliamentary, it certainly fits the bill when I consider the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention is astonishing, given that it comes from the source of all humbug. My views on the community charge have not changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This Chairman usually makes suggestions rather than rulings. It makes it a little difficult for the Chairman if, after he makes a reasonable suggestion, the hon. Gentleman responds with, "I will return kind with kind". The Chairman suggests that that is an understandable overreaction of the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chairman was not reflecting on the hon. Gentleman's previous statements, but was referring to a specific statement. My suggestion could be interpreted as a ruling—but not as hard and fast a one as some people would consider it to be. When the hon. Gentleman made his remarks, my immediate reaction was to say that they was understandable. Therefore, it showed that I understood his overreaction. The matter should not be taken any further than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who am I to argue with the Chair? After all, I am sure that, after reading the report of our proceedings, members of the Committee can judge whether I was responding to kind with kind. I shall not go beyond that, Mr. Leadbitter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our experience in Scotland over many years made us genuinely worried about the widows whom I have described. I could describe others. The Opposition have put up a smoke screen as usual. They talk about mythical millionaires. I am neither single nor a millionaire and I, therefore, have no axe to grind. However, many of my constituents gave up their family homes because they could not meet the continuing and ever-rising costs of rates demands. In response to such circumstances, the Government introduced changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My views on the community charge have not changed: the level was wrong but the charge itself was good. In considering the reason for the proposed changes in funding local government and the level at which we expect the local community to contribute, we should not forget the single people whose circumstances forced changes to the Scottish legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, may I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he still believes that there should be a 20 per cent. minimum payment of the council tax? If so, a widow living alone, perhaps in a council house, would still have to pay 20 per cent. If that is not what the hon. Gentleman believes, I do not understand what he is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman had done me the courtesy of reading the paper that I wrote on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I have much better things to do than to read papers written by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Kind with kind. If the hon. Gentleman had taken the trouble to read my paper, he would know that I recommended shifting a substantial part of the charge to value added tax. The Government noted what I said and did just that! If that had been done at the outset, as I wanted, there would have been no need for the 20 per cent. and the other proposals because there would have been a simple charge with a simple rebate as proposed in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman fails to understand why I am so pleased that the Government have embraced much of what I wanted. I am delighted with the simple method of discount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has repeated himself so often that it would be a good for him to listen to other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
views. However, I shall give way to him in a moment as I want to hear him repeat himself once again. The Opposition, as ever, are blinkered and unable to understand the logic and simplicity of the proposal and the reasons for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not have the opportunity to read the hon. Gentleman's paper. I am interested to hear that he supported a rise in VAT. Does he agree with the comments made on Second Reading by the hon. Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Howell), who asked why the Government did not do the job properly and add another 2–5 per cent. on VAT so that they could get rid of "this wretched tax". Does the hon. Member for Tayside, North agree with those comments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is considerable merit in the proposal, which warrants detailed examination. If the hon.

I do not understand why he is asking the question, except that he wishes to be mischievous and to repeat himself yet again.

I hope that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench will bear in mind the points that I have made especially those about service widows, to whom the Opposition Front Bench never give any consideration.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good afternoon, Mr. Leadbitter. This is the second time that you have called me a few minutes before 1 o'clock. My hon. Friends the Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) illustrated succinctly the anomalies and complications that the discount system will create for a huge number of payers throughout the United Kingdom. Even at this early stage in the debate, we have proved that a rebate system and a taxation system based on people's ability to pay would be fairer and simpler than a complicated system of discounts which creates complexities and anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham has awakened the Committee and, I hope, the national press to the fact that the Government's proposed scheme has the potential to create administrative chaos. We shall need a register if the discount system is to be administered fairly. Birmingham city council, which shares the Opposition's view, issued a statement this morning. The treasurer said that the council will introduce a register of council tax payers to ensure that the proposals are implemented in a way which allows its financial department to collect the council tax effectively and to set up a fair system for those eligible for discounts or exemptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the register could be like that operating under the Conservatives in Brent?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.
