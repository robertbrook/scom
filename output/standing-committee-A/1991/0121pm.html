	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are considering amendment No. 20, in page 37, line 24, at end add
	<br><q><p>'(5) After paragraph 4(1) there shall be inserted—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned, I was deciding whether to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the Minister's reference to Highways Act 1980. Did he mean that a railway operator would be required to display a notice for 10 years when a crossing is closed down? We were discussing how long the requirement would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed by the Minister's response to amendment No. 20. With no disrespect to you, Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
Latham, I am also slightly disappointed that your distinguished colleague, the hon. Member for Oldham, Central and Royton (Mr. Lamond), is not in the Chair, because I wanted to say that this summer I was walking on the Oldham way. Oldham local authority has produced some attractive leaflets to publicise it. I met an elderly gentleman who was keen to talk to me. He was not using one of the new impressive leaflets to find his way around but a battered volume of press cuttings. They were a series of articles about walks around Manchester compiled by the 	<i>Manchester Evening News</i> in the 1940s and 1950s. He explained that he was enjoying retracing those tracks. It was interesting to see from the cuttings the number of mills that had closed and other interesting points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nice, in theory, to think that people walking footpaths will have up-to-date maps and guidebooks; but in practice many people are walking around the countryside with very out-of-date ones. It is most important that a clear notice is set up where a diversion is made so that someone who is following an old map or guidebook gets up-to-date information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to recognise that this point had some validity, because he said that under the Highways Act 1980 it is a requirement to publish a notice at the point of the diversion. Will that notice spell out, in map form, the alternative route? How long will that notice remain? The amendment refers to "ten years", which should be the minimum amount of time. Who will pay for that notice? If British Rail can move the crossing and save a considerable amount of money, it seems reasonable to require it to set up and pay for a map to show the diversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister be more forthcoming on this matter and, perhaps, speed up the Committee by accepting amendment No. 20 or the spirit of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be slightly cautious, because whenever the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) suspects that he will not get what he wants he dangles the suggestion that the only way I will speed up the Committee is to agree to an amendment. Although I would not regard them as concessions, during our proceedings we have come across a number of genuine points and have attempted to make improvements. I must, however, resist the hon. Gentleman's tempting suggestion that it would speed up this part of the Bill if I accepted the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are copying the Highways Act. It would not be a good idea to introduce new provisions. Nothing in sections 118 or 119 of that Act does what the hon. Gentleman requests. I do not want to depart from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have had that final clarification from the Minister, like my hon. Friend I am very disappointed. The notice that is required by the Highways Act is quite simply that an order has been confirmed. There is nothing about putting that order in place for any length of time, nor must it give any details of the alternative route that people must follow. The example that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) just gave about how people hold on to guide books or newspaper cuttings for a long time and use Ordnance Survey maps that have not been reprinted in the past 10 years is proof, if ever any were needed, that the concerns could and should have been taken on board by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister has not said anything about local authorities making a rail crossing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
diversion and whether the sign proposed in amendment No. 20 would be needed. He should have addressed the issue for safety reasons. I am disappointed that he has not taken the matter on board. I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but we may wish to return to it on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendmemt, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 37, line 2, at end insert
	<br><q><p>'for the definition of "railway" there shall be substituted</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"'railway' has the same meaning as in the Transport and Works Act 1992;"</p></q>
	<br><q><p>and after the definition of "traffic sign" there shall be inserted—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"'tramway' has the same meaning as in the Transport and Works Act 1992;".'.</p></q>
The purpose of the amendment is self-explanatory. If the Minister agrees, the words "railway" and "tramway" would be properly denned. Rather than elaborate further I shall wait to see what his response is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) moved the amendment. There are, no doubt, a number of useful changes that might be made to the Highways Act, but unless they are necessary for the purposes of the Bill —such as those relating to rail crossings—now is not the time to deal with them. The amendment has no practical effect and I hope that the hon. Lady will not therefore press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not very helpful. If now is not the time, perhaps the Minister could tell us when the right time might be. During the Committee stage of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 we were told that it was not the right time to propose amendments because we would be creating an unlevel playing field by putting different priorities in different legislation. Exactly the same principle applies here. When will it be the right time? I can see that the Minister perhaps cannot make general amendments to the Highways Act but would he consider improving the definitions of "railway" and "tramway" in paragraph 119A(11)? I am watching the Minister to see whether he will take one last opportunity to respond to the issue raised in the amendments. He does not appear to want to do so. Given his lack of response, now may not be the right time to press it and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 100 and 101.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 49 increases the penalty for the offence of failing to shut a gate at an accommodation crossing to level 3 on the standard scale. These small amendments seek to provide for the offence to apply equally where there is a manually operated barrier. Failure

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister also require British Rail to ensure that the gates swing backwards and forwards efficiently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a management matter, but it would be important in any action brought by British Rail.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to the director of legal and administration services of the borough of south Tyneside, the coroner of Gateshead and south Tyneside, Mr. William Duffy, referred to the death of a seven-year-old girl at the farm crossing which is known as Newton Garths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1 of the letter states:
	<br><q><p>"The gate on the Biddick Hall Estate side was frequently left open and fastened back by barbed wire as illustrated in photograph number 6 herewith."</p></q>
Paragraph 2 continues:
	<br><q><p>"The fencing on the Biddick Hall Estate side of the gate was defective in that it was non-existent by the side of the gate and pedestrians could easy walk through."</p></q>
The final paragraph states:
	<br><q><p>"Generally, I am of the opinion that the procedures adopted for the use of this crossing should be reviewed as a matter of urgency."</p></q>
I shall refer to the coroner's report later when I talk about the actions of British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Newton Garths crossing, as it is known in my area, has been in operation for 151 years. It serves a farm which has a field with horses. Youngsters on the Biddick Hall side of the estate feed and play with the horses. This has been a danger for some time, so much so that even British Rail recognised it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1985, the farm's owners applied for planning permission for a change of use of the field, which is just over the crossing from the housing estate. Mr. and Mrs. Bates wanted to use the field for a riding school, instead of for grazing purposes. Regarding their application, the estate surveyor's department at British Rail replied to the chief planner of South Tyneside council:
	<br><q><p>"The Railway Board's opposition is based on the safety aspect, due to the requirement for all visitors, potential customers to the farm Riding School having to cross the Newcastle to Sunderland main line railway via the Newton Garths Farm Occupational Level Crossing …</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Local rail staff, train crews etc. continue to report bad gate discipline by users of this crossing, and a B.R. representative has visited the Farm on a number of occasions in recent months with a view to ensuring that in future, the crossing gates are closed after use."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
That response to the planning application was dated 6 March 1985—which is, incidentally, my birthday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In August 1984, British Rail also objected to another planning application for the same farm because of the danger posed by the crossing. So the danger has existed for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Philip Mohamed was away from his family on the day of the accident, working on North sea oil rigs. In our area there is not a great deal of work and people who want employment to support their families often have to travel a long way to work. He went away and left his wife to look after the family. On the day in question, the children were taken across to their great-aunt, who was to keep an eye on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The road accesss to the farm goes across spare ground which is owned by the local authority and then over the railway crossing on the Sunderland to Newcastle line, which is used by 120 trains a day travelling at 65 mph. There is a cave immediately before the trains reach the crossing and the nearest signal box is a mile up the line at Boldon colliery. So the signal man at the colliery cannot see the crossing. There is a telephone at the crossing and before people open the gate they should phone the signal man who then puts the train on caution when someone is about to use the crossing. That telephone is often vandalised and out of order. Indeed, it was out of order for weeks before the accident due to vandalism, for which there is no excuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the danger at the crossing, British Rail should have ensured that the telephone was working every day and that the gate on the crossing was functional and not fastened back, as invariably happened. I do not know whether the little girl would have been saved had British Rail carried out those duties, but it would have given her a better chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give vehicles easy access, there is timber hiding the line. The little girl thought that she was walking along a road to get to a field on the other side of the line in which she had seen horses. She was a six-year-old child and did not realise the danger. She was killed, and there was outrage in the area because in 1984 and 1985, in response to a planning application, British Rail had expressed its concern about the danger and maintenance at that crossing. Philip Mohamed, whose wife was involved in that accident and subsequently received psychiatric treatment, started a petition. He had to give up his job working on oil rigs and stay at home to look after his wife and family. By the time that he approached me he had already been in constant contact and correspondence with British Rail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. I regret that this is the second occasion on which I have had to rise on a point of order to draw to your attention my objection to sedentary remarks, which you may not have been able to hear, but which I find deeply offensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not hear the remarks to which the hon. Lady referred because I was listening carefully to the important speech of the hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon), but I am sure that we all deplore sedentary interruptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to give way to anyone who wants to intervene. I did not hear the remarks, yet I deliberately put in my hearing aid so that I would be able to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Latham. For your information, the remark, as I understood it, had a distinctly racist overtone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I did not hear what the hon. Lady said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the remark made from a sedentary position had a distinctly racist overtone; hence my objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair did not hear the alleged remarks, so I think that it would be best if the hon. Gentleman would continue his speech. The hon. Lady's point has been noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Philip Mohamed had to give up work to look after his wife and family. He could do nothing to bring back his six-year-old daughter, Lisa, whose death had had a traumatic effect on himself and his wife. So he decided to campaign to get the crossing closed because it was dangerous to children. The danger was aggravated by the fact that a school closed on the Biddick Hall side of the land and the children had to go to Boldon Colliery. Some of them took a shortcut across Newton Garths crossing, putting their lives in danger. We urged BR to close that crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter from the Minister, who agreed that the crossing should be closed and said that BR was negotiating with the local authorities. We were faced with the old wrangle over whether is was the responsibility of BR or the local authorities to pay for the alternative crossing if the existing one was closed. Negotiations had to take place between certain landowners and South Tyneside council's planning department to decide where to put an alternative road which would give access to the farm. BR said that it was prepared to make a contribution. South Tyneside council said that it did not have the cash to make the contribution and that it was BR's responsibility—I agree that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result was that BR, at last, decided to pay for that crossing. I add that BR did not write to tell us that it was prepared to make the contribution until after the Christmas Adjournment debate. It said that it would close the crossing in March 1992. The local paper carried an article saying that BR was prepared to pay whatever it would cost to provide an alternative route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Philip Mohamed carried on his campaign for some considerable time. He went to the library and read books about BR. I have no doubt that he knows more about the 1839 Act than any members of the Committee. He went to the South Tyneside and Newcastle libraries and studied the Acts. He wrote to the BR safety inspectorate pointing out the dangers of the crossing. He wanted the crossing to be manned at all times until the alternative access was made and the crossing closed.

The local paper carried a front page article under the heading "Girl's Death Backlash" after a statement had been made by Brian Ward, who was alleged to be the public relations representative of British Rail's York headquarters. In that statement he said that it was the parents' fault that Lisa was killed because they had not supervised her properly. That is an outrageous statement. Mrs. Mohamed, who had been ill for a long time after Lisa's death, was upset and had to take sedatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Mohamed has written many letters to the Department of Transport. I shall quote one, because it summarises what Philip Mohamed has done in his

campaign to have the crossing closed and an alternative access provided to the farm. The letter is addressed to the present Secretary of State for Transport, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), and says:
	<br><q><p>"On the 14th May 1990 my seven-year-old daughter was killed on an unmanned level crossing on the Newcastle/Sunderland main line as she walked from a field used by children to play in across the crossing to see horses in the adjoining field. The gate was tied open with barbed wire and no warning or other signs were in place.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>It was only her third or fourth visit to her great aunts and she was unaware that the crossing existed. When she got to the end of the road and seen the horses she would have assumed they were just in another field, she wouldn't of known she was on a railway line as the tracks are recessed to accommodate vehicles"—</p></q>
a point that I made earlier. It continues:
	<br><q><p>"The crossing is situated between two large housing estates called Biddick Hall and Boldon Colliery with over 10,000 residents.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>A secondary school closed on the Biddick Hall side of the crossing and the children now have to attend a secondary school on the Boldon side.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The unmanned crossing has now become an unauthorised shortcut for many school children who use the crossing as an easy and quicker route than waiting and using the school bus, and also enables them to use their bus fare on other things.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I firmly believe British Rail's statutory obligation at this crossing are not being adhered to for the reasons I will mention in a moment."</p></q>
Mr. Mohamed goes on to say that Biddick Hall is in my constituency. I should add that it did not come into my constituency until after the boundary changes in 1984. As a result, my majority rose from 14,000 to just under 20,000, so I was not displeased about Biddick Hall falling in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Mohamed's letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"Mr. Don Dixon … wrote to you on 14th December asking you to order an enquiry into the dangers that exist at the crossing.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>No enquiry was authorised. If the crossing's inherent dangers were not enough to warrant an inquiry, maybe BR not maintaining public safety will be.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I will now explain where BR are not adhearing to their legally agreed standards of safety. I have also wrote to the Railway Inspectorate.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I believe beyond doubt that the gates at Harrison farm crossing should be properly manned, for these unequivocal reasons. For years South Tyneside M.B.C."—</p></q>
that is the metropolitan borough council—
	<br><q><p>"have provided a private road to Newton Garth farm, it was laid and is maintained by the council and the money to lay and maintain this road is taken from the old rates and now from the community charge"—</p></q>
referred to locally as the poll tax.
	<br><q><p>"In 1982 Mr. Bates the farmer applied for planning permission to build a 14 stable livery and also to use fields he either owns leases or hires as land for grazing horses belonging to members of the public. His application was granted by the council. British Rail wrote to the council expressing no objection even though the private road and crossing were now to be used by any member of the public to tend to their horses who arrive and depart …"</p></q>
British Rail did write and object; it considered that it was dangerous.

The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"Therefore with the approval of B.R. this so called "Private Road" is used daily by horse owners and their friends particularly young children. This particular crossing is far
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
removed from its original use and intended purpose as in 1839 yet unbelievably it has remained as it was 151 years ago. Harrions farm crossing should be manned.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>When I decided to study the railway statutes I've spent hours, days, weeks and months reading and cross referencing them in Newcastle and South Shields libraries. While reading the railway Regulation Act of 1842 section 9 it clearly stipulates that 'Whenever a railway crosses or shall hereafter cross any turnpike road or any other highway or statute labour road for carts or carriages in Great Britain etc. etc' I knew what a turnpike road is also a highway, but a 'statute labour road' I'd never heard of, neither had anyone in either library I'd been studying in. I phoned the Highway department at the town hall, they didn't know, neither did persons I'd spoken to on the phone at your department;"—</p></q>
the Department of Transport—
	<br><q><p>"but a very determined librarian vowed to find the true definition. It took her 4 restless days then she phoned me to call in as she had found the true meaning.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>She explained pre 1835 each area was responsible for maintaining its own roads, so everyone of age had to take turns in maintaining the roads or pay a fine, their labour was also unpaid."</p></q>
No doubt the Government would love to return to those days.
	<br><q><p>"But a Scotsman named John Macadam introduced a better system of road maintenance, whereby each area would pay for road maintenance out of the rates or now community charge.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Therefore as South Tyneside M.B.C. laid and maintain this private road out of local funds it is unquestionably a "Statute Labour Road" and the gate should have been and should be properly manned before it's too late.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Sections 68 and 75 of the Railway Clauses and Consolidation Act 1845 stipulates 'Accommodation Crossings', gates and fences of adjoining private lands i.e. gate from field to field to preserve the amenities of the tenant or tenants of adjoining land either side of the railway.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Neither section 68 or 75 mention turnpike roads, highways or statute labour roads or for that matter any type of road or is in contradiction with section 9 of the 1842 statutes in force. Recently B.R. who are trying very hard to evade their responsibilities are saying two distinct things to try and draw attention from the truth. The first red herring is they say the crossing is either an 'Accommodation' crossing or an occupational level crossing, why they state this when it really makes no difference, in section 9 of the 1842 Act it applies to any and every type of level crossings …</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The second is they say the road into the crossing is an accommodation road.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Whether or not B.R. want to call this road accommodation, occupational, private or any other name they can think of not only is it largely used by the General Public as stated earlier, it was laid and is maintained out of public money so it is clearly categorised as a 'Statute Labour road' and should by law, be properly manned.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>B.R. also try to hide behind Section 68 of the 1845 Act but as I've already stated, there is not even one mention of any type of form of road mentioned in that section.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I will enclose some photographs of school children still using the crossing. I have blanked their faces to protect their identity.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>On 3 of the photos you will note there is a B.R. inspecting officer giving the kids a 'ticking off". He was their like myself on an off chance and identified himself as George from the Sunderland office.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The photos were taken on 26th April at about 4.45 pm.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Also enclosed is a copy of a petition signed by local residents who would prefer to see the end of this crossing. It took just over 1 hour to get nearly 150 signatures of Residents who were very keen to sign.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Therefore because of the important points I've mentioned, the crossing's inherent dangers, ie regular use by large number of public to tend their horses, the crossing being used by schoolchildren as an easy convenient shortcut to and from school, and British Rail's statutory obligation at a crossing at a "Statute Labour Road" could I ask you and your good officers to look at procedures at this dangerous crossing and in the interest of public safety, order an inquiry to find out the dangers at this out-dated crossing.</p></q>

	<br><q><p>And with child safety being paramount I ask you to implement section 124 of the Transport Act 1968 and order B.R. to comply with the requirements you find necessary.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I hope to have your valued support to raise safety at this crossing to an acceptable level to all concerned.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>As time is beyond doubt the essence, could I ask for a speedy resolvement to this life threatening issue."</p></q>
That is a letter from a person who worked on the oil platforms and who lost a six-year-old daughter. The traumatic effect of that loss harmed his wife's health and forced him to give up his job. He decided that the crossing must be closed so that other parents would not suffer the same tragedy. That man has fought and studied in that cause. He has done research in the library, got up petitions and visited my surgery almost every month since the accident. I have visited the crossing several times and have seen the danger there. Indeed, on one visit I saw that B.R. was mending the fence. I suffer from industrial deafness, and I was now wearing my deaf aid that day, but I can assure the Committee that I was unaware of a train approaching until it was almost at the crossing. It is hard to imagine what might happen to children using that crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must pay tribute to the Minister's efforts towards resolving the problem at the crossing. He told me that the responsibility lay with BR and that no private Bill was needed to close the crossing. That was the point that I made to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) this morning: BR could have closed the crossing immediately. I am aware also that there were problems with arranging an alternative route, as different people own the relevant land. I understand that those negotiations would have taken some time. The local authority tried to help as much as possible and I believe that some BR staff, at the Minister's insistence, tried hard to get something done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what annoyed me most of all was BR's attitude in attacking the writer of that letter. He was just a labourer who, having been forced to give up his job, took to studying the relevant Acts to try to get something done about a dangerous crossing. Yet BR rolled out its big public relations guns. The story was given to the local 	<i>Gazette</i> covering the south Tyneside area, which devoted a full page to it, under the headline, in 2 in letters, "Parents Blamed for Lisa's Death". When Mr. Mohamed saw me the night after that paper came out, he was broken hearted. He said that he was frightened to go out and that people were saying that he and his wife were responsible for their daughter's death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The coroner did not blame the parents. As his letter to South Tyneside council shows, the coroner blamed the deficiencies at the gate for the accident. Why does BR take that attitude to someone who cannot bring his daughter back, but tries to prevent another accident? Two weeks after BR claimed that Lisa died because she had not been properly supervised by her parents, the same newspaper reported on a furniture van that travelled to the farm. The van went so far, but a train appeared round the corner. The van driver had to jump out of the vehicle to safety, yet BR accuses parents of not supervising their children at that crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not bore the Committee with too many details. I raised the matter in the House before Christmas. Some activity followed that debate. BR at York faxed me a letter, which proposed an immediate meeting. I replied that I would consent to a meeting when the person responsible for the scurrilous article that he had given to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
many newspapers apologised. That person had also been interviewed on Radio Newcastle. I heard a recording that Philip Mohamed brought to my surgery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have arranged a meeting with BR. I support the clause, because anyone who leaves a gate open so that youngsters or animals can get on to a road deserves to be fined heavily. The clause will not bring back Lisa, or anyone else who had died in similar circumstances, but it is nevertheless important. The Minister knows a lot about the case. I have met, as well as corresponded with him about it. I shall not spend more time on the matter, because it should be resolved in the not-too-distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure that the whole Committee wishes to join me in offering sincere condolences to Mr. and Mrs. Mohamed on the loss of their young daughter. I can think of nothing worse than the loss of a child. I have a five-year-old son. Children of that age venture out and discover new things, but they are still dependent on their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the crossing. I do not need to reiterate that it is a private crossing. Closure of the crossing is the only solution to the problems of safety and vandalism. British Rail and South Tyneside borough council are pursuing provisions for an alternative access road, which must be built before the crossing is closed. Negotiations with landowners are at an advanced stage. I understand that BR has advised the hon. Member for Jarrow that the crossing is likely to close in March 1992. I am sure that the closure cannot come soon enough for the hon. Gentleman and his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closure of the crossing is not related to the level crossing provisions of the Bill. Closure can be secured by negotiations with landowners, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out.

I have asked to see the press notice that was issued by regional railways on 28 November. It was a most insensitive ill-judged statement. I could not possibly defend it, nor would I wish to do so.

I regret that the tragedy has become a matter of public dispute. I can think of nothing worse than losing a child, and to be blamed for such a tragedy in a press release serves no purpose.

It is a pity that some people do not follow instructions for level crossings, such as closing the gates and leaving the crossing safe for other people.

It would be wise for the Minister to consider what I have to say for a future version of the Bill. The power of the Secretary of State to issue directions should apply not only to private but to public roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The harrowing event mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) could have happened in any of our constituencies, as we all know. It highlights the considerable problems that still exist in statute over railway crossings in general. It is remarkable how much argument and wringing of hands the matter causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public sensitivity is rightly very great. Reports from various inspectors show that often it is not the railwaymen on duty who are responsible for any mishaps or casualties, but the legal and regulatory context within which they and, more particularly, the person crossing the railway have to operate, whether he be a child, an adult, a pedestrian, a cyclist, someone driving a motor car, a furniture van or whatever. The statutory framework that covers people crossing the railway is clearly the responsibility of Parliament. There is no doubt about that. Parliament may, in its wisdom—or unwisdom—give the Minister of Transport or the Secretary of State options about how to exercise the powers given to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to what I described earlier as a mish-mash of difficulties. The statutory instrument procedure for new railways and others—not to mention investigations into tragedies that may occur—will keep lawyers in business for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) mentioned the Highway (Railway Crossings) Act 1839, which is one of the earliest statutes—there may be at least one earlier Act. There are many other Acts that I could name, including the Railway Regulation Act 1842, the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 referred to in clause 49, and its Scottish equivalent, the Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933 and, in particular, section 66(2) of the Transport Act 1947, which gives the Secretary of State the power, under regulations, to give derogations for the requirements and provisions of all the other Acts. I assume that clause 50 adds powers to those that already exist, hence the inclusion of subsection (2) on private crossings. I suspect that the Minister does not have such powers and wishes to establish them. My suggestion to include public property may be otiose if he already has such powers under the Transport Act 1947, as I suspect he has. Perhaps he will confirm that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have the powers under section 1 of the Level Crossings Act 1983, which provides for traffic signs and barriers to be placed on crossings where there is a public road or path?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He has confirmed my supposition and included yet another Act in the great list. I imagine that someone in Marsham street has the job of keeping all these Acts in order. They apply to 8,000 or 9,000 crossings of various varieties, each of which must have a tangle of legislation relating to its origin and operation. The balance of them are unprotected; they have no automatic or manned gates that provide the protection that, tragically, was not available in the case referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow. The public are concerned because of the number of people involved in accidents. Reports on railway safety show that there were 66 accidents in 1988, that in 1987 11 people were killed and 23 injured and that in 1988 12 people were killed and 28 were injured. It is a psychological quirk that the public take greater notice of such fatalities on the railways than they do of fatalities on the roads, which alas may be the same per day as the annual figures that I just mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried because I am not sure that the Minister is right about the powers of derogation that the 1983 Act already gives him. I put it to the Committee that that power has been used ill-advisedly. Now is perhaps the proper, once-in-a-lifetime occasion when the matter can come out in the open, clear and square.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall demonstrate my argument by referring to a level crossing that was located on an A road about 50 miles from London. That road carried considerable traffic. The level crossing had two automatic barriers that came down. When the crossing was first established, a manned signal box was located nearby so that the signal person could keep an eye on it. The traffic travelled fast as the road was fairly straight and had no developments built by its sides. It included a number of young gentlemen on motorbikes who exceeded 60 or 70 mph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When trains passed through the crossing, long queues of traffic built up quickly either side of it. British Rail
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
applied to the Secretary of State asking for the four excellent falling barriers with flashing lights to be substituted by two half barriers. In other words, the application was for one barrier on each side to come down facing the direction of travel when a train passed through. Considerable consternation was expressed about such a proposal as, not long before that, a fatality had occured with other sorts of gates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of that local controversy, I met a senior British Rail official. I shall not name the Member of Parliament in whose constituency the crossing was located, as it is not necessary. I asked the official what on earth British Rail was doing and said, "This is a main A road which is reasonably well protected yet, under that proposal, the protection for both motorists and trains will be diminished." "Oh", he said, "half barriers are better for us because if there were a breakdown on the level crossing, the person in the vehicle has a better chance of pushing it off the track towards the other side".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response, I told the official that that would be creating a greater risk. The official replied, "Oh no we are not, because the gates have to be monitored." He said that, at present, the crossing was operated by the chap in the signal box, but that British Rail wanted it to operate automatically. If a television screen were installed, that would mean that the signalman in the nearest signal centre would have to keep his eye on what was happening. When the train came within a certain distance of the crossing, he would have to glance at the screen to see if it were unobstructed and operate the signals accordingly. In other words, it would be a monitored crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said, "All right, why not do that?" The official said, "No. Under the rules that govern our modern signal centres, we cannot have more than a certain number of screens and crossings per signalman". He said that if the crossing was monitored automatically in such a way, it would mean that more people would be needed to watch the screens. I flared up a little at the official because of what he said. However, I am glad to tell the Committee that the four gates at that specific crossing are still in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that British Rail was over-enthusiastic about such a proposal. There used to be about 12 or 13 signal boxes on that line from London, but now there are two. I am worried about automatic crossings, because their productivity has increased more rapidly than it should have done. The details of the case to which I referred may not be exactly right, but I have not named the place and nor do I wish to. However, that example demonstrates the difficulties involved, in that some proposals make for less safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now refer to another sort of crossing, the facts about which will be a little clearer, but perhaps even more scary. I have contacted the hon. Member in whose constituency it is placed. However, before I do that, I shall describe the five types of crossing. There are manned gates, manned control barriers,—automatic half barriers of the sort that I have mentioned, automatic open crossings that are remotely monitored, and automatic open crossings that are locally monitored. An open crossing is one where there is no gate, only flashing lights. It may be news to some hon. Members that such crossings can be found on tarmac roads, not only on gravelled roads or cart tracks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several such crossings have been installed on the east Suffolk line. I am particularly worried by the crossing at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
Oulton Broad, a semi-suburb of Lowestoft and an area with lots of visitors. That open crossing was installed on an A road in a built-up area, with houses and shops on at least one side of the crossing. Until recently, it was a gated crossing, either manned or with dropping barriers. Not long ago, I visited the area and, to my horror, found that all except the lights had disappeared—and the lights do not always flash. A driver turning the corner about 100 yards away would suddenly come across the railway. Since then, an accident has occurred, although, fortunately, it was not fatal. Two versions have come to me of how that accident happened. One was that the person saw the flashing lights, but, not seeing any gates or barriers, or anything else normally associated with railway crossings, may have thought that it was scaffolding and did not stop. The other version was that the driver came across the railway line when the lights were not flashing but was intrigued by the crossing, there being no barriers on the road or the track. The driver was rather elderly and interested in railways and, wondering what the lights were for, reversed to have a better look. Unfortunately, the lights then began to flash, the train came along and we can imagine what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not say which of those versions is correct, but a heavily trafficked road should not rely on flashing lights alone. I am glad to say that that has changed. I have spoken to the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Porter), who said how terrible that crossing was, but that it was about to change because of road improvements in the area. But for those road improvements, which are co-incident, it would not have changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only surmise that those apparently risky crossings came about only because, the Minister has the power to abrogate the existing Acts, some of which I have quoted. There has been controversy over those crossings. A few years ago, as a result of the Lockington tragedy, the then Minister appointed Professor P. F. Stott to report on the installation of electronic gates, which we are normally pleased to have. The hon. Member for Hampshire, North-West (Sir D. Mitchell), said in a written answer, when he was Minister of Transport:
	<br><q><p>"Professor Stott has found that there are few accidents at open level crossings (on average eight a year) and that collisions are almost always due to failure of vehicle drivers to observe the signals."</p></q>
That is not surprising given the sometimes unexpected signals. He continued:
	<br><q><p>"There is no evidence that accidents have been caused by the failure of the equipment. Although the number of road vehicles and trains using automatic open crossings is lower than at other crossings, Professor Stott finds that collisions are 20 times more frequent in relation to traffic density than at the more heavily used automatic half-barrier crossings. Nevertheless, the report concludes that 70 per cent. of the existing open crossings constitute an appropriate modern replacement of manned crossings. At the remainder, traffic loading combined with train speed makes open crossings inappropriate." [	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 July 1987; Vol. 120, c. 	<i>286.</i>]</p></q>
In other words, the Stott report found that 30 per cent. of the crossings installed then—not what we might have had had the proposals gone ahead—were inappropriate. I am glad to say that, as a result of that report, the Minister said that the Government would have to think of something else and they were in the process of phased change over the next few years.

The clause gives the Minister power over private roads and paths and the Act that he mentioned gives him power

over public roads and paths, but he has not been altogether successful in using the powers that the House has given him. There has been too great a rush to minimise staffing, as in the crossings that I instanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I missed out a link in the logical chain because when I asked, "Why can't you keep somebody there?", I was told, "Well, it costs money to have someone looking out at the crossing and if we transfer it to another place someone else will have to watch it and that will increase the number of signals." So the first case was purely one of person power, despite the enormous increases in productivity involved in replacing at least a dozen signal boxes with only two, and they were not prepared to have a bit extra for safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the second case, there was the enthusiasm of an unknown person at Marsham street to authorise the extraordinary crossing at Oulton Broad. Fortunately, there was no fatality, but had any hon. Member present been to see it he or she would have been shocked. Even if it could have been proved to be safe—I do not believe that it could—it was an extraordinary state of affairs to go along what was virtually a high street and suddenly encounter a train. The maximum speed of a train over that crossing could have been as great as 55 mph. On some types of open crossing monitored by a television screen, trains could have passed at 75 mph. That risks a great deal. With trains travelling at lower speeds, the idea was that the driver could stop if he saw someone stuck on a crossing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made my points. Whatever officials may advise future Secretaries of State or Ministers on the applications, not only of British Rail but of others who may operate railways, the regulations should be tightened up. There should be thorough inspections by not only British Rail but the inspectors of railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note from the press that the safety officer of British Rail, Mr. Holmes, has resigned. I know him as a practical railwayman who helped me to get a station for my constituency about 15 years ago. I hope that his resignation was not due to any pressure from British Rail in respect of expenditure on safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be very careful about those matters in future, not merely by studying accidents that occurred in the past but by scrutiny of regulations which allow potentially dangerous crossings of the type that I saw at Oulton Broad on my holidays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clause 57 provides for amendments to the Harbours Act 1964, and removes the need for harbour authorities to promote private Bills to statutory authorisation of a wide range of ancillary harbour-related matters, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure. Therefore, the clause is important, although it is mainly technical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, which I tabled at the request of the British Ports Federation, is a tidying up proposal, and I hope that it will be accepted as such. It simply clarifies the drafting of section 37 of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966 by expressly conferring on harbour authorities the right to form companies. That could not be construed as being controversial, and I hope that it will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) has said, amendment No. 137 is intended to make it clear that a harbour authority is empowered under section 37(2) of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966 to form a company engaged in activities relating to a harbour. There is no difference between us: that power is desirable. The only difference is whether we need to spell it out further. Section 37(2) already enables a harbour authority to "subscribe for" shares in a company, and I am advised that there is no difference in law between those words and the words proposed in the amendment. Indeed, to add the additional words would merely cast doubt on what the existing words were supposed to mean. I am advised that the words in section 37(2) are sufficient and, therefore, I ask my hon.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a little like our debate on clause 28.1 want to ask whether the clause is necessary at all and, if it is to stand part of the Bill, whether safeguards can be built into it. I understand the argument that, if we are to remove private Bills, it is important to remove the harbour revision procedures. However, we must ensure that there are necessary safeguards. I am not sure that the Government have got it right. There is evidence that the Government stumbled into the Transport and Works Bill without understanding the extent of the difficulties involved. The way in which they dealt with the inland waterways made me believe that the problems developed as the debate proceeded and the same is true of the problem of the Harbour Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that about 600 harbours are covered by legislation of this sort, many of which we would not consider to be major ports. Many are leisure and recreation areas, where people have rights of way to walk, or have traditionally walked along the harbour wall, or to and from the harbour. The clause and schedule will amend the harbour legislation, but the Government have not ensured that there will be the same measure of protection for people who want to use the areas for leisure as is provided for in other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When promoters had to introduce a private Bill to amend the statutes that set up a particular port, objectors could be well informed about the issue because they could study the Bill. Under the proposals as I understand them, someone need put forward only a general description of what is intended and will not have to spell out details such as the closure of footpaths and other means of access. Many sleepy little harbours are the subject of development. Some people are very keen to develop marinas or waterside residential property. The people who are most attracted to such developments are often not as sympathetic to traditional rights of way as the people who previously used the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is determined to remove the need for private Bills to deal with such harbours he should assure us that he is also determined to protect the rights of people who use harbours for recreation, such as walking, bird watching, or boating with small boats. Under the new procedures proper notice should be given and people should have proper opportunities to object if they believe that any of the traditional rights will be violated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
The Minister is in some difficulty with what I call traditional rights, because in many such places there is the right that is provided for in the original legislation, but there is also the custom and practice that have been established over many years. There was a long battle in the House on the Yarmouth ports provision, where the modern use of the port was clearly incompatible with people walking along the waterfront to watch shipping and the unloading of boats on the river. It is natural for people to want to watch other people working, but the running of a modern port is not necessarily compatible with people standing around watching or walking through the port. The Minister must accept that there were considerable problems, which were eventually resolved— satisfying, I hope, the safety of Yarmouth and the rights of the people who follow the tradition of going down to the waterside. Potential difficulties exist and we must ensure that the correct balance is achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps because there are so many local Acts, and there have been so many problems with them, the Department was not aware of all the difficulties of the harbour revision orders as it was of some of the other problems in the legislation. I hope that the Government will be especially willing to accept some of the amendments to schedule 3 to ensure that local people are given all the information that they need to object to any of the changes that may result from the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) mentioned that we are going to come to the amendments to schedule 3. I wish to make several points and I hope that when we have finished debating them, the hon. Gentleman will have been reassured that some of his concerns will be dealt with by amendments that I may recommend in the debate on schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). Clause 57 may give the Committee a sense of déjà vu, because it is similar to clause 48 and the schedule linked to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what the Minister said about his being prepared to accept amendments, I hope that further concessions will be extracted from him and that he will deal with our concern that the protection given under the harbour revision order is not nearly as extensive as it appears that it will be from other aspects of the work under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>(1) This section applies to the power contained in section 14 above and in paragraph 7A of Schedule 2 to this Act to make a harbour revision order which has the effect of closing or diverting a footpath or bridleway.

I have a letter from the Minister which resulted from a parliamentary question that I asked. It was a straightforward question that sought to obtain from the Department a list of harbours as denned in section 57 of the Harbours Act 1964.1 have to tell the Committee that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
it demanded considerable persistance on my part, following the reply to my parliamentary question to get the extensive list of 600 or so harbours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend visited them all yet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have not, but I am sure that I will eventually be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have moved the amendment because no one, least of all the Department of Transport, has any idea of what is happening, locally and nationally, about footpaths or bridleway diversions. It may be useful for the Committee to know that a previous parliamentary question that I tabled, asking for details of the number of the diversions agreed under the harbour revision order, prompted a response from the Minister that two such diversions have been agreed—wrongly agreed, it seems to me. The Department of Transport is taking numerous steps that cannot be justified. The issue has not been dealt with properly and no one knows what anybody else is doing. We shall end up with two different procedures which will make nonsense of the Bill. Clause 3 says that harbour revision orders should be used by promoters if they wish to have works authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 130 is designed to ensure that when a harbour revision order seeks to divert a footpath or bridleway, the order shall contain basic information such as a description of the path or way that it seeks to extinguish. In the case of a diversion, it should contain a description of the new path or way which the order will create as an alternative, with details of the width of the new path or way and a plan showing the paths. That detail is no more and no less than that required in other legislation which authorises the closure or diversion of footpaths and bridleways. We do not see why harbours should be treated differently. I hope that the Minister will consider our concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 131 is linked to the proposal in paragraph 5(2) of the schedule to enable harbour revision orders to divert or close footpaths and bridleways. I refer to my list of 600 harbours that we know exist in England, Scotland and Wales. No maps show the extent of the land which falls within the boundaries of those harbours. Therefore, local authorities and footpath and bridleway users cannot identify footpaths and bridleways that might be subject to the powers sought by the Bill. The amendment would introduce a preliminary stage which would require the Secretary of State to direct that the power to divert footpaths and bridleways be applied to a particular harbour and, in so doing, to make available, particularly to local authorities concerned, a map showing the footpaths and bridleways to which the power might be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a map would give local authorities a warning that the harbour authority could well have plans to promote diversions or closures of the path. Forewarned is forearmed and local people and local authorities would have the opportunity to register their views. For those reasons amendment No. 131 is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 would put into the procedural requirements for harbour revision orders a requirement to ensure that local authorities, interested parties and members of the public know that when there is a proposal in such an order to extinguish or divert a footpath or bridleway, detailed commitments are made to important issues. It would ensure that a public notice of the proposed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
order describes the path or way to be affected, that a copy of the notice is put up with a plan showing the effect of the order and that a copy of the notice, draft order and plan are served on the local authorities which are defined as including parish councils in England and community councils in Wales. We are extending local authorities' concern down to local level which parish or community councils represent. The amendment also ensures that a copy of the notice, draft order and plan is served on any other persons or bodies prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. That would enable those prescribed to have the opportunity to make representations. Our proposals are not very different from ones made in town and country planning legislation and the Highways Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard my comments and those made by my hon. Friend on the clause stand part debate, I hope that the Minister and the Department realise how much they have failed to take on board these important issues and we can hear that the Minister has a commitment to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could refer to new clause 11, which is grouped with the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley). I am surprised that professional advice has elevated this modest proposal to the status of a new clause. I hope that it will find favour with my hon. Friend, whether as a new clause or as an amendment to the Bill. I think I heard the hon. Lady suggest that there was no reason for treating harbours differently. I apologise if I paraphrase her wrongly, but the point is basically fair. That is the point behind the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the Bill contains amendments to the Highways Act which provide for footpaths and bridleways that cross railways to be stopped up or diverted where it appears to a county or district council that that is expedient in the interests of safety. The new clause would extend those new powers so that they would also apply where a footpath or bridleway crosses harbour land that is used for carrying out harbour operations. The effect would be that a county or district council could make orders stopping up or diverting footpaths crossing harbour land. Those powers could be exercisable only in the interests of public safety. In other words, the new clause puts harbours on the same basis as railways. That is a perfectly logical proposition and I hope that it will find favour with my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward, as does the hon. Lady, to hearing his more general comments on how we can ensure that adequate planning procedures are applied to all harbour revision orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say straight away that I fully appreciate that ramblers and other footpath users are concerned that the provision in schedule 3 dealing with the use of a harbour revision order for the closure or diversion of a right of way over a footpath or bridleway might allow a widespread withdrawal of existing rights of way, for example, along coastal paths and create inconvenience for local people who use footpaths in harbour areas. I know of no such intention by the ports industry and my Department would not look at all favourably on proposals of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
The reference to footpaths was included in the Bill in response to the reference in paragraph 59 of the report of the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure that it had been told that
	<br><q><p>"it would be outside the scope of an order to make an incidental provision for footpath diversion".</p></q>
Harbour revision orders have in fact been used for the diversion of footpaths—for example, the Blyth Harbour Revision Orders 1989. To answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, in the end the objections were withdrawn. But we wanted to clarify the matter. Dealing first with amendment No. 131, I appreciate that hon. Members may feel that what we have is too open-ended and I am considering a revision of what is in the Bill on footpaths in harbours to make it clear that the footpath closure or diversion powers have to be closely related to specific harbour-related developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harbour revision orders are applied for by harbour authorities and it is up to the harbour authority to make all relevant information available. The maintenance of a map showing public rights of way in an area is the statutory responsibility of the surveying authority, generally speaking the county highway authority, in England and Wales. The pattern of footpaths in the harbour area as a whole is not of any direct relevance when considering a specific proposal in relation to identified harbour operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unreasonable to impose on Ministers an obligation to keep registers and maps containing information of footpaths in harbours covering the coastline when in fact the keeping of maps of public rights of way is a local responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 is intended to ensure that footpath users and all the local authorities in the area are fully informed about any proposal in a harbour revision order to close or divert a right of way over a footpath or bridleway. I entirely agree that this is a reasonable and realistic objective on the relatively infrequent occasions when this power might be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be possible under the procedures in schedule 3 to the Harbours Act 1964 for the relevant Minister to direct that notice be served on the local authorities and an advertisement put out about the line of the path affected, but I accept that that does not give the interested parties any certainty that it will happen in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim is to make clear how any such proposal is to be notified and advertised locally to bring the procedure more closely in line with that in the existing statutory procedures in schedule 6 to the Highways Act 1980, and to ensure that the advertisement and notification give sufficient information for footpath users and the local authorities to see how they are affected and to have every opportunity to register objections within the six-week period allowed for in the Harbours Act 1964.

I understand that the Minister wants the proposal to fit in with the harbour revision orders.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 130 would require a harbour revision order, which extinguished or diverted a right of way over a footpath or bridleway, to include a description of any path or way closed or diverted and any new path or way, and to annex a map giving that information. An HRO is a statutory instrument that must be expressed as clearly as possible. If there is any uncertainty about what is stated in the draft order, it is open to anyone to object when the application is advertised. Moreover, I am considering how best to ensure that local authorities and footpath users get every opportunity to see what is proposed at the time the application for the order is advertised, on the lines of the provisions in schedule 6 to the Highways Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I intend to table amendments to clarify the circumstances in which an HRO may provide for a foootpath closure or diversion and to amend the procedures to ensure that interested persons and bodies are fully informed about any proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 11 seeks to extend the scope of the new sections 118A and 119A to the Highways Act 1980 so that they would apply also to harbour authorities in connection with the operational use of harbour land in the same way as they will apply to railways. I made it abundantly clear that we regard the railways as a special case because of the safety hazards posed by trains, especially those travelling at speeds in excess of 100 mph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the changes in operating practice that have been introduced in our harbours in recent years. However, I am bound to say that that does not add up to a case for making the ports industry a special case or for applying to ports the amendments that we proposed in respect of railways when it comes to the stopping up or diversion of footpaths. We will discuss footpaths in harbour areas under schedule 3. I simply say at this stage that there is no reason why harbour authorities, in common with other industrial and commercial developments, should not rely generally on the procedures in sections 118 and 119 of the Highways Act 1980 for the stopping up or diversion of footpaths across harbour land, except where the closure or diversion is an intrinsic part of a harbour development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the assurances I have given, I hope that Opposition Members will feel able to withdraw their amendment, and in view of the special reasons for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
amendments to the Highways Act in schedule 2 in relation to railways, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham will agree not to press his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not disagree with what the Minister said about new clause 11, but I am disappointed that we have not pressed him far enough on amendments Nos. 130, 131 and 132. I am always pleased to see the Minister moving some way towards us, so I am pleased that he has at least recognised that there must be a general procedure for dealing with diversions. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish emphasised that we want a procedure for the entire network that is consistent, whether it applies to harbours, pathways or bridleways. Any progress towards alignment is an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to whether it would be reasonable either for him or for the Secretary of State to require local authorities to produce maps. When he prepares further amendments for Report, will he consider requiring not only the local authority involved but the harbour authority to compile a plan showing the paths in its area of operations? When we were considering the Committee stage of the Ports Act 1991, it was clear that the Government were considering privatising ports without knowing where the boundaries of the ports and harbours were. I am thinking especially of the port of Tilbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong case for requiring the harbour authorities to compile plans, so that at least we would know where the rights of way and paths were, and we would not be in this confusing position. As with the railways, it is clear that the Government do not know which paths will be affected by the proposals relating to areas covered by the Harbours Act 1964.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has mentioned the port of Tilbury. One of the features of the ports legislation, which was demonstrated by the Minister's inability to reply on the Floor of the House, is that the boundaries of the port of Tilbury could be anywhere on the tidal Thames.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rights of way, is my hon. Friend aware that the London Docklands development corporation has inadvisedly applied the extinguishment of rights of way to the docks of the former Port of London authority, even before any application for development of the land over which those rights of way go has been obtained? I think that that illustrates the point that my hon. Friend is very properly making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made the point well and it needs no further clarification from me. I intend to withdraw the amendment, but I believe that it is important for the Minister to take on board the lessons that have been learnt from the port of Tilbury mess, as well as the fact that the Ramblers Association, in particular, feels strongly that the current procedure needs modification. Unless the Minister comes back with clear proposals on Report, we shall end up with legislation that is by no means comprehensive and that introduces different procedures for closures and diversions of footpaths and bridleways, depending on whether they are within or outside a harbour. As that inconsistency is unacceptable, I urge the Minister to come back with suitable proposals on Report after considering our points further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments represent my attempt to have a second bite of the cherry. Virtually identical amendments were moved during the Committee stage of the Ports Act 1991. Then, I said that there was no reason why the Government, who are, sensibly, committed to environmental protection, should reject the amendments that were being considered by Standing Committee D on 7 March 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that occasion, the Government gave reasons for not accepting the proposed environmental and conservational duties. One reason for rejecting an amendment, which had the full support of the RSPB and the National Trust, was that it would create an unlevel playing field and that it would be wrong to give the rivatised trust ports environmental duties of that sort, when the ports that were already in the private sector, such as the Associated British Ports, did not have such responsibilities. At the time, we were unhappy about accepting what the Minister said. Now we have another opportunity to reintroduce those amendments and the Minister cannot say that, if the Government accept the amendments, they will be giving different treatment to different harbours. It is clear that this is the right piece of legislation on which to hang those environmental duties. For that reason alone, I urge the Minister to accept the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed the issue during the passage of the Ports Bill in March of last year. We shall now see—depending on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
the Minister's decision in the next few days in respect of Tees and Hartlepool port and, thereby, in respect of all the other ports that are under the hammer for privatisation —considerable pressure being put on the privatised ports to move away from operational functions in favour of non-operational use. That is one area in which they will seek to maximise profits, and that will put greater pressure on the port and harbour areas. It is more important than ever that the Committee should approve the environmental duties contained in the amendments. The National Trust is worried about our maritime heritage. One of its principal aims is the protection of some 520 coastal miles of great beauty; land that is important to plant, animal and marine life. It is doing great work with the "Enterprise Neptune" appeal. If we do not introduce environmental duties now, we shall be in danger of not being able to introduce environmental protection measures at all. The legislation to privatise the trust ports puts that under greater threat than ever before. Rather than go into detail about why harbours do not have the development controls that are provided in other planning legislation, I shall give the Minister an opportunity to show that he has finally understood the argument that if environmental duties can relate to other industries, they can relate to harbours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it strange that we are discussing the environmental concerns of harbour authorities, yet we do not class harbours as an industry. Tight environmental controls are imposed on industry, but they do not apply to harbours. I have in mind the uncontrolled dredging that has been happening for many years. In the Mersey estuary dredging used to be uncontrolled—it is controlled now—and that altered the coastline. Around Poole, also, areas have been destroyed and the coastline altered. When marinas are built—we are in the period of marinas—there is always surplus land around habours. There is no directive on that surplus land and planning permission is given for uncontrolled development, even though the land around harbours is always a great environmental resource. There is no balance between development and conservation. SSSIs could offer protection, but they are few and far between within harbour areas. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well remember the arguments, or discussions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, I well remember the arguments made against similar amendments to the Ports Act. I am inclined to refer the hon. Lady to my comments on 3 March last year, but that would not be treating the Committee fairly. I shall explain the Government's position, although I must make it clear that it is not just an attempt to stop the duties applying only to privatised ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 103 would insert a new section into the Harbours Act 1964, placing a duty on the Minister when making a harbour order to have regard to the conservation of natural beauty, flowers and animals as well as to the buildings and sites of archaeological, architectual, or historic interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike amendment No. 103, amendment No. 104 is in no way dependent on an application for a harbour order by a harbour authority. It seeks to impose a general environmental and conservation duty on harbour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
authorities in connection with any of their activities, and in their day-to-day management under their existing powers and duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 103 would impose a duty on Ministers which, by dint of the EC directive on environmental impact assessments and its associated regulations, they already have. Where a harbour authority wishes to carry out works for which an HRO or HEO is necessary, the Harbour Works (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1988 lay down that the Secretary of State should determine whether the project falls within the EC directive on environmental assessments—example, if it authorises the creation of a new harbour or additional works in an existing harbour—and is likely to have significant environmental effects. If the project falls within annex II of the directive, the Secretary of State has to decide whether an environmental statement has to be prepared; in the case of works in annex I, there is no such discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where one is necessary, the harbour authority prepares an environmental statement in the form required by the directive. The statement is made available, together with information about the application for the order, and it is open to anyone to inspect the details and to make representations to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is required to take into account that statement and any environmental information presented at an inquiry or otherwise when forming a view on the order. Similar requirements are imposed by the Harbour Works (Assessment of Environmental Effects) (No. 2) Regulations 1989 on harbour authorities for works below low watermark which are not part of the harbour order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is already open to objectors to make representations on such issues as conservation when an HRO or HEO is applied for and advertised, provided that their objection is relevant to the maters dealt with in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do people know that they are entitled to make those objections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for objections on those particular issues to be given disproportionate weight in considering an HRO or HEO, compared with objections that might properly be made to the order from other interests using the harbour or from people who would be affected directly by the consequences of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 103 is not in the same form as the directive. We have been through that point before on amendment No. 53, but I remind the Committee that it is a Euro sin to paraphrase the requirements of a directive when transposing it into national procedures. Regulations, not primary legislation, are the best means of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 104 is a recipe for confusion about what the harbour authority is supposed to do beyond complying with its established statutory requirements. It also seems to be a recipe for litigation and judicial reviews. Moreover, it is not the purpose of the Bill to impose general duties on the harbour authorities. I remind hon. Members that the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment is currently looking at the question of coastal policy as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as if the ports industry is particularly free of controls over the way environmental issues are safeguarded and the interests of conservation protected. I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
mentioned already the regulations dealing with the assessment of environmental effects. On conservation, Ministers are already required under countryside legislation to have regard to the desirability of conserving the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 give protection to buildings and sites of architectural, archaeological and historic interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harbour authorities, like other landowners, are required under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to notify English Nature or the equivalent bodies elsewhere of any developments affecting a site of special scientific interest. There are statutory controls under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 in connection with listed buildings consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to operational matters, the ports industry is subject to the same environmental constraints as other enterprises. For example, in connection with the disposal of dredged sediment there is legislation under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. There is further legislation regulating pollution from ships, the requirements of the National Rivers Authority in connection with marine pollution within coastal waters, and a whole raft of statutes and regulations made under statutes that govern the environmental aspects of day-to-day operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I have to question why the port industry should be specially singled out by having such a general duty imposed on it, when no similar duty is placed on industrial and commercial concerns generally. That is especially pertinent, bearing in mind that more than half the ports industry by tonnage is in the private sector. I know that similar provisions have been incorporated in several recent Acts, such as the Water Act 1989. Those statues affect the power and duties and the regulation of developments by industries whose activities can have a major impact on the environment—for example, opencast coal mining or access to large catchment areas for reservoirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary function of the harbour authority is to provide a harbour that can be safely and conveniently used and to provide passenger or cargo-handling facilities or enable them to be provided by others. It is better to build on the framework of the controls that are already in place than to try to tackle the problem by imposing new duties as in amendment No. 104, which are not sufficiently precise to secure any real benefit to the environment or to conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, we must strike a proper balance in reaching a view on HROs or HEOs as on other matters and I do not accept that any useful purpose would be served by amendment No. 103, which overlaps with existing duties. Anybody wishing to lodge an objection can do so because the HRO is advertised and made available for inspection along with the environmental impact assessment, where one is needed. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That last comment is not satisfactory. Presumably, the Minister decides when an environmental impact assessment is needed; the general public cannot make that decision. Legislation should make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
such requirements plain. People should not have to search through the provisions in detail, nor through the measures laid down in EC directives and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I really want the Minister to examine is the effect upon the 100 or so ports in this country—that is a generous assessment—that are significant commercial ventures in terms of import and export. The regulations cover about 600 harbours. If another 100 are of significance as fishing ports, that means that about 400 ports have no important function. The Minister may dispute those figures, and he may consider that the proportion of functioning ports is larger. However, the point is that there are about 300 ports whose sole function is as part of the leisure industry. They may be used for pleasure boating, recreational fishing, bird watching or walking holidays. The amendments would protect such ports, and the Minister should recognise that. I am worried by the common practice in recent years of using such ports for speculative development. Such developments may involve marinas, holiday accommodation, or the import or export of a particular range of goods. Often, buildings are erected on a speculative basis to accommodate a silo or some similar structure. That can spoil the character of the area, and a former beauty spot is left as an eyesore when the commercial reason for the activity disappears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that the Minister said persuaded me that the Bill would protect the 300 or so little ports that could be subject to harbour revision orders. The public believe that such ports should be protected as places for peaceful leisure and that they should not be converted into industrial ports for a few years, at the cost of considerable environmental damage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said is as incomprehensible as his remarks last year in relation to what is now the Ports Act 1991. I wonder whether, deprived of his brief, he would understand the importance of the environmental issues that are being discussed—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not sure whether you, Mr. Latham, heard those remarks from the Conservative Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham), who remarked on the "impertinence" of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, has in his constituency more little sleepy ports that need environmental protection than most other hon. Members. The people in his area may find it odd that he has contributed nothing constructive. Perhaps he considers that his duties as the Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary are so important that he should not speak up for his constituents. I imagine that people on the north Norfolk coast will be disappointed that he has not spoken up for the environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it to the constituents of the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) to evaluate what my hon. Friend has just said. I am sure that opportunities will arise for his comments to be heard by them, and they can then make their own assessment of their Member of Parliament's interest, or lack of interest, in environmental issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has presented us with an important opportunity to improve environmental safeguards. It is now obvious that we shall not grasp that opportunity. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
Minister almost hides behind EC directives which, in the past, have exposed the Government's lack of concern for environmental protection. It is difficult to understand why he ignores the opportunity to improve environmental safeguards. The Minister claimed that the amendments were a recipe for litigation and judicial review, but when we discussed earlier amendments to include guidelines in the Bill that would be used to prevent judicial review, he rejected them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Trust has made it clear that it is worried about the lack of environmental safeguards on the activities of harbour authorities. The Opposition believe that the Bill is deficient, given the potential damage to the coastal zone made possible by the trust ports legislation. Some provisions in the Bill and in the Ports Act 1991 give rise to the prospect of further developments that would complicate matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning controls do not cover all aspects of harbour development or improvement works. That was made clear recently when we debated the levy on the disposal of land that was relevant to operational and non-operational leases. Planning controls do not cover all those issues. That is partly due to the special powers conferred on harbours by the orders, which the Bill amends. It is appropriate to ensure that the Bill incorporates environmental considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admitted that planning controls did not usually operate below watermark. The 1988 environmental assessment regulations are a useful gauge of the potential effects of harbour works on the local environment. However, they do not act as barriers to potentially damaging developments. We are worried about potentially damaging developments because they will increase, yet the Government ignore them and fail to provide proper environmental controls. Other industries have provided those controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the issue to a vote, because other hon. Members who cannot participate in our proceedings might consider those environmental issues important and wish to press the matter later, possibly on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

This amendment has reappeared in a more orderly form than was previously suggested. It would be preferable if my hon.

I hope that it will be interpreted as constructive and technical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the principle behind my hon. Friend's amendment. It would be helpful to applicants for harbour orders if they were able to seek the necessary FEPA licence with the draft order. However, I fear that it will be necessary to carry out a thorough review of the procedures for harbour orders under schedule 3 of the Harbours Act 1964 in order to achieve what my hon.

Friend's amendment seeks to achieve. In particular, we need a provision similar to that in clause 15 dealing with concurrent proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Bill is not the right vehicle for achieving all of that, and it would, in any event, be better to await the outcome of the DTI's deregulation review which I mentioned in the discussion on clause 19 last Thursday. That review is likely to recommend a number of measures designed to streamline administrative procedures which, in turn, would result in legislative changes —for example, to the Harbours Act 1964.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can give us an example of what could and what could not be done if the amendment were agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. Paragraph (3)(c) of schedule 2 to the Harbours Act 1964 provides that one of the objects for which a harbour revision order may be made is to vary the regulatory powers of the harbour authority in connection with work carried out by operators and others in and around the harbour. The paragraph refers to the regulation of harbour operations carried on by others. The amendment substitutes the words "activities relating to harbours" for "harbour operations".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that is that the expression "harbour operations" as defined in section 57(1) of the 1964 Act does not cover the full range of harbour-related activities over which it may be desirable for a harbour authority to exercise regulatory control—for example, in connection with the provision of ancillary services. In addition, the amendment, taken together with paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the 1964 Act, makes it clear—in case there is any doubt—that a harbour revision order can contain provisions dealing with the licensing by the harbour authority of works and dredging to be carried out by other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the changes that the Minister proposes extend the definition of harbour operations? Will harbours now be more likely to undergo renewal and development?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I am extending the definition, but it may be appropriate for me to write to the hon. Lady to clarify the position and to reassure her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is closely related to the provision in clause 57(2), which amends section 37 of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966 in the same way by substituting the term "activities relating to harbours" for "harbour operations".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 38, line 34, leave out from 'that' to 'and' in line 35 and insert
	<br><q><p>'the extinguishment of the path or way is expedient on the ground that it is unnecessary, or, as the case may be, that its diversion will make the path or way nearer or more commodious to the public;'.</p></q>
This is a probing amendment. We aim to change the ground for making a diversion or for the extinguishment of a footpath or bridleway by means of a harbour revision order. The amendment is based on the Highways Act 1980 and is intended to achieve consistency in the way in which such matters are dealt with. The current position is unclear. The Bill does not make clear whether the Minister will give equal attention to whether
	<br><q><p>"no significant use is made of the footpath"</p></q>
or
	<br><q><p>"a suitable alternative is available".</p></q>
Do those circumstances apply equally to extinguishment and diversion orders or is one test more appropriate than the other? We need clarification. The amendment proposes an alternative way of ensuring consistency when dealing with diversion or extinguishment orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

circumstances in which the proposal for a footpath closure or diversion could be included in a HRO. Where it is appropriate to use that procedure, an important question for the relevant Minister is whether there is a suitable alternative or, if not, whether the harbour authority will provide one. I shall bear the hon. Lady's comments in mind when I consider this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister talks of making progress, it makes me think that the general election will be soon.

This is purely a drafting amendment. Paragraph (6) deals with the application of special parliamentary procedure to harbour orders. It removes some words and substitutes others. The words "the order" would be repeated and the amendment corrects that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Third schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not long ago I was speaking to a colleague in the House and he said, "The trouble with you Nigel, is that you do not trust any Government." I said, "Well, if you'd been in the House as long as I have, nor would you." It is the job of any Opposition or, indeed, any hon. Member when matters are not of party-political importance—and notionally this Bill is not—to examine legislation and consider what its effects might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
Hon. Members may recall that in our earlier discussions on principles I said that although I am actively engaged in matters relating to the Port of London authority—the biggest port in the country—I was completely unaware of the fact that the statutes on the governing of that public authority, although entrenched in the 1948 Act, were changed by a harbour revision order. Until now, harbour revisions orders have been fairly well set out in the 1964 Act. It is not a convention that the first part of a Bill deals with the principle powers? We are supposed to know the reason for a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in looking through this Bill the reference to what we have been discussing is, as the Minister said earlier, contained in clause 3(2). In respect of waterways, harbours and so on, it states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State shall not make an order under this section if in his opinion the primary object of the order could be achieved by means of an order under the Harbours Act 1964."</p></q>
Unlike me, a casual reader of that provision who belonged to the profession might know all about the Harbours Act 1964. However, my argument about schedule 3, which is carried by the meaning of clause 57, is that the Act will be completely transformed by the two magic lines in clause 57(1), which state:
	<br><q><p>"The Harbours Act 1964 shall have effect with the amendments set out in Schedule 3".</p></q>
We are now discussing schedule 3, so if we want to know what the Bill will do to the Harbours Act 1964, we would have to have a pretty good working knowledge of that Act, as amended by various statutes. We would then have to go through schedule 3 line by line. I suggest that the terms and amendments under that schedule will fundamentally change the purpose of section 14 of the Harbours Act 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Harbours Act was a useful means under which techniques and requirements, about which everyone knew, could be changed and under which the Secretary of State for Transport, or his predecessor, the president of the Board of Trade, could, by statutory instruments, update the governing of a port. However, the Act contained an important safeguard about the extent to which a statutory instrument could be used. Section 14(2)(b) of the 1964 Act states that the Minister cannot make an order
	<br><q><p>"unless the appropriate Minister is satisfied that the making of the order is desirable in the interests of securing the improvement, maintenance or management of the harbour in an efficient and economical manner or of facilitating the efficient and economic transport of goods or passengers by sea."</p></q>
That was the scope of any order that could be made under section 14 of the Harbours Act 1964. The Act is known principally for that power. However, for the purposes of the Bill, schedule 3 blows that power sky high. The Minister will explain—I have no quarrel with him about it—that he is simply making it possible for what was a statutory instrument under the 1964 Act to contain anything that might be contained in a private harbour Bill. Indeed, reference is made in the notes on clauses with regard to clause 57 to the Select Committee's investigations. It found that many harbour authorities promoted private Bills to enable them to operate outside the scope of the then legislation and thus prevent being questioned in the courts, instead of their using the facilities under the Harbours Act 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That apparently convenient, although sometimes obscure, harbour instrument provision will be enlarged
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
almost without any limits being set. Indeed, if its purpose is to replace a potential harbours Act, the powers under section 14 of the Harbours Act 1964, which will still stand, will be almost without limit. I put forward that thesis which, to the best of my knowledge, is correct. I hope that in a brief reply the Minister, with his knowledge of the Bill and perhaps with advice, will modify what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1(2) of schedule 3 will amend section 14 of the Harbours Act 1964, adding to the phrase
	<br><q><p>"transport of goods and passengers by sea"</p></q>
the words
	<br><q><p>"or in the interests of the recreational use of sea-going ships".</p></q>
No one will worry about that, but it will be a marine activity ad lib.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further revisions under schedule 3 include giving the power for
	<br><q><p>"(a) the closing of part of the harbour"—</p></q>
but the part could be 80 or 90 per cent.—
	<br><q><p>"(b) a reduction in the facilities available in the harbour, or (c) the disposal of property not required for the purposes of the harbour".</p></q>
Of course, if a harbour is diminished by a half or three quarters, much of its purpose will automatically be diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Curiously enough, the schedule than gives the Minister the power to say that the making of the order is desirable "on grounds other than those specified in that subsection"—referring to subsection 2(b) of the 1964 Act. That means that the Minister is being given an open cheque and the opportunity to write on that cheque whatever he thinks desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not object to the ingenuity of the Bill's drafting. It has been drafted with due economy and skill. However, I doubt whether anyone, except members of the Committee
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
or those who are professionally involved, could disentangle the close and complex drafting of schedule 3. The schedule is not only a schedule to the Bill, but a schedule to the 1964 Act, as amended. However, that Act will not be reprinted; it will be available only in commercial publications such as Halsbury's Laws of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have even more width-giving powers. We know that section 14 will be "for the purposes of"; but under paragraph 1(4)(b) of schedule 3 it will also be "in connection with". That widens the scope even further. The worst aspect is the modification of the repealing powers of the Harbours Act 1964. Under that Act it is possible under the harbour revision order to repeal or amend
	<br><q><p>"any statutory provision of local application affecting the harbour to which the order relates".</p></q>
However, under paragraph 1(4)(c) of schedule 3, the words "repealing and amending" will be replaced by the words
	<br><q><p>"excluding or modifying any provision of any Act or of any instrument made under an Act".</p></q>
So we come back to what was said about the railways—unless the Minister tells me that I have misread it—in that any Act of Parliament presumably can be modified by that rather obscure provision. That is worthy of greater publication and understanding, especially as we then learn from paragraph 1(5) of schedule 3 that any statutory instrument can apply, not merely to a single harbour but to any harbour
	<br><q><p>"maintained or managed by the same harbour authority".</p></q>
