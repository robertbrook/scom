VALUATION TRIBUNALS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 191, in page 9 line 40, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3) Such tribunals shall compile, and the Secretary of State shall publish, anually from 1 April 1994 reports setting out—
<ol>
<li>the numbers of appeals to each tribunal;</li>
<li>the proportion of appeals which were successful; and</li>
<li>an estimate of the average waiting time before appeals were heard, measured at the beginning and end of the financial year concerned.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Due to the generosity of your tea break, Mr. Leadbitter, and the excitement that it caused among some of my hon. Friends, at least one of them has failed to speak to clause 14. He had every intention of enlightening us on the clause, and I was fascinated to find out how he could speak about it for more than 30 seconds. That pleasure now awaits us in respect of another clause.<br><br>
Amendment No. 191 deals with appeals and tribunals. Although it is not a seemly hour to debate such matters, it behoves me to draw the Committee's attention to the important issues on the way in which appeals will be handled. It may not be widely known outside the House of Commons, even to aficionados of the local government press, that people will not know what their house valuation is—they will be aware only of the band in which it has been placed. Their only way of finding out would be to be aggrieved in the belief that if the property's price had been moved by just over £1,000, it might have fallen into a lower band, thereby saving them about £50 in some instances—certainly 16 per cent. of the amount due. Consequently, many people who would otherwise not be worried because they knew the value of the property that had been designated for valuation purposes and were satisfied that all was fair and above board, might decide to appeal.<br><br>
The appeals process is likely to be inundated with people who believe that by issuing the appeal they will be put in a lower band and have to pay less council tax. <i>[Laughter.]</i> I did not realise that I had said anything amusing, Mr. Leadbitter. But whatever it was has obviously tickled the fancy of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman), or perhaps it was something under the table, in which case I would rather not know what it is.<br><br>
In some authorities where the compression of valuations is great, the lower bands take on great
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
significance. In Tameside in greater Manchester and Wigan respectively, 84 per cent. and 74 per cent. of dwellings will be in those two lower bands. People will need to know how close they were, if they are in band B, to being in band A, because it will make a difference to the amount that they will have to pay. There will be many appeals. Many of the appeals from the revaluation undertaken in the non-domestic sector are still being dealt with.<br><br>
The significance of a batch of appeals being made at the same time is the closeness to the due date for the introduction of the property-poll tax or council tax. That could cause administrative chaos. The property banding will not be published until late in the year and the appeals process will begin in January 1993. As a consequence, shortly before the introduction—if the Government get their way—of the council tax or property-poll tax, there will be an avalanche of appeals. There will also be considerable confusion over the discount system, which we shall deal with in later clauses. Those factors will create a hiatus that will add to the confusion caused by the bitter end of the poll tax.<br><br>
There will be a confluence of activity; the poll tax will be grinding to a standstill and the collection rates will be causing chaos for local authorities in terms of liquidity and of the problems of chasing outstanding amounts. Those amounts will by then be a debt crisis of gargantuan proportions that could affect the national borrowing requirement. Local authorities will have to draw on the financial sector in order to pay salaries and meet outstanding debt bills caused by the drying-up of the revenue sector because of the imminent demise of the poll tax and the difficulties of collection.<br><br>
The Government have declined to abolish the 20 per cent. minimum contribution. I expected the Secretary of State to announce with a flourish, during his statement yesterday on the revenue support grant, that, as the Prime Minister had earlier in the afternoon been so proud of the £4 million that the Government—he claimed and I have no reason to doubt him—have allocated to providing extra help in supplementary benefits towards meeting mortgage payments so that people can stay in their dwellings, an equal sum had been found to fund the abolition of the 20 per cent. contribution. That would reduce the administrative chaos. That would in turn help the liquidity and revenue flow of local authorities in the last year of the poll tax, and would ensure that the administrative resources tied up in the collection of the poll tax could be freed to deal with the introduction of the property poll tax or, I hope, of our fair rates proposals.<br><br>
Administrators would be free to deal with the numerous inquiries that they will inevitably receive because of the introduction of the new tax. Those inquiries will come, quite rightly, from the valuation of property. People will ask on what basis they are in band B instead of band A. A property with a takeaway shop next door might be put in band B, but the owner might decide to appeal because he or she feels that the property was worth less because of the takeaway next door. It would be worth less because people in our throw-away society drop litter, make noise and hang about outside, joining in all the late-night revelries that take place outside Chinese and other takeaways. I am sure that if we were now outside in the centre of London we would join in those revelries, having enjoyed, in my case, not a curry, which I cannot stand, but, perhaps a sweet and sour—the sort of thing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0273">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
that we have in Committee—sweet on our side and sour on the Government side or, in the case of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) and his hon. Friends, chop suey and soy sauce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is past their bedtime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not noticed that they had gone. I pay tribute to them for having stayed till the witching hour. That is unusual for Liberal Democrats. Whenever, in recent years, I have served on Committees with them—I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will confirm this—usually, they do not last until lunch time. So we were fortunate that they stayed so long. I understand that they did so because they were waiting for the amendment to be considered to which the hon. Member for Eastbourne spoke for two minutes before midnight. Maybe, we should engineer that trick more often when amendments are tabled by Liberal Democrats. With your agreement, Mr. Leadbitter, we should ensure that they are dealt with last so that we can all enjoy pearls of wisdom of the sort that we were given tonight by the hon. Member for Eastbourne and the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie). The dulcet tones of the hon. Lady will remain with me for the rest of the evening. There are no Liberal Democrats present, but the rest of us are here to enjoy the early hours of the morning.<br><br>
Returning to the appeals process under clause 15 and the valuation of properties, if valuations are carried out from an elevated position, will not the valuer in his hot-air balloon or light aircraft miss the significance of the litter outside one house and the pleasant surroundings of a house that overlooks the local park further along the street?<br><br>
Of course, the people who live opposite the park will be glad to come within the same band as the people who live next door to a takeaway, but the people who live next door to the takeaway will not be so pleased. They and people like them—there will be thousands of dwellings with takeaways next door, and that is enough to cause aggravation—will demand to know how their properties were placed in the same band as the one overlooking the park. Neighbours will agree that they ought to appeal, and someone will talk to his cousin whose house backs on to the gasworks and the cousin will talk to his or her sister-in-law who has discovered that there is a bus stop outside her house.<br><br>
Conservative Members do not always have bus stops outside their houses, and only very rarely have I met a Conservative Member who lived next door to a takeaway. Some of them live in such elevated places that they can invite Brian Walden for lunch and be interviewed at the same time. We are not all in that position. Others of us are lucky to have a detached garage on the side of our semi-detached house. I mention that only to ensure that my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) does not feel left out. The area of my detached garage is less than 25 sq m. It does not house a car because I do not drive one, but it houses my boys' bikes. I presume that it qualifies as a domestic hereditament unless, of course, the boys mend bikes in the garage for other people,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
in which case it could count as a business undertaking. I shall have to give them due warning not to rub down anyone else's bikes but their own.<br><br>
We are dealing with a number of dwellings, all of which have different circumstances. There are sisters-in-law with bus stops outside their houses, and people living next to takeaways or gasworks—I appreciate that there are not many gasworks left. The chairman of British Gas has gas lights, barbecues and very expensive gas implements around and inside his house and curtilages. That is because he has been given what I believe amounts to some £25,000 of gas equipment to try out, free of charge.<br><br>
12.45 am<br><br>
I do not know, Mr. Leadbitter, whether you have a gas barbecue outside your home, lit by an ancient gas lamp, all free of charge from British Gas. All I know is that the rest of us pay for such equipment through the nose. The people in the hot air gas balloon, unless they have photographic equipment of the calibre of that used by the CIA or by our friends in MI6—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Gas-fired cameras.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggests that they will need gas-fired cameras to be able to pinpoint the increased value of the house of the chairman of British Gas. I am sure that Mr. Evans will write to me about that in due course, but his property may well not be in band H. If it is not noticed that he has all those increased valuation attributes in his curtilage, or if, as the Bill seems to indicate, those attributes are not to be taken into account during the valuation of his property, he may find himself in band G.<br><br>
However, neighbours down the road, who do not have those free benefits because they do not work for British Gas, might have a slightly larger house. The valuers might assess their house as being more valuable and put it in band H. A neighbour might appeal on the ground that his house's surroundings are less luxurious and that the valuers were not able to see the fittings inside Mr. Evans' home because they merely passed in front of the house and placed a tick in a box. He might claim that a proper valuation was not performed. The neighbour will know that his circumstances are not as good and his position not as advantageous as those of the person who has been placed in the lower band G.<br><br>
That is the problem. The people on the bottom will complain that they are not close enough to the bottom, while those at the top will envy those who are nearly at the top but whose dwelling is worth more. Those in the second position will say that if the valuers had been able to examine the house more closely and get a good look through the bedroom window they would have seen how much the luxurious bedrooms and their attached en suite facilities resembled the setting of a Jilly Cooper book, in which baths fill with hot water at the flick of a switch and never overflow because an automatic mechanism shuts off the taps at just the right time to preserve the ceilings of the rooms below.<br><br>
The valuers will never know about such things. They will copy Santa Claus and pass over the roof, taking a quick glance down the chimney—if a chimney is still needed in the centrally heated, gas-fired dwelling of those lucky enough to enjoy such benefits free, gratis and for nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There we have it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite so. I agree with the Minister, perhaps for the only time between now and 2 am. I am glad that we have established a baseline, and that we all agree that there will be mass appeals under the valuation system.<br><br>
I would not have gone into such detail tonight had my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) been in the Room to speak about clause 14. He has been forgiven for that, however, and is in his place. That is good news, because I am sure that he will join in the debate on clause 15.<br><br>
I would go stark raving crackers if I did not adopt a light tone at this time of the morning, Mr. Leadbitter, but there is a serious point behind what I have said. There will be thousands of appeals. People will be aggrieved about the band that they are in, they will not be certain that the valuation of their premises has been undertaken properly, they will not understand why they are in a different band from other people and they will want to know the exact basis on which the decision was taken. If they exercise their right to appeal, mayhem could result at the same time that local government goes all out to abolish the poll tax and introduce the new tax.<br><br>
Appeal panels will have to cope with the problems. They will need information from those who will undertake the valuations, which will place enormous strain on the Inland Revenue. Local government will give what information it has about properties to the appeals panels, as is suggested in the notes on clauses. I thought of reading out the notes on clauses verbatim to the Committee, but I assume that hon. Members will read them, so I spare you from that ordeal, Mr. Leadbitter.<br><br>
The Government do not seem to know what they are letting themselves in for with the council tax. We have pointed out the problems with the poll tax, but the same problems will arise for the council tax. Here we go again. Those problems include: The amount of money allocated to deal with the appeals process; the number of appeals panels and the frequency with which they will sit; the snarling up of the system; the aggravation that that will cause; and the regrettable fact that people will draw the system into disrepute which, in turn, involves an unacceptable attitude towards payment of the tax. With a proper valuation, which people understand, although they may not always like it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned valuation tribunals. In west Yorkshire, after the revaluation of commercial properties, there were about 23,000 outstanding appeals. If, in an area of low rateable property values, maisonettes and bungalows that are valued at between £15,000 and £18,000, were placed in the same band as a semi-detached house that is valued at £40,000, there would be many appeals. It would be difficult to explain why people should not appeal. What will the Government do to ease that problem for valuation tribunals? It would take years to deal with it through the appeals system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has cut, like a knife through butter, to the core of the amendment. The Government will need to know how many appeals are involved, and the time that appeals will take. In comparison with domestic properties, there were few commercial revaluations in west Yorkshire, but 23,000 appeals are still outstanding there.<br><br>
Suppose that those difficulties were multiplied across the country. There could be a tide of appeals that would overwhelm all those involved, and that could accelerate. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
grievances were allowed to fester, others could be encouraged to believe that they should join the queue of people wishing to appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the long delays in appeals being heard. As far as I gather, however, he speaks only of valuation appeals. There could be appeals on other matters, such as discounts. The Government have said nothing about which sort of appeal should take priority if there are the delays described by my hon. Friend. Surely the Government should give the Committee that information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that before the night or the coming day is out we shall receive enlightenment on these issues—new enlightenment, as the phrase went two or three years ago before the counter-revolution set in. Under that new enlightenment, we shall no doubt hear, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton rightly says, how the Government will deal with appeals on the allocation of a discount. Perhaps we shall be told the relationship between discount and valuation appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks of discounts being turned down. Is it perhaps a case of the reasons also being invisible let alone the people involved being invisible according to the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulties that lie with the invisibility of those who are entitled to status discounts could perhaps be compounded by the length of time that tribunals take to rule on such matters. For example, a tribunal may start ruling on a matter when a person begins his degree course and still be trying to get to grips with it when that person has retired from work. It is a serious issue; it could be years before all such appeals are dealt with, by which time a person may have moved on to another employment or status or even to a different household, and may have started a new appeals process on his new dwelling. He might…</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: God bless the hon. Lady!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the hon. Gentleman keeps complaining about what he calls the property poll tax. Is he really worried about a hybrid tax? If so, what about the unbearable perplexities of his party's proposals?<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman may be anxious, and properly so, about the delays in appeal procedures, about people moving house and the great rolling train of mobility in today's world. But what about the difficulty of appeals against the four different types of valuation in which the so-called fair rates system would result? The appeals would mount up in an unbearable way; people would probably appeal against appeal against appeal in a way that the hon. Gentleman has probably not even anticipated. It is clear to me that the fair rates system will never materialise, so nobody is worried about the knock-on effect of appeals, and so on. However, our system will be introduced; it will be sound, sane, simple and effective. I share the hon. Gentleman's anxieties about appeals, but I do not believe that they will be as bad as he fears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention. I assure the hon. Lady that her incisive critique of our fair rates will prove to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
unfounded. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham will confirm, we do not intend to have four different valuations. There will be one valuation, taking into account the usual factors needed to make a sensible and relevant valuation of a property.<br><br>
1 am<br><br>
There will be a graduated rateable value—a rateable value is the basis of any sensible property tax.<br><br>
We shall supply people with the reason for the valuation when they receive the rateable value of their property; thus they will have information if they wish to appeal. Under the proposed property poll tax, they will not know the reasons for their property being placed in a particular band unless they appeal. That is the crunch of the debate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be so generous as to inform residents of the different elements that made up the valuation, will he be equally generous with the Committee and tell us now what the weightings of the different elements that compose the single valuation will be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is right that professional valuers should offer their advice on the weighting of factors relevant in a rateable valuation process and on how they will vary in different parts of the country. That is important in ensuring a rates system that is fair to individuals and families, to different local authority areas and to different regions of Britain. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham will confirm, we are clear that the system must take into account different types of property within a district and in different districts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is most generous to give way; he is hurrying through his speech in an attempt to bring his remarks to a conclusion. He has studied the issues carefully and will already have consulted valuers. Will he say what the weightings have emerged so far in those discussions so that we have the best possible idea of how things will work out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is very crafty. Will the hon. Gentleman please answer briefly, because we are discussing the Bill and the amendment. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) should not be too tempted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the protection of the Chair. I realise that the Minister's intervention was mischievous and cheeky but I shall go so far and no further and give him an open and honest answer: the consultations are proceeding apace. When we are in a position to introduce changes to operate our fair rates system we shall have the answers at our fingertips.<br><br>
It would be a pleasure to have the person power and computer facilities that are available to Ministers. I am looking forward to civil servants learning how to write braille so that they can pass me notes at crucial moments to ensure that I get the answers right.<br><br>
There is a device which I do not have at present called a Mountbatten—that shows the sturdiness and forthright-ness of the machine—which can be attached to an electric typewriter. If one types into the electric typewriter the brailer alongside prints it out immediately. I appreciate that we will have to have it fixed up in the corridor but it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
will be entertaining to see people rushing out and typing into it. Had I the resources tonight my hon. Friends could have sent me notes putting me straight during my contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend does not need them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham says extremely nice things about me. He is more than generous. Despite the best efforts of the Minister and the Secretary of State we have a relationship that is the envy of those on the Government Benches. Had they the same sort of working partnership they would not need to pass notes. In fact the Secretary of State would have been with us this morning to give us his pearls of wisdom, particularly his views on the European dimension to these issues.<br><br>
There will doubtless come a time, after Maastricht, of course, when the valuation process will be European-wide. We will appeal to Strasbourg to ascertain whether fairness has been applied over all OECD and EC countries. We all look forward to that process in the distant future. How distant, how future, who knows? Incidentally, the provincial centre at Maastricht will host the discussions. One day perhaps we will have such important regional centres in for example, Wakefield, Barnsley, Cardiff—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Wigan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And even Wigan. In 2100, further discussions on the extension of the European Community, perhaps into Asia or Asia minor, will take place in the Wigan provincial centre. By then some of the appeals from 1993 will just have been heard. Lord willing, as the European Community envelops us all, people will have become so disillusioned with the appeals procedure that they will give up and pay their blasted council tax.<br><br>
That is a vision which if applied on the Walden programme or "On the Record", would have set alight people choking on their Sunday lunch, as many of us do as we watch those programmes. Some of us do not have the facility to invite Brian Walden or Jonathan Dimbleby down to our dwellings for a humble meal at our humble table.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield has been there; Wigan were playing Sheffield Eagles and he came and had a sandwich with me. The problem is that he is a vegetarian and I had got in well cured, thickly cut ham in brown bread. I offered him those sandwiches and he declined them. I had to find eggs to boil to sustain him. We were down to zero temperatures for that Wigan and Sheffield Eagles match which Wigan won. His reminding me of that defeat was quite unnecessary. Sheffield Eagles went down to the second division of the Rugby league as a result. I do not want any more such interventions from my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is the appeals procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded by my hon. Friend that he wishes to speak about the appeals procedure. Who am I to deny him an opportunity? His pearls of wisdom will enlighten the Committee and see us through to 2 o'clock with glad hearts.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I congratulate the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). He is considerably out of order, but his speech was delightful and ingenius. At this time of the morning, it was pleasant to listen to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot follow the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must not stray out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely right.<br><br>
Amendment No. 191 deals with appeals procedures. Appeals tribunals will be known as valuation and council tax tribunals. Everything has an acronym. The acronym for the tribunals would be VCTT—it conjures up an image of a war hero on a motor bike on the Isle of Man. That is not as bad as the acronym for the body set up under the employment legislation to deal with complaints about trade unions. The acronym was CROTUM. When it became a senior commission, it turned into SCROTUM.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me, that organisation had to call itself SCROTUM.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment further on that point. I shall however, consider VCTTs later.<br><br>
We are worried about the appeals procedure—the number of appeals, and delays in tackling them. My hon. Friend the Member for Brightside made that point well. Our anxiety is echoed by the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, which sent a letter to the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton quoted some relevant parts of it in detail. The IRRV also commented on the valuation and council tax tribunals:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned that as the Bill stands, it would appear that there is no requirement for any outstanding amount to be paid while an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal is outstanding. Obviously this would impact significantly on local authorities' cashflow if appeals were not dealt with promptly … It has been suggested that the situation would be alleviated if Tribunals were to be required to process appeals within 28 days of receipt. The Institute believes that this is an unrealistic target. There must be a clear requirement for outstanding amounts to be payable even if an appeal to a Valuation Tribunal is outstanding."</p></blockquote>
The local authority associations have taken a similar line in their discussions with the Department of the Environment. They believe that while an appeal is outstanding, the amount should be paid. I suspect that my colleagues and the local authority associations might not agree with me, and I appreciate their point about the cashflow of local authorities. However, I believe that it is not right that the whole amount should be paid while an appeal is outstanding.<br><br>
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation is right that the appeal should be heard within 28 days. However, the institute describes that prospect as unrealistic. What would the Minister describe it as?<br><br>
If the Minister cannot give a guarantee on the matter, there is a problem about the amounts that are outstanding subject to appeal. It would be unfair to pay the whole amount before an appeal has been heard, unless the sum was repaid, perhaps with interest, in the event of a successful appeal. If an appeal takes from 1993, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside suggested, until 2010 at the EC conference in Wigan, there must be a case for the interest that would have accrued to be added to the sum repaid. I do not wholly agree with the local authorities.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
About three-quarters of the amount should be paid and the other quarter should be decided at the appeal. What does the Minister think?<br><br>
1.15 am<br><br>
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"we are also concerned about the possible very heavy workload for Valuation Tribunals regarding liability appeals. We put forward the view that consideration should be given to having liability apppeals dealt with in the Magistrates' Courts at the enforcement stage; the Institute will be taking further advice on this matter. Whichever body deals with these appeals however, it is important that it is properly resourced in order to undertake the work."</p></blockquote>
That is a good point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point, the Magistrates Association has expressed to the Government, and this Committee, its "deep concern" at the use of magistrates courts at the liability order stage of enforcement. It has done so in respect of the community charge and is giving notice of the same anxiety over the proposed council tax. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, in the light of the association's anxiety, it is astonishing that the Government have not accepted the point and have had nothing to say on it?<br><br>
The Government were speechless on the matter during the long period in which anxiety was expressed about it in respect of the community charge. It is surprising that the Bill does not contain different provisions to deal with the association's problems. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that when people go before magistrates, they expect some form of judicial review of their cases and to be able to provide information about their ability to pay but that, in reality, the court does not allow such matters to be raised? Magistrates are used only to decide whether the processes were right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a long intervention. The hon. Gentleman is not being cut off—he is entitled to the Floor later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Leadbitter. I am sure that you have been amazed, as I have, at interventions that have turned into speeches. I assure you that this is an intervention, not a speech.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) agrees that the "deep concern" of the Magistrates Association should be expressed—and that we expect the Government to act on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I gave way, I was about to pick up a document from the Magistrates Association, which the hon. Gentleman then paraphrased. The Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation wants whichever procedure is used to have proper resources. However, we know that trying to get money out of the Government is like trying to get blood out of a stone. I wonder whether there will be proper resources to finance the appeal system; if not, that will mean enormous delays in the tribunal system and a huge backlog in the courts system. That is why the Magistrates Association is worried. Has the Minister given any thought to the resources that will be needed to run the system properly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear it, but the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill identifies the additional costs of running tribunals as £5 million a year.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
The initial costs are estimated at £15 million. If there are vast numbers of appeals, I wonder whether those figures will be accurate. Presumably, an assessment was made of the possible number of appeals before the figures were given. The Minister should explain those assumptions to the Committee. I suspect that the amounts identified will not be sufficient.<br><br>
In her letter of 20 November, Mrs. J. D. H. Rose, the chairman of the council of the Magistrates Association, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Cohen"—</p></blockquote>
I do not know how the hon. Member for Eastbourne got hold of a copy of such a personal letter—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I got one too, saying "Dear Mr. Bellotti".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing what can be done with word processors these days. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I write to you as a member of the Committee considering the above Bill to express the deep concern felt by the magistracy in respect of their involvement at the liability order stage of enforcement of the community charge, now regretfully repeated in respect of the proposed council tax.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>There is little or no judicial input at this stage and the magistrates court is not the appropriate forum. Those coming before the court expect some judicial process and consideration of their ability to pay. The only function we have is to see that the correct procedure has been followed by the local authority—an administrative rather than judicial function.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We would certainly accept that there is a judicial role, quite properly the function of our court, in respect of appeals from an appropriate body, and in respect of the later enforcement stage.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We have put forward our views to Ministers on many occasions and our concerns that the procedure brings the magistracy into disrepute. We have urged that we not be involved at the liability order stage of enforcement of the proposed Council Tax.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We would be most grateful for your support in substituting some other forum to administer what is in efffect a vetting process at the liability order stage in Schedule 4 of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
The Magistrates Association does not want its members to be involved at this early stage, but the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation suggests that they should be. The Minister seems to be nodding. I surmise that he thinks that magistrates should not be involved at that early stage. But who will be involved at that stage, and accept that role?<br><br>
No hon. Member—certainly no Opposition Member —would want to bring magistrates into disrepute, as, with the police, they have an important job tackling crime. However, the Government have brought them into disrepute over the poll tax, because ability to pay is not properly taken into account. Indeed, I went before the magistrates because I was deeply concerned about the number of my constituents who were too poor to pay the bills that the Government imposed upon them. I told the magistrates that they should use means tests—or rather, ability-to-pay tests: the Opposition hate means tests—and set aside the order if people could not pay. Many of the people who went to court were eligible for rebates—yet they were served with a summons for an amount before rebate. They did not know that they could claim rebate. The magistrates should have taken that into account.<br><br>
This problem brought the magistrates into disrepute, and we do not want the same to happen under the council tax. The courts were—and still are—absolutely jammed. Ministers are quick to blame local authorities for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
non-collection, as they did my local authority in Waltham Forest, even though it had asked for more court time to be spent on those cases. I believe that court time should be spent tackling rising crime. When the Police catch criminals I want them to go to court. The courts' time should not be spent messing around with poll or council tax cases.<br><br>
Courts have been jammed with cases that they do not want. That has brought magistrates into some disrepute because they cannot do their job properly, as Mrs. Joyce Rose pointed out. We do not want the same problems to occur with appeals. Appeals on valuations might be added to old poll tax cases. That would be an administrative nonsense. Instead of the process being simple, the appeals would go either to a tribunal or to the magistrates court. I hope that the Government will respond to my comments.<br><br>
In an intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside, I said that not only valuations but other matters might be the subject of appeal. I mentioned entitlement to discount. There may be appeals about whether a property should be included in or omitted from the valuation list. There may be appeals about liability for council tax, or about the imposition of a penalty for failing to supply information. We have just debated a clause and associated schedule that will allow a £50 fine for failing to provide information, followed by another £200 fine if necessary. People may want to appeal against that, or the council might want to take someone to court to unish him for providing fraudulent information.<br><br>
Because the system is so complicated, with so many invisible people, those penalised may not know whether information is inaccurate, and might appeal. Then there is the issue of completion notices by the authority. Which appeals take priority? If valuation appeals are likely to take a long time, perhaps they should be put on the back burner while the information appeals are dealt with. I hope that the courts do not have to deal with that, or Mrs. Rose will be writing to us again, but in a much longer letter.<br><br>
1.30 am<br><br>
Who should have the right of appeal has also been discussed with the DOE and the local authority associations. Appeal rights on valuation matters are normally available to residents but I note that anyone with a superior interest—normally the owner of the property, but perhaps including the billing authority—could also appeal, It is strange that a person's right to appeal can be overridden by someone who allegedly has a superior interest. That rings all sorts of alarm bells. What will happen to the first appeal? Will it be put in line, or be dealt with at the same time?<br><br>
I am worried that the billing authority may have the opportunity to appeal. That reminds me of the immigration appeal process, in which I am involved with several constituents. An immigrant who appeals against a Home Office decision—made by an adjudicator or a tribunal—has to go through a difficult process. Until recently, if he won the appeal that was it, but that process was changed so that the Home Office could then appeal to have the ruling reversed. I objected to that change in the immigration procedures as being against natural justice.<br><br>
It seems that the same will apply here; a billing authority may make its case for a valuation and an appeal may be argued out in the court or tribunal. An individual who has gone to the difficulty and expense of appealing may win; it is not right that the billing authority should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0278">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
then be able to submit another appeal. As with immigration, subsequent appeals may go to the High Court, which will bump up the costs enormously. Will the Minister comment on that natural justice point?<br><br>
If there is to be a process under which the billing authority or the valuation officer can appeal, too, if he loses his case, will that appeal go to the High Court? Will the Minister say whether the Government propose to set up an interim, less-expensive panel—yet another appeal tier? That will again cause problems because such a process will be expensive for the public purse. I should be interested to know the Government's position on that.<br><br>
I have many other issues to raise. I do not know whether I should do so—perhaps I shall because they are important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend will choose to continue his speech for two or three more minutes. We then want to hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, especially after hearing the comments about Wigan and the Sheffield Eagles. I should like to hear the prediction of my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) for the result of the match between Wigan Athletics and Leyton Orient next Saturday. It is important that Leyton Orient wins, so that it stays in the promotion race. However, such a prediction would create a diversion in our proceedings. The only way in which I can stay in order, Mr. Leadbitter, is to say that, if my hon. Friend forecasts a win for Wigan, being a Leyton Orient man, I shall submit an appeal.<br><br>
I wonder whether a time limit will be set. In case members of the Committee misunderstand me, there will be no time limit on my speech! Has the Minister an idea about setting a time limit in which valuation appeals can be heard? Some organisations are recommending that one should be set.<br><br>
Anxiety has been expressed about the reference the Minister made to setting up of locally based non-judicial panels. We deserve an explanation of what he has in mind. What authority will the panels have? Who will form the membership? It is important that the panels have the respect of the people who appear before them. Why is the judicial element being removed from such a process?<br><br>
Perhaps ex-valuation officers or ex-local government officers will be members of the panels. If so, then the fairness argument comes into play. Those who submit appeals will want to know that they will be considered fairly. A balance must be struck between expertise and being seen to be fair. If the panels are to be non-judicial, the Minister must explain why. We do not want those people who used to be called the "great and the good" to be members of the panels; some of them were not so great and not so good.<br><br>
We do not want an old Tory crony made a panel member at the recommendation of a Tory Minister, as has happened, incidentally, in the NHS trusts. That will be subject to much objection from local level. Whenever Conservative party cronies are made part of important appeal procedures, they seem to be paid an enormous amount out of public funds for turning up for a couple of hours a week. The clerk of the court does all the work, but that money is paid for a little sinecure. I hope that we shall not go down that road for such an important appeals process.<br><br>
As we are talking about appeals, we must consider
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
discount appeals. I understand that the Government propose to impose a duty on local authorities, and I should like to know whether that is true. In discussions with local authority associations, it has been suggested that the Government are considering imposing a duty on local authorities to take such steps as are necessary to ascertain discount entitlement. That would be serious. Many duties are imposed on local authorities, and principal among them is the duty to house people who are homeless. They perform that duty to the best of their ability, although that is restricted because the Government have sold off all the authorities' homes under the right-to-buy legislation and will not allow them to build new ones. Often, they have to put people into bed-and-breakfast accommodation because of Government policies, but they do their best to perform their duty. In my area, that means that people on the waiting list have no chance of being rehoused although the council is trying to meet its legal duty.<br><br>
If a legal duty is imposed on local authorities as part of the discount procedure, it will have a number of consequences. First, they must establish a register so that they can prove that they have tried to fulfil their duty. Secondly, they will have to chase people in every borough because of their duty to ensure that those who are entitled to discounts receive them. Thirdly, those who apply for discounts must be investigated thoroughly. Such a duty would cause serious problems in relation to appeals.<br><br>
The main purpose of the amendment is to require the Secretary of State to publish annually information on the number of appeals to tribunals, quangos, other bodies and even the magistrates courts. That information would include details about the proportion of appeals that are successful and the waiting time before they were heard. Those factors are important and I see no reason why the Government should not accept the amendment.<br><br>
If there are likely to be enormous delays in dealing with appeals, we should know about them. We are engaged in enacting the Bill, and we may be able to decide on other arrangements to tackle the problems.<br><br>
As well as answering all my questions, I hope that the Government will accept this reasonable amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Leadbitter, and colleagues. Unless we continue after 2 am, it would be extremely unfair to throw a series of questions at the Minister.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) will not win against Wigan Athletic on Saturday, if only because Wigan's manager wants to keep his job as the team has not won the past seven or eight matches.<br><br>
We have dealt with the principal concepts, had a run around the track and a bash at the Government. That is all part of the game, but we must try to agree on workable appeals provisions, irrespective of political differences. I know that I have said that many times, but it is not a tactic. I genuinely believe that, once all the different political views have been expressed, we must try to find workable solutions to these problems. We should ensure that constituents have the access to tribunals that they require, which enables them to raise the issues to which they wish to draw attention. Access should be provided as professionally and quickly as possible so that as many people as possible receive a remedy. I shall talk about workable procedures and the Government's intentions for the tribunals.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0279">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
1.45 am<br><br>
It is interesting to note—in the Minister's favour—that the tribunal system is not narrow in terms of evaluation and banding. As I understand it, there are many methods of access to tribunals. That provides an excellent opportunity for the public to ensure that their grievances are dealt with. It is extremely difficult, however, to devise legislation to ensure that the structures are capable of dealing with the multifarious types of objections upon which tribunals decide.<br><br>
It is vital at the outset for the Government to give some indication of the membership of tribunals and whether training will be provided. The members should be drawn from a range of backgrounds and should have a professional understanding of the issues. As with magistrates, there should be some form of training to ensure that tribunal decisions are of a high quality. The majority of cases will be dealt with by tribunals. They should be run in a way that prevents the need to consider case law or go to the High Court.<br><br>
There must be clear and precise public guidelines about access to the appeals procedure. Obviously, in the interests of valuation and discount officers, there should be a complaints procedure to be used before they go to tribunals. We must try to militate against the problem, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton referred, of tens of thousands of appeals clogging the system. That might be inevitable, because of system that the Government will create. We must try to ensure, however, that there is quality local access to officers so that cases can be reviewed and, perhaps, resolved without the need to go to a tribunal. Therefore, tribunals would deal only with cases that have been reviewed by valuation or discount officers.<br><br>
That would work in a similar way to the social security system in which adjudication officers review decisions in an attempt to resolve grievances locally without recourse to formal tribunals. Will the Government consider such proposals?<br><br>
If the scenario to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton referred is not to happen, there should be an appropriate cycle of appeal hearings. There should not be ad hoc appeal hearings. Some communities will be involved in several appeals, others will not. It will be necessary to look at what happens in every locality. We must ensure that in areas where many appeals are lodged there will be an appropriate cycle for tribunal hearings. By an appropriate cycle I do not mean once a quarter, half-yearly or annually; I mean regular access to ensure that tribunals deal with complaints.<br><br>
If a tribunal is not held within a certain time to deal with an appeal, will the appeal be upheld automatically, as happens in Scottish law, or will the Government allow appeals to build up? The clause should make it clear that if an appeal is not heard within an appropriate time the appeal will automatically be upheld. That would be an incentive to ensure that tribunals were held within an appropriate period.<br><br>
What priority will be given to cases? In areas where there are many appeals, it is important that guidelines be given to the public when appeals are submitted so that everyone knows which cases will be given priority. If the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
public know the likely time scale there will be less frustration and fewer attempts to undermine the tribunal's credibility. Delays in procedure or muddled thinking should not undermine that credibility.<br><br>
Many of my hon. Friends have said that an annual report should be made—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Is there a problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely trying to be helpful. If the Minister wants to throw a few hedgehogs under me, I shall throw a few porcupines under him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should hate the hon. Gentleman to think that I was being discourteous. I was simply trying to ascertain whether the hon. Gentleman intended to go so dangerously close to the witching hour that my reply would have to wait until tomorrow, because I do not wish to short-change him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would not consider short-changing me.<br><br>
I shall try to finish the points that I wish to make, but I do not think that the Minister will have time to reply tonight.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have said that the Secretary of State should produce a report showing how many cases have come before tribunals, how many have been upheld and how many rejected. Decisions of tribunals should be reported to the Secretary of State and the information used by other tribunals or by individuals who wish to be represented at tribunals. The public should have an assurance that cases involving similar principles in various districts are dealt with in the same way throughout the United Kingdom, and that those who represent people in tribunals are aware of decisions made by other tribunals.<br><br>
I understand that the procedure on appeals on points of law will be similar to that under the poll tax legislation: they will be made to the High Court and not to a county court or magistrates court. Instead of using the High Court, have the Government considered using the office of the commissioners, which deals with points of law involving industrial tribunals? Commissioners have the standing of High Court judges in determining appeals on points of law.<br><br>
Some people may prefer to take their appeal to the High Court because they are entitled to legal aid, which would not be available to them if they went to the commissioners. If appeals to the High Court build up, could some be dealt with by the commissioners, whose decisions would be binding on a point of law?<br><br>
When the Minister replies tomorrow, I hope that he will say what the Government have in mind. Have they concluded their discussions with local authority representatives? Will they publish an easily readable booklet for the public? The Government could charge local authorities for it, but a booklet should be available so that people know their rights and are aware of the procedure. The booklet should be available to CABs, because it would be helpful to all concerned.</span></p>
