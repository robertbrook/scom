</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had begun to explain some of the main points in relation to amendment No. 127. In preparing the proposals, we gave careful thought to the issue of consultation before application for an order is made; amendments Nos. 5 and 57 propose that such consultation should be the subject of statutory rules.<br><br>
There is no doubt that early consultation by prospective applicants for orders is essential. We considered making specific statutory provision for consultation, but we do not believe that that is necessary or that it represents a feasible way of achieving the objective.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
Our difficulty is defining accurately what is meant by consultation and what would fulfil an obligation to consult. Consultation should ideally be an ongoing process rather than a single act, which makes it difficult to describe in statutory terms suitably meaningful requirements.<br><br>
The new procedure will be used for a wide range of schemes, from minor modifications to a railway to new main lines, from small scale canal works to tidal barrages. It would be difficult to prescribe rules for consultation that would be sufficiently comprehensive to include all those who might want to contribute to the process and, at the same time, be flexible enough to suit all the different sorts of application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once an order was made, would the public be able to see the plans? Under the normal planning procedure, they could visit their library or the planning department. I presume that they would be able to see the plans but that if they want a copy they would have to purchase it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is right if they wanted to take a copy away. They would be able to see the plans before the public inquiry got under way. They would obviously want to consider their position carefully. Some arrangements could be made to provide copies. There may well be a charge, but that is the standard practice in other planning applications, which in some ways we are trying to mirror. Some types of order, such as those to authorise penalty fares schemes might suggest completely different consultation requirements, while some minor orders might be of no general interest.<br><br>
The more complex and numerous that we make the statutory hurdles that intending applicants have to cross, the greater is the bureaucratic burden on them to ensure that they have complied with the rules. There would also be more opportunities for procedural challenges to the validity of applications—for example, on the grounds that the version of a scheme applied for was not the same as the one on which consultation took place. Statutory provision could significantly extend the timescale for the preparation of draft orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's comments about the bureaucratic burden for the proposers of the scheme, but what about the bureaucratic burden for objectors? Let us take the example of the Ramblers Association. Under highways provisions, it is given notification of footpaths that are to be closed. In addition, it must watch private Bills. Someone has to read through every private Bill that is deposited. That is a time-consuming, although relatively easy task. Private Bills are deposited once a year and it is easy to go through them and pick out any clause that refers to a footpath. If orders are to be made on an ad hoc basis through the year—which makes sense for the promoters' proposals—how will organisations such as the Ramblers Association keep a check? The answer is for the Minister to give us a guarantee that it will be a requirement that the promoters consult such organisations about every proposal for diversion relating to a footpath. Can that be included in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First and foremost, any proposal would be advertised. I understand that that is the way in which a public footpath is closed at present, although that does not apply to the ones that we shall include in the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0708">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
But the general closure of a public footpath requires a notice to be published in the local press and the Ramblers Association is used to lodging the necessary objections.<br><br>
I think that that answers the point made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). I accept what he said about private Bills. They all come in at one time and they can easily be monitored. No other Bills can subsequently be deposited and they must be deposited in one place. We might have to consider that further.<br><br>
We have provided for statutory consultation with the local planning authority because the Department receiving the order must have a statement on the planning position. If the project is a railway or tramway, we are providing prior consultation with the railway inspectorate to check that the scheme can be built. In consulting others, we have asked for proposals for statutory consultation before the application is made.<br><br>
There are two further important checks in the new procedures that will achieve their desired purpose while avoiding the problems to which the amendments could lead. First, the application rules provide a statutory requirement for the notification of proposals at the time of application. Failure to fulfil those requirements would invalidate an application.<br><br>
The second check is the obvious delays that could result after an application has been made if an applicant has not adequately consulted with relevant bodies or, in the case of more significant proposals, with the public at large. Clearly, the greater the volume of objections to a proposal, the greater the likelihood that the Secretary of State would decide to hold a public inquiry, for which the applicant would have to pay.<br><br>
Moreover, under clause 11(4), broadly the same group of persons as those whom amendment No. 5 seeks to protect, are given the right to insist on an inquiry or hearing if they object to the proposals in an order.<br><br>
If it becomes apparent at an inquiry that the objections are of such merit and significance as to oblige an applicant to revise his proposals substantially, he would most probably have to go back to square one and re-apply, paying a second application fee.<br><br>
Those are significant incentives for an applicant to consult properly before he applies for an order. Naturally, we shall give full details in guidelines about what consultation prospective applicants should undertake. The applicants will be the losers if they fail to consult properly.<br><br>
The topics covered by amendments No. 6 and No. 7 are dealt with in the draft rules, which I have circulated to the Committee. It is very much a preliminary draft, on which we are consulting widely. Hon. Members can see that the rules are consistent with the principles behind the amendments. The application rules can adequately provide for the matters that hon. Members have raised. I do not see any advantage in adding the provisions to the Bill. I hope that Opposition Members, in particular the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn), will be reassured by what I have said and by the draft rules. The Bill provides significant protection for the interests of those who might be affected by the proposals in the order. The Government are aware of the importance of striking a proper balance, in the Bill and in the rules, between all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
interests involved—applicants and objectors alike. We take the matter seriously, so I hope that the hon. Member for Southport will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed with what the Minister said. I remind him that he said that he would reconsider the footpaths procedure. I was also disappointed that the technical advice that I was seeking from the back of the Room did not seem to be forthcoming. I shall have to speak to the Committee from memory, which is rather worrying.<br><br>
I understand that the footpath procedure that was laid down in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 amended the old procedure, under which anyone who wanted to close a footpath had to give notice in the local press and, I think, in the <i>London Gazette.</i> One local authority pointed out that it was expensive to put a notice in the <i>London Gazette</i> and asked whether there was a simpler procedure. The simpler procedure was that organisations that were interested in footpaths had to be notified. Changes must be advertised at the site—a poster must be put up at the point where the path is to be diverted—and in the local paper. Named organisations such as the Ramblers Association, the Peak and Northern Footpaths Society and horse riders groups must be notified. We want that procedure to be included in the legislation that we are discussing so that such groups do not have to trawl through the various orders that are laid down to discover whether a footpath-related matter is involved.<br><br>
There should be a requirement to notify people with an interest in footpaths. The Minister suggested a local paper. I do not know about his area, but there are some parts of the country where it is difficult to decide which paper is the local one. Many footpaths are walked on by people who live not in the locality but in surrounding areas. Publication in the local paper may be useful to some people, but it would not guarantee that the people who might be most affected saw it.<br><br>
Similarly, if a notice was put up for a month on a footpath on 3 January, after people had returned to work, it would be much less likely to be seen than if it had been put up in June. Some footpaths are little walked in winter. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter and explain the existing procedure for closure or diversion of footpaths, in case I have been mistaken. He should bring the procedure for footpaths under private Bills, or private orders as they will be in future, into line with the existing procedure under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. That would make it easier for organisations that wish to monitor or question closures, by enabling them to use one procedure rather than having to look in several different places to discover whether an important path is threatened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I almost entirely agree with some of the hon. Gentleman's points. We do not want a different system to apply to such orders. The matter is best dealt with under the rules. I want to hear what the Ramblers Association has to say about the hon. Gentleman's points. We shall consider including them in the rules. I hope that that assurance has gone a good part of the way to meeting the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's remarks, and as long as he remembers that I am from Southport, not Stockport, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0709">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate <span class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 3, line 26, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Rules under this section may make provision for the Secretary of State to determine, before the consideration of any application, that the requirements of the rules (including any special dispensation or requirement applying to the application in question by virtue of provision made under subsection (4) above) have been complied with; and where the Secretary of State has so determined it shall be conclusively presumed that the requirements imposed under the rules have been complied with.'.</p></blockquote>
I draw attention to the fact that under an earlier selection, Mr. Latham, you had added amendment No. 85 for consideration. That seems to have got lost. It is consequential and technical and I hope that it will be in order to refer to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman's provisional selection is exactly that: provisional. Clearly it has been changed, but if the hon. Member wishes to refer tangentially to another amendment later, the Chairman may be diplomatically deaf for a time. I leave it to the hon. Member's common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful. I should be interested to know what process of deselection has been applied to such an inoffensive little amendment. I think that the substance of it can be dealt with under amendment No. 58.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
As we have heard at some length, clause 6 enables the Secretary of State to lay down the preliminary procedural requirements with which applications for orders under the Bill will need to comply. Clause 23 enables someone who wishes to challenge the validity of an order to take procedures in the High Court within 42 days of the publication of notice that an order under clause 1 or 3 has been made. The right to challenge an order under clause 23 will apply whether the ground for the challenge is one of substance or merely procedural, for example, if the application for the order did not comply with the procedural requirement laid down in rules made under clause 6.<br><br>
The amendment is of a technical nature. It was brought to our attention by British Rail and I am sure that the Committee will agree that it is on the right lines. It is an attempt to reflect one of the more valuable features of the current practice of the House on private Bills. Under the Standing Orders of the House there is provision for examiners to consider whether promoters of a Bill have complied with the requirements of the Standing Orders. Third parties are entitled to appear before the examiners to complain of any non-compliance with Standing Orders. However, a Committee on a private Bill thereafter may not inquire into compliance with Standing Orders that lay down the initial procedural steps relating to the Bill. Once the Bill has been enacted, the validity of the Act cannot be called into question.<br><br>
The Bill would allow subsequent challenges to be made on whether the original rules had been complied with. The amendment is designed to ensure that, once an order has been made and an application has been considered, that technical question cannot be reopened. That is in the interests of those making the orders and everybody else concerned. It will remove an element of obscure judicial uncertainty during that process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the amendment, how will people have the opportunity to object? At present, they can go to the Court of Referees to object. If there is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
a scheme of national significance, it should be possible for the House to object to the proposals. The Minister would make the order and it would then come to the House for approval. In that debate it should be possible for hon. Members to argue that the proper consultations and environmental assessments were not made and that the other requirements were not met in that particular case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will find, although I shall have to seek advice on the point, that we are not talking about schemes of national significance. If we were, the matters would be examined by the House long before the order was made. That would happen under the proposal. The House would consider the general proposition and the order would be made only after a long process. The amendment is about matters of a technical nature. We are trying to avoid a long drawn-out period of doubt on technical or minor matters during which objectors might find all sorts of reasons for challenging orders.<br><br>
The amendment will ensure that the Secretary of State will not consider an application until he has determined that the application has been properly made in compliance with the rules. The Secretary of State will be precluded from making an order unless the application for it has been made in compliance with the rules. The amendment envisages that provision will be made in the rules that, before the Secretary of State decides whether an application is properly made, an opportunity will be given for people to make representations to him if they wish to complain of non-compliance with the rules. Objectors could object at that stage. Once the application has been made and the Secretary of State has so determined, it will be conclusive. It will not be possible for the matter to be reopened under clause 23. That opportunity still exists in relation to other matters of substance, but under the present rules of the private Bill procedure, once the initial procedures have taken place, the matter will be closed and thereafter can be challenged only on grounds of substance. That is a reasonable proposition on the same lines as the present, eminently sensible private Bill procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On this fine, but important, point, the current procedures relating to examiners are wholly and obviously objective. The examiners are officials of the House; the Court of Referees consists of hon. Members, sitting in a judicial capacity. If this was transferred as the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) suggests, it would leave matters in the hands of the Executive, which is not necessarily as objective as the other bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rules form part of a statutory instrument—they are part of the law of the land and the Secretary of State is bound to comply with those rules. He must judge whether the application conforms with them. At every stage, someone must make a judgment; if a judgment is blatantly wrong, it can be challenged. Nothing that we put into statute can prevent that. The proposal lays a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that the rules are complied with and thereafter the matter shall be deemed to be conclusively resolved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was wrong earlier to highlight the problems of schemes that the Secretary of State finds to be of national significance. The problem is not those schemes but others that people think should be considered to be of national significance. The Secretary of State will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
be acting as judge and jury on whether a scheme is of national significance. As I understand the proposal, no one would be entitled to challenge that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a separate issue. Broadly speaking, we are dealing with schemes that are not of national significance. The Minister will tell us later how many schemes are likely to be so designated. I suspect that there will be very few: we are talking about proposals familiar to the private Bill procedure—railway Bills and the like. It is sensible not to be able to reopen the matter of whether the original application was properly dealt with. That is the present position under the private Bill procedure. It is logical to incorporate that in the Bill. The Minister, who has the benefit of excellent advice, will no doubt confirm that this is a sensible, well-drafted and acceptable proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) wants to bring the Bill more into line with the present procedure. However, the change of category between the examiners or referees and the Secretary of State would make long-stop measures even more necessary. As the hon. Gentleman said, his proposals would stop long-stop measures. It is likely that in the event of an unforeseen administrative failure in notices, the courts would be prevented from awarding a judicial review because of the terms of the amendment. Under the private Bill procedure, there could be an adjustment if there were a manifest error in administration; under the hon. Gentleman's amendment, that might not be done even on judicial review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a limit on the number of long-stops. If there is provision for the Secretary of State to receive representations on the specific point of whether the rules have been complied with, it is perfectly reasonable to say that the case should not be re-opened subsequently. Objectors have a right to scrutinise and make representations before the Secretary of State decides whether the application is proper. When that has been resolved, the usual processes are observed and challenge can be made only on the grounds of substance. That is sensible and we should not have to return time and again to relatively narrow points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham is trying to put the applicant in the same position as the promoter of a private Bill, but I fear that in practice the amendment is unlikely to achieve that objective. Leaving aside whether the Secretary of State would be prepared to give a determination which was judicially reviewable, the courts would probably look unkindly on an attempt to use legislation to protect a developer from his own failure to comply with statutory rules or regulations. He cannot hide behind the law.<br><br>
In practice, I do not think that promoters have much to fear from such judicial challenges providing that they have genuinely sought to comply with the law. For example if, as a result of a clerical oversight, a statutory objector failed to receive notice of an application for an order and the objector did not realise until after the Secretary of State had made the order that his property was affected, the courts would have to decide whether the outcome would have been different if the promoter had notified the objector. Unless the promoter was incompetent, such an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
error would be likely to occur only on the very largest schemes involving perhaps hundreds of statutory objectors. It is unlikely that in those cases a single objection would have affected the decision. Of course, the objector might rightly feel aggrieved, but in deciding the case the courts would bear in mind that he would be entitled to compensation in the same way as the other statutory objectors. The prospects of the courts quashing the order would be very small. However, if the Act sought to protect promoters in the way proposed in the amendment, they might be lulled into thinking that they could get away with non-compliance with the rules. That would be sending the wrong message to promoters and to the courts.<br><br>
It is one of those rare occasions on which I think that I have the agreement, or the semi-agreement—I do not want to be too provocative—of the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). I do not suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham wanted to give promoters total protection against the courts, but that would be the result of his amendment. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not one of those people who are reassured by cross-party agreement; it arouses my suspicion. I had hoped that my amendment was technical and non-controversial, but the Committee is full of surprises, as we have all come to realise. I suspect that there is still some scope for improvement. We do not want uncertainty to prevail during the process. My hon. Friend the Minister may be right and that there may be little prospect of a promoter having a judgment made against him, but given the nature of objections to schemes the objectors' expectations may be raised and they may try to find any opportunity in the courts to challenge the scheme. Therefore, it is often the possibility of challenge that delays development. We should try to eliminate such doubts, particularly as that doubt does not exist under the present proposals.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
We do not want to protect developers who do not comply with the rules. We are placing a greater obligation on the Secretary of State to ensure that the rules are complied with and that representations can be received at an earlier stage. Once that process has been dealt with properly, thereafter that matter will be deemed to have been dealt with.<br><br>
I am no lawyer. My hon. Friend the Minister may be right that the courts could frown on attempts to limit their scope by legislation, but I am surprised by that proposition. I hope that my hon. Friend will make sure that, legally, he is correct. However, the amendment is technical rather than controversial and I do not wish to press it.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for considering the matter. If my argument is valid I hope that he will consider it at a later stage in the Bill.<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee have been fortunate this afternoon. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments finished promptly, having considered carefully all the statutory instruments before it, which enabled me to move this amendment.<br><br>
The Minister has already told me that he will accept amendment No. 25. It simply ensures that the considerable powers in clause 6 are subject to further parliamentary procedure. If any hon. Member wishes to table a prayer to gain time, it can be debated.<br><br>
That is admirable and should happen more often. Few prayers are tabled because most statutory instruments are passed without controversy or questioning, but the exceptions are important. The reserve power that ensures that the instrument comes before Parliament for 40 days, during which time a prayer is tabled, is important. It is part of our democratic process, which we should nurture and retain. I am pleased that the Minister accepts that view. I am delighted that I have improved the Bill. That does not happen often, and I take modest pleasure in achieving it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) did not realise that we were spinning out earlier debates so that he would be present for his moment of glory. I was becoming worried about what would happen to the amendment if the hon. Gentleman were not present. I thought that it might fall and that we should have to resort to a Government amendment, so depriving him of the credit for it.<br><br>
I have already told the hon. Gentleman that I am prepared to accept amendment No. 25, although there is a risk that, in applying the annulment procedure to all rules made under clause 6, they could have a knock-on effect on the implementation of the timetable. If hon. Members accept that that is a reasonable price to pay to enable Parliament to have some control over the Executive, I shall not object to the amendment.<br><br>
I shall vote for amendment 25. Consequently, amendment No. 59 will fall.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. How do the provisions of clause 7 apply to connections in and out of military depots?<br><br>
Despite the Government's much-vaunted policy of relying more on the railways, many military depots have had their rail facilities withdrawn in the past year. Presumably in future, in the unlikely event of the Government remaining in power, such withdrawal proceedings will come under this schedule. I should be grateful if the Minister will tell me whether my supposition is correct and, even more important, whether material such as ammunition will be moved by road or rail in future? Bearing in mind the Government's track record in the past two or three years, I could probably answer that myself.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
I have listened to the Minister's colleagues saying how enthusiastic the Government are about transporting such materials by rail, and have compared their opinions with the reality. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government intend to use this schedule to withdraw even more of these facilities, which are much needed by military depots?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) had not walked back into the Committee Room. However, I have been passed a very helpful note from those who help me survive on these occasions. It says that this is about freight policy and suggests that I write to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will not be too put out if I say that some of his interpretations of the facts are not correct. The clause deals with orders which may sometimes affect military grounds. However, some of the hon. Gentleman's points fall a bit wide of the provisions under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that they do. Awkward questions to Ministers always fall outside the ambit of the amendment or clause being discussed. However, bearing in mind the provisions of the schedule, I do not think it unreasonable to ask the Minister whether he intends to use it to withdraw rail facilities, which have been consistently withdrawn over the past three years. We do not need a long and detailed reply—yes or no will be sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman by giving him what he asked for: the answer is no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is most unfair when Ministers reply in such a direct fashion.</span></p>

MODEL CLAUSES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 4, line 30, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>'which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment which would require the negative procedure for orders that are made instead of making them exercisable by statutory instrument, as provided in clause 8(4), without any further parliamentary provision.<br><br>
The matter appears slightly complicated because the clause allows the Secretary of State to make model provisions for subsequent incorporation in rules made under clause 6, which will now be made under the negative procedure. It looks as though the amendment is putting this clause all square with clause 6, or—and I am not sure about this—the model provisions in a draft order are for consultation. Would the amendment, if accepted—as it was, happily, in clause 6—mean that clause 8(4) was, to use a Church of England word, otiose, and had fallen into desuetude. I look forward to the Minister telling me whether that is so, because desuetude is not good for anyone or anything to fall into.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, South says that he is not sure what his amendment does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subject to the amendment being accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subject to the amendment being accepted. Its acceptance might have consequences which

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
the hon. Gentleman is not sure about. That makes me even more concerned to ensure that I give the hon. Gentleman the correct information.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, we have conceded the use of the annulment procedure on orders made for applications under clause 6. However, I do not think that a similar concession is justified on clause 8. I hope that my explanation will reassure the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The purpose of model clauses is to encourage consistency in the drafting of orders by promoters and to simplify that task by enabling orders to refer to standard provisions. However, it will not be mandatory for all model clauses to be applied in all orders. Some will be inappropriate in specific cases and promoters will be able to disapply clauses with the Secretary of State's agreement. Unlike the rules to be made under clause 6, the incorporation of model clauses is, therefore, permissive.<br><br>
It would be extremely difficult to make much sense of the statutory instruments which will create the model clauses. Read in isolation and out of context, I doubt whether any of us would be able to comment helpfully on them. However, I think that all draft orders made under clause 8 should be shown to the Clerk of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments before they are made. That would be helpful to that Committee when it scrutinised orders made under clauses 1 and 3, which contain model clauses.<br><br>
I hope that my explanation will reassure hon. Gentleman. If it does not, I am sure that he will return to the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not an unreasonable explanation. The previous amendment, which was accepted, makes matters on clause 8 more complicated, which is why I raised the question. As they are models for selection and are not statutorily binding, this is a rare example where powers can be used by statutory instrument. It is rather strange, because, in effect, it provides a statutory position which is not binding. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I express my thanks to you, Mr. Latham, for selecting the amendment because it suggests a fairly odd procedure. I should not have been surprised had you thought that it was not suitable for debate.<br><br>
I tabled the amendment to highlight one of the major problems of the Bill. I do not want the Minister to tell me why the amendment is not suitable; I want him to tell me that he or his advisers have thought up a much better amendment to deal with the problem in clause 9.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
At the moment, when private Bills go through the House, any Member of Parliament can decide that an issue is worthy of debate and simply by objecting when the Bill is called for Second Reading and tabling a silly motion about it being deferred for six months, can guarantee that a debate takes place. When private Bills are running smoothly, the vast majority of Bills go through without any hon. Member objecting and causing a debate to take place. The power to pick out controversial Bills lies with any Member of Parliament. As I understand this Bill, it proposes that instead of an individual hon. Member having the right to pick out an important issue, the Secretary of State will have that right. There appears to be no mechanism in the Bill by which a Member of Parliament can challenge the Secretary of State's decision and say that a Bill has national significance, and should be subject to parliamentary procedure or that a Bill has no national significance and should go through as a local order. The Government should consider including a mechanism by which Members of Parliament have a right to challenge the Secretary of State's decision.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
Relatively few orders will have national significance. However, it will be very difficult to determine which are of local and which of national importance. That will be a matter of political judgment. No factual measure will be available to make the distinction, so the House should have the right to challenge the Secretary of State. That means that there should be a procedure that allows a debate if a large number of Members of Parliament believe that the Secretary of State has got it wrong.<br><br>
Very often, the question whether a decision is of national or local significance will be decided along party political lines. We spent much time on what is now the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Act 1988: does the Secretary of State consider that that was of local or of national significance? If one considered that it was merely to do with the expansion of a port, a respectable argument could be mounted that its significance was purely local. However, an environmental objection based on the loss of feeding grounds for birds would suggest that it was of international, rather than merely national, significance.<br><br>
That is a political judgment. The Secretary of State cannot produce a set of rules to decide what is of local and what is of national significance. Therefore, the Bill must contain a means by which a political decision by the Secretary of State can be challenged. That would not happen very often, which is why the amendment contains the requirement that "100 Members" must be convinced that there is a case to answer. I am aware of the difficulties. Arm-twisting over early-day motions can readily produce 100 signatories, so there is nothing magic about the number. However, the Bill removes the right of any Member of Parliament to seek a debate on an issue and transfers all responsibility to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
That is a considerable loss of parliamentary power for hon. Members. The Minister ought to produce a mechanism that would permit a challenge to his Department as to whether a scheme was of national or local significance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle described by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is important and has implications across the party political spectrum. For example, there was much concern about the success or otherwise of a recent Bill for the construction of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 189</span>
deep-water wharf on the Humber estuary, as it had profound implications for energy policy and employment. That is an example of a matter involving private legislation whose ramifications spread across the political spectrum.<br><br>
However, my main worry is that the Secretary of State for Transport alone—although, of course, he will have to take account of the attitude of the rest of the Government—will make the judgment. Even if it goes through on the nod, that judgment will be of national significance because its transference to the Secretary of State will have been enshrined in an Act of Parliament.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish has made an important procedural point and has been ingenious enough to include in the amendment the requirement for 100 signatures. That is very fair. If 100 hon. Members believe a matter to be of national significance, its significance is that great almost by definition. That may be a subjective statement, but the collection of 100 hon. Members' signatures would trigger a debate automatically under the procedures that follow. That would be particularly significant as a constitutional device.<br><br>
I fancy from the Minister's reaction that he finds that a bit too easy. Amendment No. 61, which I tabled and which is being taken with this group is a safety measure that would provide for the decision to be made by the Secretary of State or by "Resolution of either House". That would mean that it would not be entirely a party matter and the House could pass a resolution that the proposals were of national significance. Whichever mechanism is chosen—I prefer that of my hon. Friend to my own—there should be one. Otherwise, too much power is given to too few people, or to one person in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am minded from what the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) said that he did not necessarily want me to address my remarks to his amendment, because he recognises that his scheme has some fundamental flaws. He wanted me to address the wider issue.<br><br>
I understand the desire of hon. Members to have some control over the decision whether a scheme is treated as one of national significance, but the difficulty is whether the procedure would work. It must be right that a decision about that should be made as soon as possible after the order comes in. An earlier decision would be premature, but a late decision would be ineffective. The whole point is that Parliament's view should be known before the public inquiry. We shall come to that point on later amendments.<br><br>
We are limiting the decision to 56 days after the application for an order is lodged. In that time the Secretary of State for the Environment will be making up his mind, taking into account the importance of the scheme—we come to criteria on later amendments.<br><br>
I do not think that there will be a real difficulty in practice in coming to an agreement about which schemes are of national significance, nor do I think that such schemes will creep up on us. In an earlier debate, the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) referred to a concrete beam that would shoot us up to Edinburgh. Although in future years that may be practicable, it would be a scheme with wide national consequences and would fall into the category of a scheme of national significance. If the channel tunnel link and the resulting rail line had been introduced under the scheme, I am sure that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
Secretary of State would have regarded it as a scheme of national importance. The Secretary of State of the day will take the same considerations into account.<br><br>
I would draw a parallel between the scheme and the call-in procedure that the Secretary of State for the Environment has in planning cases. The Secretary of State has always had that discretion, which he exercises subject to the courts. Hon. Members often put pressure on him to call in schemes, but he mostly does not. I can sympathise with the hon. Member for Newham, South on amendment No. 64 because he is right to say that the use of clause 7, which deals with defence schemes and the safety of abandoned works, is unlikely to generate schemes of national significance.<br><br>
At the moment, I am not persuaded how best to meet the genuine anxieties of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. There is discretion in the planning law and the Secretary of State for the Environment can call in an application. Schemes of national significance will usually be of such great magnitude that they will be called in or designated as such and follow the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister think that the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill was of local or of national significance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to comment on that or say what might have happened. It serves no purpose for Ministers to judge past events and claim, "I should have done that if I were the Minister." That is unhelpful. Let me be honest: I am deliberately trying to sidestep the question. It is not practical for me to make a decision about something that Parliament has already decided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to agree that we are considering a substantial point. I welcome that. Does he agree that there is the difficulty of precedents being created? It is conceivable that a project of mainly local significance could be approved and passed, and that the precedent created by that scheme could be prayed in aid of others. Precedents are followed in law. Accepting one project could create a precedent for others, which could have national significance. The Bill should include a mechanism to cover that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If anyone made a proposal that met the criteria, I would accept it. However, it is difficult to meet all the criteria. Early-day motions are not a satisfactory method of proceeding. I am sure that we could find most peculiar early-day motions that had attracted more than 100 signatures. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish admitted that he had tabled a probing amendment rather than a serious proposition so that the subject could be debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because it is difficult to determine which of the items should be tackled by the Secretary of State, a simple procedure, such as 100 Members signing a motion, should be adopted. A hundred Members would not sign a motion that would affect the time of the House so glibly as some of them sign early-day motions. Unless they believed in the motion, they would not sign it if they were expected to be present during the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not allowed to freewheel on such matters, but if we stated that the debates would take place on a Friday morning and that all those who signed the early-day motion had to be present, the hypothesis of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0714">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) might be correct. It might be difficult to obtain 100 signatures. However, that does not mean that such a procedure is right. The Secretary of State might believe that a scheme had national significance but could not obtain 100 signatures because Members of Parliament did not wish to discuss that matter. Therefore, a procedure should exist for the Secretary of State to decide the matter in its best interests while taking account of all the circumstances.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, South said that precedents might be established. That is an important point. Schemes of national significance will be few and far between. However, they will be vital. Sometimes important schemes for roads are proposed. There are ways of ensuring that debates take place in the House when feelings are especially strong.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will withdraw amendment No. 30. The Government have considered the matter carefully and tried to make a definition. I am open to further representations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister has agreed to examine various criteria. It is peculiar that the Minister claims that we cannot accept the actions of 100 hon. Members as a criterion. We use the numbering of Members of Parliament every day. We use the criterion of numbers in Committee for voting. The place runs on numbers.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Whenever I table early-day motions, I have the greatest difficulty getting Members to sign them. By and large, with some exceptions, they do not flock to support them. I have some persuading to do.<br><br>
A simple method of counting votes is used to ensure that instruments are not debated upstairs in Committee but are debated on the Floor of the House. Hon. Members stand up and are counted. If 20 stand up, the debate takes place in the Chamber. That procedure is seldom used but when it is, it is common and familiar to us all. Those who want it to happen rush round urging 20 people to be there when the proposal is made to push the instrument upstairs. Even a small number like that is not always easy to achieve. The figure of 100 is not an inconsiderable goal. If the Minister thinks that it should be 150, we are obviously willing to discuss it.<br><br>
Hitherto there has been the opportunity for maximum potential input by hon. Members through the private Bill procedure. A motion can be tabled to prevent a private Member's Bill from going through on the nod. When it is debated it is difficult to get it through if it is felt to be controversial. Hon. Members can talk for three hours. A closure of 100 has to be obtained to get the Bill through. There was maximum potential participation. Controversial private Member's Bills such as the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill, which involved a straightforward political conflict, were still passed although its procedures were lengthy because Opposition Members wished to oppose the Bill.<br><br>
The Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure has suggested a number of procedures that at present are wholly the responsibility of the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) mentioned the potential for controversy after the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
definition of a project and the back-stop whereby hon. Members could get together and table a motion to ensure that it became a project of national significance. It qualifies the Secretary of State's position and Ministers do not generally like qualifying his position because it is easier if he is able to propose an order, make a decision and there are no complications about having to deal with too many hon. Members.<br><br>
In the transitional period, we should look at the link between the real power that hon. Members had to delay private Bills and the criteria for giving the Secretary of State the absolute power of decision. It is an absolute power. He will consult and sound out opinions but it is ultimately his decision because that is what the Bill says. The amendment would modify that slightly. If the Minister is not satisfied by the criteria, I am heartened by his comment that he is willing to look at other criteria. I hope that we can discuss this on Report. We shall be limited in time but we can ensure that the procedure is not entirely lost sight of in Parliament. People who believe that a project of national significance should be so defined will have the task of mounting the hurdle of that criteria. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. I am sure that he will heed the Minister's words and withdraw the amendment so that it can be tabled in a different form on Report, when I hope that it will have the support of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seemed to be playing the position of the Secretary of State against that of 100 Members, suggesting that the Secretary of State was the most appropriate person to act upon a set of criteria. The amendent includes the word "or". The Secretary of State would still have authority to say that a matter was of national significance. It would be easy, even if that provision did not exist, for a Secretary of State to mobilise signatories 100 to a motion from the Government Benches.<br><br>
The amendment, or something like it, is needed because the problem is more likely to be faced by Opposition Members who discover planning errors, than by Conservative Members who will have ready-made avenues to the Secretary of State if they want to try to influence a decision. That is the reality of politics in this place. A motion is often signed by members of one political party only in an attempt to force an issue forward. The rights of constituents represented by Opposition Members should be taken into account.<br><br>
I cite the example of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Bill, with which I was involved. That private Bill was finally defeated in another place, helped by a piece of general legislation, now the Ports Act 1991. The planning equivalent of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Bill would find it difficult to emerge if the Secretary of State was expected merely to act when there was a strong feeling that planning agreements were being made in bits and pieces and building up into a matter of national significance that hon. Members recognised and wanted to raise. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider implementing the principles if not the technique and tactics of the amendment on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being out of the Room when the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) moved the amendment. Perhaps if I had heard his speech
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0715">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
I would have found his arguments so persuasive that I should have been convinced of the need for the amendment. I am not so convinced, however.<br><br>
There is an attraction in having a neat criteria that tells us when a scheme is of national significance. However it is difficult to come up with something that would work. We should remind ourselves that we are discussing railway lines, ports and waterways. There will be few such schemes which could, in common sense terms, be seen to be of national significance, especially in relation to railways. For example, the high-speed channel tunnel link self-evidently would fall into that category. Public and parliamentary pressure would leave no doubt about its national significance.<br><br>
However, we must consider the possibility—I should go further and say probability—of there being a hybrid Bill. We have not touched the hybrid Bill procedure. Matters of such size and complexity will come automatically to Parliament anyway because of their national significance, or they will be dealt with by Parliament anyway because of the other procedures that might apply.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) mentioned ports and the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Bill. I find it hard to think of any measure that is equal in planning terms to such a Bill. Privatisation Bills would not be dealt with under that procedure. It becomes harder and harder to think of major schemes that would be automatically of national significance. That is not to suggest that there will be none, but I believe that there will be few.<br><br>
The proposal of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, whereby 100 Members could demand that the matter be dealt with first by Parliament, would be debased quickly. The 100 signatures would appear not because the matter is of national significance, but because it is controversial. It could be a local planning issue. An hon. Member could rally his colleagues and, especially if they were in Opposition, try to embarrass the Government. The judgment would then be made not on grounds of national significance, but on the controversy. There is room for argument about that, but that is not what the Bill is supposed to be dealing with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has partly revealed our difficulty by talking about the Government, who would act only as a statutory parliamentary agent. The Government may be neutral. It is possible—I do not know whether the Joint Committee considered this—that the Government may not be too well disposed towards a particular application. Are not we in danger of suppressing promoters who might otherwise be successful in promoting a private Bill? If hon. Members get off their chests in one debate what is necessary regarding a local matter, which the hon. Member for Faversham says could be promoted as a national issue, is not that a great economy on the time that we can sometimes spend at present?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all parliamentarians and we can all envisage times when we should campaign avidly to have a matter considered by the House. I suspect that Conservative Members will not experience being in Opposition for many years, but if we could imagine that unlikely scenario, we might deploy the argument about how such a move would save time. However, under the rules the matter must be of national significance. How many nationally significant schemes in planning terms will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
occur in relation to ports, waterways or rail development? Logically, almost every scheme of national significance will speak for itself and there will be an outcry if Parliament does not take it up. Therefore, there is no need to lay down criteria. Even if one wanted to specify the criteria, such a mathematical formula would not provide the right answer.<br><br>
We should resist the temptation of neatness and clarity and accept the logic. The force mejeure or political will of a country will express itself in such a way that any scheme of national significance will be brought to the House. It will be in the interests of the Government of the day to ensure that that happens, otherwise major power station or road schemes would be so contentious that they would be bogged down in political controversy. Heaven help the promoter of a scheme of national significance that the Government of the day do not like. I suspect that it would not get much financial backing. It is in the Government's interest to have a quick parliamentary decision on major schemes and then to get on with the planning procedures. The Government should not be hostile to such propositions.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
It would be interesting to know whether clearer criteria can be set out. People would like to know what those criteria are, but the amendment is not on the right way to achieve that. It is an important matter, and the more we talk about it the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's remarks did not follow on from my comments. I did not suggest that the amendment would provide the perfect mechanism. I even expressed gratitude to the Chair for selecting it because I realised that it was a slightly difficult matter. Nevertheless, the issue is important.<br><br>
The Minister demonstrated the problem when he said that there would be few schemes of national significance. That might worry one or two people. It prompted me to ask whether the Felixstowe dock and harbour scheme was of local or national significance. The Minister told us bluntly that he was waffling to get round the question. That shows that it is not that easy to determine what is local and what is national. Furthermore, it shows that the problem is political. If a Government are committed to market forces and free enterprise, what happens in Felixstowe may not matter to the rest of the country, it is merely a matter of local enterprise. The alternative view is that environmental issues, especially those involving feeding grounds for birds, are of international significance. That is important and should be considered on a national basis.<br><br>
On the whole, I believe that on some occasions the Secretary of State will make a political judgment on whether a scheme is of local or national significance. It is that political judgment that should be challenged. The Minister said that it was always possible for hon. Members to find a way of bringing an issue to the Floor of the House. I agree. Any hon. Member can pick up the Mace and get several colleagues to stand in Black Rod's way. However, that is not a helpful way of going about it. It is better to devise, either through the Standing Orders of the House or in legislation, a legitimate way to achieve the same end.<br><br>
I realise that there is a problem and that difficulties will arise about the Secretary of State making a decision. If the Minister says that every time several people lobby the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0716">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
Secretary of State saying that a certain scheme should be regarded as one of national significance, the Secretary of State will give way, that may be one solution. However if, on some occasions, he wants to protect parliamentary time and other procedures, there should be a way to measure how many people feel that a scheme is of national rather than local significance.<br><br>
That could be done in several ways. For example, we could have a procedure rather like that under Standing Order No. 20, under which hon. Members are entitled to have two or three minutes during which they can put to the House their reasons for maintaining that a matter is of national significance. If 20 or 40 hon. Members were to stand in their place, there should be a debate. That almost devises a Standing Order of the House, but we are not empowered to do that. That is where the difficulty arises. We cannot marry Standing Orders of the House, which ensure a proper debate, with a piece of legislation.<br><br>
I accept that the matter is difficult, but it is not good enough for the Minister to agree that a problem exists and then say that because my amendment does not provide a satisfactory solution, it is up to us to find an alternative. It is for the Government—who are removing the power of individual Back Benchers to object to any private Bill, however trivial, and handing it over to the Secretary of State—to say that there should be some sort of half-way house. If there is anxiety among a substantial number of hon. Members, they should have the right to provoke a debate.<br><br>
The amendment uses the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"expressed in Resolution of either House"</p></blockquote>
That may be the alternative that we should put into the Bill. We would then have to campaign to change Standing Orders so that there would be a mechanism to ensure that such a resolution was debated. Will the Minister give the matter further thought? He said that he was considering it, but could not see a way forward.<br><br>
When we reach Report, there should be a legitimate mechanism in the Bill to deal with the problem so that we do not have to rely on breaking Standing Orders to obtain such a debate. We would not then, if Mr. Speaker were unhappy, have to say that we were only following the course advocated by the Minister for Shipping. It is not good procedure for the Minister to advocate breaking the existing rules to force a Minister to come to the House. We should not have to manipulate or break Standing Orders. A legitimate procedure should be introduced in the Bill or by amendment to Standing Orders. On the basis that we may return to the matter on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 62 follows on from amendment No. 30 and most of the points have already been debated. The Minister dealt with one or two points. He said that he would look up the criteria later. I do not know what that means. Perhaps the Minister knows more than I do and will say what it means.<br><br>
The meaning of the word "national" in the context of the clause has not been explained. We have talked about national significance, but does "national" refer to the people of England or Wales or both? Is Scotland included?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has pressed me to publish the criteria by which the Secretary of State would judge whether a scheme was of national significance or not, or to write the criteria into the Bill. Statutory or even non-statutory published guidelines would need to be tightly drawn to be worthwhile and would subject future Secretaries of State to the accusation in the courts that they have limited their discretion. Even if there were guidance notes, the Secretary of State would have to consider every case on its merits.<br><br>
In my view, for a scheme to count it would be expected to affect a significant part of the country rather than a small part of it. It would therefore have to affect physically a substantial area either directly or because of a product, such as a major tidal energy barrage. It would probably be costly for a project of its type and would have major land use and environmental effects. Such a scheme would qualify, but other more local projects might also be referred to Parliament if, for example, the local environment impact raised issues of national importance. In some respects, the criteria would be the same as those used in asking the Secretary of State for Environment to call in a planning application. It is possible to obtain a rough guide as to what the criteria are before a scheme is called in.<br><br>
There is nothing wrong with amendment No. 62 as a statement of intent, although it should refer also to Scotland, As hon. Members will have gathered from my previous remarks, I broadly agree with the hon. Member for Southport. I do not favour the amendment because it does not add much. It does not restrict the decision in any way. We shall probably publish a guidance note, if that would help, but the decisions themselves will have to be taken on the merits of each case. With those assurances, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister said. It is difficult to fix the criteria, but if guidance notes could be issued they would be welcome.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned local examples. For instance, a local beauty spot with national significance would come within the criteria that he mentioned. A local railway line could have a significant bearing on a national line. Would that come within the criteria?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be getting onto dangerous ground in saying whether particular examples would count. I have tried not to be too specific because of the dangers that that involves. I am reluctant to give answers to those examples. The hon. Member for Southport has described some of the difficulties that we might encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a sense of deja vu recalling the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the debate about when an issue is a national issue. I do not think that we have heard a satisfactory answer to that question. The Minister would do well to seek similar guidelines to those that were used by the nature organisations and conservationist bodies when they sought to establish what fulfilled the criteria of being of national importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there are still big gaps in the criteria that we are trying to establish. However, it is a difficult subject and we shall have to leave it to the Minister and hope that he will produce the correct guidelines. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 5, line 4, leave out from 'after' to end of line 5 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'a public inquiry under section 11 of this Act has been held into the proposal in question.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment was tabled on behalf of the Council for the Protection of Rural England. I share the concern of that organisation that clause 9 will reverse the procedures that were originally proposed in the consultation paper. Those proposals envisaged that Parliament would consider and authorise a scheme after a public inquiry had been held. That is the only sensible procedure to follow. Both Houses of Parliament would have available to them full details of the scheme and the inspector's report, and so would have some idea of public opinion about the project.<br><br>
If the procedure set out in clause 9 is not reversed, the public inquiry would be almost in a straightjacket. Its terms of reference would be limited. The project would have been approved in principle, as would the chosen route—or "broadly the chosen option", whatever that may mean. An objector's alternative scheme would receive little consideration and the possibility of there being an inspector's report suggesting that, in principle, the project could not be sustained, is very remote.<br><br>
I note that the Secretary of State would not be able to issue an order that is inconsistent with Parliament's resolution, but that he would not be compelled to make the order. I assume that that means that if an inquiry were to reject the broadly chosen option in favour of another, or none at all, the Secretary of State would have the choice of ignoring the inspector's report and its implications and issuing an order that could ignore the wishes of Parliament. Whichever path he chooses appears to be fraught with danger. The Minister said on Second Reading that one of the reasons for reversing the original recommended procedure was because if Parliament were to refuse a major project, it would be better to do so early on in the procedure rather than waste time, money and energy on a public inquiry.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
If the Secretary of State chooses to overrule the findings of an inquiry—a power that he already has without the Bill—and approves an order, the Government's argument is shot to pieces. Time, energy and public money would still be wasted. It must make sense to introduce a procedure that would allow Parliament to have before it the full facts and implications of any scheme and to know what the public sentiments are before a decision is made. That is the only fair and democratic path to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the amendment. There is a problem in saying that Parliament should decide, but then having a public inquiry and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 198</span>
allowing Parliament no further say. I spoke about what happens under clause 13 when the Minister puts forward an order that varies what the inspector reports. In this country we are involved in a public inquiry in the form of the democratic process in which all the arguments are put forward. If Parliament makes a decision and a whole series of issues are brought out at the public inquiry which were not brought out in the parliamentary debate, Parliament cannot have second thoughts.<br><br>
I can understand the difficulty if, after an entire public inquiry with a favourable inspector's report, Parliament throws it out. All those who advanced arguments at the public inquiry will legitimately feel unfairly done by because Parliament allowed them to go through all the expense of putting forward their case yet vetoed it at the end of the day. I can understand that, but Parliament is about more than having a formal vote on a particular day. It is a question of lobbying and of listening to the arguments. It is worrying that Parliament is now expected to make a decision before all the groups of people who may want to submit evidence have had the opportunity to deploy their arguments and to question witnesses.<br><br>
Once the process has been dealt with by Parliament, there is no opportunity to return to it. If a case is well deployed at a public inquiry and if an inspector says that it can go ahead, but that it needs substantial modifications, and if the Secretary of State then announces that he will take no notice of the modifications recommended by the inspector but will still approve the order, Parliament should have an opportunity to debate it again. I know that I am beginning to encroach on the amendments that have been tabled to clause 13, but the Minister must address the fact that things do not happen on a fixed day. The parliamentary process involves lobbying and the deployment of argument. Much of that is now being handed over to the public inquiry. We should consider a way in which Parliament can have a further say on the issue once all the arguments have been fought over, questioned and scrutinised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important issue, which was discussed at some length on Second Reading. When we originally consulted on the proposals we, too, thought that the affirmative resolution at the end of the process was the right way to proceed, but we have been convinced by consultations that we were wrong. There were several objections to proceeding in that way.<br><br>
First, strategic matters of this sort should be aired in principle before the public inquiry takes place. The Royal Town Planning Institute pressed this on us strongly. The council's tribunals were concerned for their reputation in the public inquiry process. They believed that if Parliament overturned the results of the inquiry, the process would fall into disrepute. Local inquiries are about local issues. The promoters said clearly that in cases where substantial resources were required—even to develop a scheme so that it can be taken through a public inquiry—they would rather know straight away whether or not Parliament was with them in principle. The proposals have emerged in that way.<br><br>
The CPRE and the RSPB have written to us because they are anxious that the procedure will unduly restrict the work of the public inquiry. That would be a fair point if we intended to ask Parliament to endorse the order, but the intention is to put the resolution to Parliament on the principle, leaving the detail to the public inquiry. An
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 199</span>
example may help, although hon. Members must not take my remarks as confirmation that the procedure will be used.<br><br>
The Committee will know about the debate on the route of the channel tunnel rail link. The need for the link is clearly a national matter. The broad decision on which route to take is of national significance because it will be made on a broad judgment about land use, planning and environmental effect. Whether it should cross the River Thames at a particular point and whether it should be a tunnel or a cutting and so on are matters that should be left to the inquiry.<br><br>
The RSPB raised the matter of sites of international significance. We are content to accept that they are sacrosanct once they are declared unless the safety of human life or other important matters supervene. That is one reason why the Rail Europe proposals for the rail link would not have been approved, despite various misleading press reports at the weekend.<br><br>
It might help the Committee if I describe what we propose to do if there is a scheme of national significance. Once the decision is made, copies of the order submitted by the promoters and all the accompanying documents, including the environmental statements, would be deposited in Parliament. Copies of the objections would also be available. A summary of the case for and against the proposals and the alternatives that have been examined would be prepared. In that way, Parliament would have all the information necessary to take an informed decision on the principle. It would not be a leap in the dark, as feared by the CPRE.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister is saying now may be of great importance in a year or two—he knows my constituency—but procedurally, what would be the decision in principle? The channel tunnel link is of particular importance. The principle is a route from somewhere in the King's Cross area to somewhere in north Kent, a fast line from A to B. The proposal will be for a particular route. Will Parliament decide on the need or upon that particular route? They are two very different matters, as the Minister knows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking me to tell him what will be the wording of the motion that Parliament debates with the scheme comes into being. I cannot today give him the wording of that resolution. However, he is right to say that a decision has been taken that the link would be desirable. It is a question of where that link should go. I cannot say exactly where it will be, but we see the resolution as a line of route expressing a general corridor into the area. That general corridor would not be definitive—there may be variations as a result of local representations and the public inquiry. I hope that I have helped the hon. Gentleman. It is difficult to describe the order in detail. We might spend some time drafting the resolution and I could then write to the hon. Gentleman in broader terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. This is classic Standing Committee procedure. Is not this the dilemma that I described in our debate on amendments Nos. 52 and 114, which dealt with maps and property? Whichever corridor route for the channel link is agreed, the important questions for an inquiry will be the nature, place and effect of the work proposed.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but to reach agreement in principle Parliament would need a description of the line's effect. It would be neither possible nor desirable for the House to produce such a description in every detail. That is a matter for the public inquiry and the people who make representations to it. The promoters will furnish details, including maps and environmental assessments, about their proposed scheme. The desirability or otherwise of changes to their plans could be argued at the public inquiry.<br><br>
I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Newham, South about a scheme that will have a great impact on his constituency, but we are trying to ensure that as well as a parliamentary stage, there is a stage when local people, local authorities and other statutory bodies can make their case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend the Minister, who is being most helpful. I was glad to hear his comments about Rail Europe. I agree absolutely that it stood no chance of success. However, when my hon. Friend spoke about the probability that the high-speed rail link would be presented to the House in terms of a broad corridor that would gain approval in principle, did he mean that the inquiry and the subsequent order could not deviate from that corridor without additional parliamentary approval? Or will the public inquiry have a free hand to produce significant changes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is something that we shall examine further, and I shall have more to say about it later. Obviously, Parliament would make a specific response to a specific resolution. If, as a result of matters raised in representations and at the inquiry, a significant change were proposed, the Secretary of State would have to consider whether he could make a resolution that was completely outside what Parliament had laid down.<br><br>
I do not think that that would happen, and the result may be that another public inquiry would have to be held. However, that could be avoided if some way could be found to change the original resolution or the principle behind it. It may be agreed that that is the best way to go, instead of returning to square one. A large proportion of the route may be agreed, but some changes may have to be made. Such a change need not reflect substantial disagreement, but may in itself involve substantial amendment to the route.<br><br>
Amendment No. 124 would not work. If we were to defer Parliament's decision to the end of the process, the Secretary of State would have to have made a decision in the light of the inspector's report before asking for Parliament's endorsement. It is a well-established principle that he should not listen to arguments from one side without giving an opportunity to the other side to counter them. If we had the parliamentary debate after the inquiry and before the decision, he would be doing just that. There would be some doubt as to whether the requirements of the environmental impact assessment directive had been properly fulfilled.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. I think that it is right in principle that Parliament should express a view on these very important schemes before the local inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not very happy with the Minister's reply. I would like to take him through a specific example. There is a good chance that some time in the next 20 years a tidal power scheme will be proposed for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
Mersey. That will divide people. The Minister may say that he does not consider that such a scheme would be of national significance. I shall not go back over that argument, so let us assume that the Minister concedes that the scheme would be of national significance. On one side there would be those people who see the scheme as an environmentally friendly way to generate power and to regenerate some of the lower Mersey basin; those arguing against might be concerned about the natural habitats of birds and other creatures or about rights of navigation.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
Let us suppose those arguments were deployed in Parliament. The promoters of the Bill would claim that they had safeguarded navigation rights and that there would be one or two locks so that boats could continue to get through without any difficulty. They might also claim that they had examined the environmental questions and that the range of tidal limits would not be so restricted that the feeding grounds for birds would be greatly affected. Parliament might decide that the scheme could go forward, and a public inquiry would then be held. At the public inquiry it might be demonstrated that the promoters of the Bill made bad mistakes and that their experts were wrong about the possibility of getting boats through the locks, and about the flow. A substantial flaw might be revealed when the experts were tested under cross-examination.<br><br>
After the public inquiry, the inspector might believe that the promoters did not have all the technical details correct and might recommend that the scheme be approved, but that certain amendments must be made—for example, a third lock must be added to the barrier. That might entail considerable expense. The Secretary of State might consider that recommendation and decide that he would not accept the inspector's recommendation, but that he would accept the scheme as Parliament first approved it.<br><br>
If Members of Parliament had been listening to the main thrust of the arguments at the public inquiry and to the technical details, such as the capacity of the locks or the tidal range, brought out by the experts, they would be convinced that the original decision was wrong. At that stage, Members of Parliament should have some opportunity to express that opinion. I know that I am venturing towards discussion of clause 13, but that would be the problem caused by the Government changing the procedure that was put forward at the original consultation.<br><br>
The original consultation resulted in the decision that Members of Parliament would have the opportunity to listen to the arguments deployed at the public inquiry, to hear the expert witnesses, and then to make a judgment. The Government are now saying that they prefer Members of Parliament to make up their minds without the full, tested information. I can understand why Ministers would prefer Members of Parliament to be blindfolded when they are making a decision, but that is a cynical point. Members of Parliament should be fully informed and Ministers should accept that. We all know that promoters of a scheme can produce a technical splurge that looks impressive to us as laypeople, but in which other people can soon see the flaws.<br><br>
If the Government want the public inquiry process to be an informative one, in which all the arguments are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
tested, it is a little unfair to say that Members of Parliament should not be able to take any notice of what might have emerged at that public inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to "the original consultation". Is he telling the Committee that it was the recommendation of the Private Bill Procedure Joint Select Committee that the procedure should be different from that which the Government are proposing? Is he suggesting that there be a double procedure with assent at the start and assent subsequently for schemes of national significance, but only one assent at the end of the procedure for other schemes? Was that the Select Committee's recommendation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Select Committee recommendation was that, at the end of the process, Parliament would decide. The Minister has suggested that that be reversed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of accuracy, the Select Committee made no recommendations about schemes of national significance. That is an important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the Government's original consultation rather than the Select Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by the Minister's argument or the fact that he read from two pages of typewritten script. Perhaps my amendment was getting at the intention of the Bill. The Minister implied that he would have more to say later. I hope that on Report there will be some sort of rejigging of the wording, because it is very loose.<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 79, in clause 13, page 8, line 16, at end insert—

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to provide an opportunity for us to hear from the Minister

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
about the timetable of the determination process. I wish to speak to amendment No. 67—and, thanks to the physical adroitness of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North—a comment which I hope she will not take amiss—I now have the appropriate brief.<br><br>
Amendment No. 67 would enable one of the rules made by the Secretary of State under clause 10 to cover the timetable for the determination of applications for orders under this Bill. It is essentially a probing amendment designed to provide an opportunity for an initial debate on a subject raised by several hon. Members on Second Reading.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the Minister said that the Bill was not being introduced
<br><blockquote><p>"primarily to speed up the process of approving works, but it is important that we do not slow them down."</p></blockquote>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore hold to the view, advanced in the consultation document, that projects which are progressed by order will, on the whole, take no longer than private Bills and that the smaller ones will progress much more quickly."</p></blockquote>
That objective will be achieved only if the procedures involved in the order-making process—particularly inquiries, hearings and the handling of written representations—are operated efficiently. It is important that there are no major delays between the holding of an inquiry or hearing and the announcement of the Secretary of State's decision.<br><br>
The length of time involved will reasonably vary from scheme to scheme, making the inclusion of a time scale in the Bill difficult and potentially counter-productive. The key issue for the promoter of, for example, a light rail scheme is a reliable indication of how long the order-making procedure will take. Those of us who have been involved with the Midland Metro scheme will echo those sentiments. That could be achieved if a timetable was agreed with the promoter once the application was submitted and objections or comments received.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the Minister also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The suggestion that the Secretary of State should have to adhere to a timetable is an interesting one".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 2 December 1991; Vol. 200, c. 41.]</p></blockquote>
He said that he would look at it closely. After the Christmas and new year celebrations, the Minister may have forgotten that he said that.<br><br>
Closing the debate, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We shall have to consider that issue in Committee. Some difficulties may be encountered"—</p></blockquote>
It is not unusual for Ministers to say that. I suppose that it depends on how highly raised are the eyebrows of those who advised them when the original comment was made. The Minister said that some difficulties may be encountered.
<br><blockquote><p>"over imposing strict time limits on how long the Secretary of State may have to consider inspectors' reports."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 2 December 1991; Vol. 200, c. 75–76.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that having reflected on his own wise words on Second Reading, the Minister will tell us that we were right to raise that point on Second Reading and that it is so eminently sensible that he is prepared to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 79 in my name, which has been selected for debate with amendment No. 67. The principles of the two amendments are broadly the same. I echo the remark of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) that although the intention
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
of the Bill is not necessarily to speed up the planning process, it is certainly not its intention to slow that process down.<br><br>
In some cases, private legislation can take a very long time and there is no certainty about the speed with which it will pass through the House. However, many of the less controversial proposals, once the promoter has put them into a Bill are likely to complete their passage through the House within 12 months. Then the promoter—British Rail, for example—can get on with tasks that are in the general interest. It would be undesirable to adopt a planning system whereby Ministers or Departments, because of pressure of work or other worthy reasons, sat on matters for five or six months and caused unnecessary delay. Therefore, to include some sort of timetable in the Bill is an attractive idea.<br><br>
I was surprised, when, on Second Reading, the Opposition spokesmen confirmed their adherence to a timetable principle. I wondered whether they had talked to their environmental spokesmen and had general acceptance of the idea that the Department of the Environment and other Departments should be obliged to respond within a certain time. I was even more surprised to hear fairly sympathetic words from my hon. Friend the Minister. Much encouraged, I was very pleased to attach my name to amendment No. 79. It emanates, quite rightly, from British Rail, which has an interest in getting through such applications. They are not necessarily controversial or ones that arouse objections; they are needed to build and improve railways and other works.<br><br>
The amendment that I have tabled suggests that when an application is unopposed, it should be determined within four months. That does not seem an unreasonable amount of time. The amendment further suggests that when an application has been opposed and has gone before a public inquiry, the Secretary of State should make a determination within six months. It can be assumed that an opposed case is more controversial and might take longer to resolve.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will say that there is a way of incorporating into the Bill or the rules some kind of timetable, either specific or in the form of guidelines, that can be used as pressure or discipline on the Department involved, on the planning system, or to help the promoters. It is an important principle and it would be helpful if it could be incorporated into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the concern shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and the Opposition about the time scales for decisions. That issue is also very much in the minds of those who have been involved in the promotion of private Bills.<br><br>
However, the proposal to introduce mandatory time limits on decisions made by the Secretary of State will not only be unlikely to achieve the desired effect, but could be counter-productive. As I said on Second Reading, the Government have no interest in delaying decisions on what will often be important new infrastructure schemes. On the other hand, it will be crucial that the Secretary of State makes the right decision because of its potential effect on many public and private interests. I fear that there is a potential contradiction between the idea of imposing a time limit on the making of decisions by the Secretary of State and the amendments that we considered earlier, which were motivated, quite properly, by a desire to give full protection to those interests.<br><br>

6.30 pm<br><br>
I recognise that the proposal put forward in amendment No. 67 aims for flexibility by leaving the timetable to be settled by agreement after the close of the objection period. Nevertheless, the proposal still raises difficult issues of principle. If, for example, the Secretary of State makes himself subject to a statutory deadline for deciding an application, even if he discusses the timetable with the parties to an application, he may lay himself open to the criticism that he has not properly considered all the evidence in a case. That could well lead to a challenge of his decision in the courts on the ground that he had fettered his discretion by giving priority to meeting the deadline. Litigation in those circumstances would, of course, extend considerably the time taken to conclude the proceedings. If it succeeded, the inquiry would have to be re-opened.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has, I know, considered at length the question of time limiting his decisions on planning cases. He has firmly rejected the idea because of the point about natural justice. Decisions should take as long as they have to in order to give all factors full and proper consideration. Furthermore, there is no reasonable sanction which could be applied to the Secretary of State if he failed to reach a decision within a stipulated period. To force him into an improperly considered decision would be unfair to one side or the other.<br><br>
Putting questions of principle to one side, I do not believe that amendment No. 67 would work in practice. Even after the close of the objection period, the Secretary of State would not be in a position to offer to objectors and applicants any more than a tentative timetable for the future proceedings. I suspect that in most cases he would have to amend any timetable that he had agreed to take account of developments that he had been unable to predict in the course of the proceedings.<br><br>
Amendment No. 79, proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham, falls foul of the same consideration about natural justice as amendment No. 67. In practical terms, I fear also that it is not sufficiently flexible to cater for some cases where the scale and complexity of a proposal demands longer than the prescribed period for the Secretary of State to reach his decision. Even where an order is not opposed, there might be complex issues about the merits of a proposal to be considered and discussed with other interested parties, which could make the proposed four month time limit impracticable.<br><br>
While I sympathise with the aims of amendments Nos. 67 and 79, I have concluded that this matter is not suitable for statutory attention. However, I am prepared to consider the publication of guidelines relating to time scales for determining orders that may not be dissimilar to those proposed in amendment No. 79. But the Secretary of State could not be bound by them for the reasons that I have already given.<br><br>
Where statutory time limits have been found useful for planning inquiries—for example, in setting deadlines on the exchange of evidence between parties to an inquiry—I agree that it would be sensible to make similar provision for inquiries into the new orders. However, even the pre-inquiry timetable for planning inquiries is not treated as an absolute requirement. I understand that in many cases it proves impossible to meet the target dates set out in the regulations and they have to be extended.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
I am sure that some constituents have come to hon. Members because they have fallen foul of the time-scale. Some hon. Members have written to the Secretary of State to ask him to request the inspector to consider late applications. The Government are quite clear that it will be in the interests of everybody to deal promptly with all stages of the new procedure. I trust that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East will therefore agree to withdraw the amendment. There is no desire by the Government to try to spin out the applications for any longer than necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that it is not the desire of the Government to spin out matters, but we all know how frustrating it can be when we have waited for months—sometimes years—for decisions to be made, even though the delay may be justified because the matter is complex. However, I find it hard to believe that after four or six months' of waiting such matters cannot be determined, although I fully understand the need for flexibility. By definition, every matter is different and I appreciate the weight that my hon. Friend the Minister attaches to his argument.<br><br>
I welcome his statement that guidelines will be available that will effectively apply some form of timetabling. That will be helpful and I should like to know whether those guidelines will be available before Report, or at least before the Bill reaches its final stages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Faversham, I also accept the Minister's assurances. I am sorry that an idea that, on Second Reading, the Minister described as "interesting" now sounds less interesting and less possible. However, the Minister mellowed somewhat towards the end of his speech, and we are grateful for that.<br><br>
I was amused by the Minister's comment that a Secretary of State would "have no interest whatever in unduly delaying a decision." It is a reckless Minister who says such things in an election year. We can readily imagine a politically embarrassing application sitting on the Secretary of State's desk until after the election, in which case he would not need to worry about it. We can envisage the sort of situation that the Minister—unwisely, in my view—described as "very unlikely".<br><br>
However, on the half-a-loaf principle I shall go along with the hon. Member for Faversham and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 5, line 31, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Subject to subsection (3) below, nothing in this section or in rules made under this section or in section 21 below shall limit the right of any person to object to an application under section 6 above or to a proposal to make an order by virtue of section 7 above.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 68, in page 5, line 31, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Any rules made by the Secretary of State under this section shall be published.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments are clear. In amendment No. 8 we ask the Secretary of State to confirm that the right of a person to object to any application under clause 6 will not be unduly prejudiced by clause 10.<br><br>
Amendment No. 68 is self-explanatory. We expect any rules made by the Secretary of State under clause 10 to be published.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0722">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
Given the reasonable nature of the amendments—and the reasonable way in which I have moved them—I hope that the Minister's placatory attitude on the previous group of amendments will be repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East wants to safeguard the interests of those who may be affected by the proposals. However, the amendment is superfluous. Nothing in the clause lends itself to bring interpreted as restricting the right to object to proposals. Indeed, the whole tenor of the clause is to the opposite effect. Moreover, the Government have no intention of making rules that would restrict the right of anybody with something relevant to contribute to the consideration of proposals to present his evidence—indeed, that is a feature of the Bill as opposed to the existing private Bill procedure—as that would be contrary to the well-established principles of natural justice and would fall foul of the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not there a conflict between clause 10 and clause 21 in that respect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to clause 21 later. If we reach it today, I shall look forward to answering the hon. Gentleman's question then.<br><br>
The courts would undoubtedly support persons whose interests had been prejudiced by the restriction of their ability to give evidence, even if that had been sanctioned by the inquiry procedure rules. We have received representations from various bodies that, for the new procedure to work efficiently, there needs to be some limitation on the making of objections. That could, for example, take the form of imposing a strict time limit on the making of objections after which any objections would be disregarded; or there could be provision to exclude from speaking at an inquiry anybody who had not previously submitted a written objection. While I have some sympathy with the reasoning behind such suggestions, I am sure that they would in fact be counterproductive in terms of time scales for reaching decisions on applications. There would always be a real risk of litigation when a Secretary of State did not ensure that he was in possession of all relevant evidence relating to a proposal.<br><br>
I must point out that the purpose of clause 21 is to make it clear that certain statutory bodies have the same rights, in respect of orders as they have on private Bills. I had to say that to ensure that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish was aware that I knew exactly what he was going to say.<br><br>
The draft application rules which I have circulated to the Committee have followed the principles established in existing models. I assure hon. Members that we shall do the same for the inquiry procedure rules and that we shall continue to discuss them with the Council on Tribunals.<br><br>
On amendment No. 68, it surely goes without saying that if the new order-making procedure is to work properly and fairly, all the relevant procedural rules will have to be readily available to anyone who has an interest in the process. That object will be formally achieved by the publication of the statutory instruments containing the rules in the annual edition of statutory instruments. Rules about objections are, of course, of general application and will have to be classified accordingly under the statutory instruments regulations.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
In addition to that formal arrangement, it will make obvious sense for those processing applications to ensure that the procedural rules are well known to applicants and objectors alike, otherwise it would only cause unnecessary disruption for all involved. Given those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not feel it necessary to press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances. On amendment No. 68, the Minister said that the rules would be published anyway. He must forgive me for returning to that point, especially in relation to clause 21. I suspect that he was as surprised as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish to find the reply in his brief. Perhaps he should insist on a little cross-referencing when information on such matters is passed to him. What he said meets the intention of the amendments and, for that reason, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 5, line 36, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) The Secretary of State shall not make a determination under section 13(1) below without first taking into account the policies of any adopted development plan within whose area the proposal in question falls.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is another plea to the Minister to give due consideration to an adopted development plan within the area of the proposal before he makes a determination. It makes eminent sense for the Minister to agree to the amendment. If he is not prepared to accept it, I shall be intrigued to hear his excuses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the anxiety of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East that planning issues should not be overlooked when the Secretary of State considers applications for orders. That is why, even before an application for an order is made, we are providing in rules for consultation with the local planning authority and for a certificate of the planning position to be submitted, including what the development plan says. That will, of course, be very important if the Secretary of State is asked to direct that planning permission be deemed to be granted, using his power to do so under clause 16.<br><br>
I am confident that the combined effect of the Bill's provisions and those of the procedure rules will ensure that that eventuality could not occur. Local planning authorities will receive notice of application for orders in their areas; they will be able to object to proposals, for example, if they conflict with their planning policies. Clause 10(2) requires the Secretary of State to consider all objections, and under clause 11(3) local planning authorities will be able to insist on holding an inquiry or hearing. There is thus no way that the adopted development plan of an area could not become a relevant matter for the Secretary of State to consider when he comes to decide on the application.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
Where it is the Secretary of State for Transport who is responsible for deciding on an application, he will naturally want to consult the Secretary of State for the Environment about the planning implications of a scheme. That Department holds the relevant expertise in that area and it is unthinkable that it would not be consulted.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
Acceptance of the amendment would secure nothing that will not already be bound to happen under the new procedure. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say, in response to that helpful contribution, that if that is the case, why not give us a victory, albeit a pyrrhic one, by accepting the amendment? In the spirit in which the Minister replied, I accept that the amendment's purpose is covered in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 6, line 11, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>'approved by Resolution of both Houses of Parliament.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 118, in page 6, line 11, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>'which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a lively, rapid and fruitful exchange on the procedures that the Minister intends to adopt for applications and their examination. People will have to look at a great deal of small print when the system comes into operation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 70 is simple, but may go too far for the Minister. It would bring Parliament into the affair by making the rules that the Secretary of State will make subject to being
<br><blockquote><p>"approved by Resolution of both Houses of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
That is an affirmative order and may go too far for the Minister. However, in the light of the precedents that we have discussed today, I hope that he will agree that Parliament should have an opportunity, albeit by means of a prayer, to scrutinise the rules, which could be consolidated or improved by such a procedure. The fact that the rules had been subject to such scrutiny could make them better understood and perhaps help the inspector—he could say that they had been approved by Parliament and no one could disagree. I hope that the Minister will consider the matter and accept this amendment, or an amendment that would make the rules subject to annulment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 118 does exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South suggested by proposing the negative procedure to deal with the matter. We must judge between the negative and affirmative procedures. Affirmative instruments, where a resolution is on the Order Paper and the instrument must receive a majority to come into affect, should be reserved for more important matters. The making of rules covering objections is a less important matter in the context of administration and parliamentary accountability. It is important that there should be such accountability because the rules will govern the method whereby people can make valid objections.<br><br>
Rather than allowing a statutory instrument to be produced without further parliamentary scrutiny, it would be preferable to make it subject to the negative procedure, especially in cases where the Minister has the right to waive those rules and dispense with any compliance that he thinks suitable. As we have happily hammered home during the Committee's proceedings, we are more aware of the importance of scrutinising delegated legislation. I am happy that the Minister is doing things such as referring to the index of statutory instruments in an attempt to justify
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
instruments that undergo no further parliamentary procedure and suggest that there is some sort of reference to Parliament. All that is good because it is part of an increased awareness of the great importance and spread of statutory instruments.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will make another gesture in the direction of accountability. People will have to make objections under the rules and they are, therefore, important. The public uses statutory instruments. That is why such instruments have an explanatory note at the end, again to help people, as a matter of common form. A statutory instrument with an attached explanatory note would help rather than hinder people who want to object and I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The mere prospect of upsetting the hon. Member for Bradford, South is such that I could almost believe that he should be employed part time as a parliamentary consultant to the Department of Transport, given the way in which I accepted some of his earlier amendments; but I know the depth of his distaste for Members of Parliament who do two jobs. I recall that at one time he was also a Member of the European Parliament—he clearly did not mind doing two jobs himself then.<br><br>
I have already said that I am prepared to accept amendment No. 25, which applies annulment procedure to the rules about application procedure. It makes obvious sense to accept the same point in the context of rules about objections to be made under clause 10. The Committee will no doubt have noticed from the draft rules which I have circulated that we intend to cover application and objection procedures in one instrument, so I could hardly do anything but accept amendment No. 118. I hope that on that basis the hon. Member for Newham, South will be prepared to withdraw his amendment No. 70, to facilitate my acceptance of amendment No. 118.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In certain circumstances, I should be only too willing to withdraw the amendment, as I made clear in my earlier remarks. I am glad that the Minister has taken the sensible option of accepting amendment No. 118 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South.<br><br>
If I ask leave to withdraw my amendment No. 70, Mr. Latham, will it then be open to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South to move amendment No. 118?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is exactly what will happen. If the hon. Member for Newham, South gains the Committee's leave to withdraw amendment No. 70, I shall invite the hon. Member for Bradford, South to move amendment No. 118 formally. It will then be for the Committee to decide whether it should be accepted.</span></p>

<p>No. 72, in page 6, line 36, at end insert', a Passenger Transport Authority'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 9 is designed to allow a local authority adjacent to an authority affected by an application also to object. There are cases when such a provision would be essential, especially when major works are involved. Occasionally, local authorities have difficulty in deciding their joint reaction to proposed major works. Sometimes that is due to political differences between then and sometimes to an authority's parochial belief that an application is purely its own affair and that the views of adjacent authorities need not be considered.<br><br>
A spirit of co-operation seems to have struck the Committee today and I hope that, in that spirit, the Minister will see the sense of amendment No. 9.<br><br>
The other amendments in the group outline the number of bodies that should be consulted. Many of them have made representations to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee expressing their understandable ire at the lack of previous consultation over matters in the Bill which directly affect them. Some of the statutory bodies were created by Governments of both political parties specifically for that purpose. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments and assure us that henceforth the bodies will be properly consulted.<br><br>
In relation to amendment No. 72, under the Bill as drafted, consultation can take place with the passenger transport executive. The Minister is aware that another elected body, the passenger transport authority, is directly involved. Clause 11 requires the Secretary of State to call an inquiry or a hearing into an application for an order when a local authority whose area is affected by the proposed scheme objects. There is a list of authorities, to which I referred, but that list includes passenger transport executives, not passenger transport authorities. We are keen to see elected local representatives of any political party or of none on the ballot paper, although those of no political persuasion usually hold right-wing views, whatever the label, or lack of it, on the ballot paper.<br><br>
The PTAs' overall policy and responsibility is to set public transport policies for the area that they serve. They work closely with the PTEs and set the policy framework within which the passenger transport executives operate. It is important that the Bill should provide for the PTA to comment on the application and for an objection from a PTA to trigger an inquiry or a hearing. The voices of elected members of PTAs are at least as important as those of appointed officials who serve on what we believe should be the subordinate body—the passenger transport executive.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The privilege of being able to insist on the holding of a public inquiry is one that we believe should be fairly narrowly drawn because it will not always be necessary to subject proposals to public scrutiny to enable the Secretary of State to reach a properly informed decision. In general, we think that the Secretary of State will be in the best position to assess the need for an inquiry, but where the interests of any person or body are directly or specifically affected by proposals in a draft order, it would be entirely reasonable to allow them the right to insist on having an opportunity to argue their case against the proposals and to test the case of the applicants in a public forum.<br><br>
The local authorities to which clause 4(a) relates are the ones which are usually responsible for determining planning applications in their area. There is a compelling case for giving this privilege to those authorities because of their statutory responsibilities for development planning and control and because of the provisions in clause 16 to empower the Secretary of State to give directions that planning permission be deemed to be granted for the making of an order. It is wholly appropriate to confer on those authorities the right to insist on the holding of an inquiry or hearing at which they could set forth their views about the planning implications of a proposal, informed as they would be by their detailed knowledge of local conditions and planning policies.<br><br>
Other local authorities and the various statutory bodies mentioned in amendments Nos. 71 and 116 may, of course, have relevant evidence which they want to put to the Secretary of State. Certainly where this evidence concerns matters of significant public interest he would be unlikely to refuse a request to hold a public inquiry, but we believe that it would be unfair to subject applicants for orders to the delay and expense of an inquiry if the substance of an objection did not warrant it. In these cases I am sure that the assessment of the need for an inquiry would be best left to the Secretary of State: he would be in possession of all the objections to an order and of all the supporting evidence provided by the applicants from which to judge the extent to which an inquiry would be a useful means to gather further information and to test the weight of the respective arguments. It must be absolutely clear who is to be regarded as having the statutory right to demand an inquiry. Amendment No. 9 would leave it unclear. Amendment No. 10 would in a similar way expand, possibly greatly, the requirements for publicity of a decision, but how far might be very unclear.<br><br>
Amendment No. 116 has been dealt with in substance during our discussions of the position of the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council. I am still considering an appropriate amendment preserving part VII of the 1968 Act, the provisions of which give IWAAC's constituent bodies a right to an inquiry if the closure of a waterway is contemplated.<br><br>
But let us put this in perspective. All schemes involving compulsory purchase of land are likely to have an inquiry or hearing and it is difficult to perceive of any new railway, tramway or waterway development of any size not involving land acquisition. Moreover, a Secretary of State is very unlikely to determine any scheme without an inquiry if he has received representations from statutory bodies on matters concerning the order which they consider are prejudicial to their interests.<br><br>

7 pm<br><br>
I hope that my comments have gone some way towards reassuring Opposition Members. On Amendment No. 72, we decided that it would be more fitting for passenger transport executives, rather than passenger transport authorities, to be the bodies which are to be given the right to insist on the holding of an inquiry or hearing, because it is the executives which will be responsible for promoting and opposing orders. The executives operate within a policy framework determined by the authorities, so if any authority wished to oppose a scheme promoted by a private company affecting its area, it should be able to voice that opposition through the executive. The addition of passenger transport authorities to clause 11(4) would therefore be superfluous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee either. I was disappointed for other reasons with the Minister's reply. The clause gives a statutory right, in effect, for certain narrowly drawn local authorities to require a public inquiry. The Minister's objection to the range of amendments that we have tabled is that he does not wish to extend the right. He bases that on the ground that the authorities he has named in the Bill are, in planning terms, the planning authorities for the area which would be involved in a call-in inquiry under planning legislation.<br><br>
The example that my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) gave of two adjacent local authorities made the case very strongly for amendment No. 9. It is not unknown for people to bargain on this. They are told that if they do not ask for a public inquiry they will be given it. There should be a right for people who are prejudicially affected to call for one, particularly if they are statutory bodies that are created to protect certain interests.<br><br>
It would be wrong for the Minister to say that the Countryside Commission, English Heritage, the Countryside Council for Wales, the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council or the passenger transport authority are to be debarred from calling for a public inquiry. That is what the Minister said. It can only add to the suspicion that the Secretary of State is being given too much power here. It would surely be right for statutory bodies to be able to reassure people by calling for a public inquiry. What is the Minister afraid of?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends, I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) was so disappointed that he promoted him twice in his speech. My hon. Friend is right to talk about the tensions and conflicts that can arise between local authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South referred to the trading between local authorities, behind closed doors of course. Such trade-offs may be detrimental.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, to the inhabitants. Regrettably, we must accept that that occurs. I do not understand the Minister's reluctance regarding the passenger transport authorities. He said that such matters are more fitting for the passenger transport executive, but did not tell us why. Some of us have long been unhappy about the relationship between PTEs and PTAs. Although it is not yet official Labour party policy, I hope that we can secure an agreement that the PTEs will be seen as the executive arm
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
of the passenger transport authority, working directly and responding to the decision-making processes of that elected body, regardless of the political hue of the members of the authority. We believe that elected members, rather than officials, are the best people to make those representations.<br><br>
I am fascinated that the Minister say again that the decisions are best left to the Secretary of State. After the opinion polls over the weekend I looked at the majorities of Ministers in the Department of Transport. It would appear that the Minister is likely to be the only survivor after the general election. I hope that the Conservative party uses his knowledge in Opposition and I look forward to him telling my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), who will be Secretary of State, that he is the best person to take those decisions. I have a feeling that the Minister may live to regret those words.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 7, line 4, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(7) Any body which, by virtue of Standing Order 95 (Private Business) of the House of Commons, would be granted <i>locus standi</i> in relation to an application made under sections 1 and 3 of this Act, shall be entitled to present evidence to any public inquiry held under this section.'.</p></blockquote>
We are anxious to see that those who, by virtue of Standing Order No. 95, would be granted locus standi in relation to an application do not find themselves worse off in making that application under the Bill. I hope that the Minister can reassure us on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLouglin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not attempt to replicate the locus standi provisions in Standing Orders, as proposed in amendment No. 76. In the interests of natural justice, any person or body will be able to give evidence to an inquiry if they have something relevant to say. There will be no equivalent to the Court of Referees on private Bills, which decides who should be entitled to give evidence. Nor would we want such a system because, unlike private Bills, those decisions could be challenged in the courts. We do not want a hint of a restriction on those entitled to appear at a public inquiry, other than the one in clause 11(3). Amendment No. 76 is unnecessary and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Faced with such a persuasive argument, I can do no less. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have doubts about the inclusion of the clause. I understand that it relates to the well-known—or, perhaps, little-known—procedure that deals with the protection of national parks. I understand the logic of its purpose, but it seems to strip away protection, which might otherwise be afforded, by a rarely used and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
important procedure of the House. Therefore, without necessarily wishing to divide the Committee, I express some doubts about its appropriateness in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the clause does that. As a Member of Parliament whose constituency includes part of an interesting and outstandingly beautiful national park, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I do not wish to do anything that would put such places in danger. Perhaps I should write to the hon. Gentleman to reassure him about that.</span></p>
