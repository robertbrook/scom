</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are about to embark upon the first major debate on part II of the Bill which is necessary because of the Government's proposed changes. They would bring into range an entirely different set of considerations that might otherwise be dealt with by a Home Office Bill and a Committee selected for the purpose. I am not a specialist in, nor do I have knowledge of, the issues dealt with in this part of the Bill relating to alcohol taken by people in charge of trains, trams, buses or other public service vehicles that may run on those systems.<br><br>
However, this may be a good qualification for all of us who do not have the specialist knowledge of my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) because we are all potential passengers, so are able to represent the interests of our constituents in a more fundamental way than on other parts of the Bill on which we spoke as parliamentarians.<br><br>
Clause 28 would bring the rules for drink driving by people in charge of public vehicles broadly into line with those pertaining to car drivers. The Minister nods assent. On the face of it, this is a sensible move because, since Barbara Castle introduced breath tests in the late 1960s, there has been at least a legal anomaly between drivers of road vehicles and drivers of tracked vehicles on railways.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
The Government are proposing a curious inversion of the law whereby historically, the rules for drivers of trains, trams or other public service vehicles was rightly more stringent, if anything, than those that applied in any respect to drivers of private road vehicles.<br><br>
That proposed inversion of the de jure position is perhaps made acceptable by the rules of employment of such people—especially drivers.<br><br>
The interesting feature of clause 28 and subsequent clauses is that they may involve people on the permanent way, those involved with signals, those supplying electricity to vehicles or people involved in coupling or uncoupling vehicles and so on. The scope of the clause reaches wider than drivers of road vehicles. It would bring them into line with provisions relating to alcohol in the blood discovered by test and, I presume, to many other complex matters relating to testing, hospitals, the police and so on. This is a complex subject for those with merely a passing knowledge of the issues and has been the focus of much discussion, as no doubt it will continue to be.<br><br>
The issue that we must decide is whether the proposals are to parallel to a reasonable degree categories of person and quantities of alcohol. Is there to be a scaling down of the quantity of alcohol? We have a range of amendments that would scale down quantity; my amendment would provide that no alcohol should be discernible.<br><br>
There is a good and logical case for such a provision for drivers and many of the other categories referred to in clause 28. I believe that the public would not find it acceptable if the rules of London Transport or other public transport services allowed bus or coach drivers, who may drive on motorways or around Parliament square, or underground train drivers or guards, to have measurable alcohol in their bodies. I do not believe that anyone would disagree with that. Should the de jure law be brought into line with the de facto rules and made more stringent? I suggest that it should. I suspect that, in the not-too-distant future, a private Member's Bill or legislation introduced by a future Home Secretary will reduce to zero the allowable levels of alcohol of road users. I understand that such a law operates in Sweden and there is an increasing movement in this country—perhaps throughout the world—for a similar law.<br><br>
We are discussing those who work on railways, tramways, trolleyways and other scientific ways. I am not sure if the proposals will apply to the skippers of boats on navigable waterways. I suppose that they would if such a boat were inside a harbour. From reading clause 27 I am not sure that the Bill will apply to waterways—perhaps we can clarify that issue.<br><br>
I shall quote from an article in <i>The Independent</i> of 24 December by the medical editor, Celia Hall. It quotes the research of—perhaps appropriately—Scottish reporters. If the report is accurate, we should take note. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Drivers who have drunk sparingly and would pass the breath test are still more at risk of having accidents, Scottish researchers said yesterday.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>After drinking two or three units of alcohol—for the research, a pint-and-a-half of ordinary strengh beer—men's responses to sudden events were 10 to 15 per cent. slower than those who were alcohol-free.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Even after two hours, when blood alcohol levels had almost returned to normal, the slow response rate continued."</p></blockquote>
The article describes tests that were carried out and quotes the comments of Dr. Richard Hammersley, lecturer with the behavioural sciences group at the university of Glasgow:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Basically what we are saying is that people might be OK on an uneventful drive home. But when something unexpected happens then they do less well. In practice they might get away with it or they might not."</p></blockquote>
Professor Keith Miller, head of the department, is quoted as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Even quite small doses of alcohol can have marked effects on drivers.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>More alarming still is the variation between individuals in their reaction to alcohol. This makes it very difficult to predict the impact of the drug. The idea that there is a 'safe' legal limit is a nonsense."</p></blockquote>
They are medical opinions and I do not say that hon. Members should accept them. However, the issue could be examined. It is a prima facie case of the zero option, to use a term from a different field of endeavour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to my hon. Friend's remarks, but will he bear in mind the fact that the rate of alcoholism among doctors is one of the highest in any profession in the United Kingdom? So not all doctors will believe the studies to which he has just referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The doctors' profession is not the only one that is cited in the press as being subject to such a risk. I am rather surprised by my hon. Friend's intervention because, whatever rate of alcoholism may occur in certain professions, I should not have thought that people's professional integrity would be affected by what could be called an "occupational risk". Indeed, the reverse might be true. It could apply to politicians and journalists, too.<br><br>
I understand my hon. Friend's point. I am not saying that the amendment is something that should necessarily go unchallenged. But when there is a danger of something going wrong, we must minimise the risk. Indeed, many years ago someone whom I knew well died as a result of someone else's over-indulgence. That a train driver can jump into his car after coming off duty, having consumed a couple of pints in the social club that may be attached to the depot, and be within the law constitutes an anomaly.<br><br>
However, the reverse of that might apply. Let us suppose that the company rules state that a train driver must not consume alcohol for a certain number of hours before going on duty. Whatever those X hours might be, he could still be within the company rules and within the law, yet still have measureable quantities of alcohol in his body. If so, passengers might take exception to that, and we must not tolerate such a position. Indeed, I suspect that under the present law, it would be tolerable. Such matters cannot be defined precisely. But surely a rule of no discernible alcohol being consumed would be a rule that is understood and would give passengers and others some assurance and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but, as I said, the debate is, in a sense, a mini Second Reading of such a complex topic. I am simply putting forward certain principles in the hope that someone will challenge them. Perhaps my hon. Friend wishes to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'> I was wondering how long after people had consumed alcohol before going on a shift would the minimal signs begin to show. My hon. Friend referred to the current rules. It is important that guidance is issued to railway workers on the lengths of time after which they have a drink before they can go to work.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-West (Mr. Barnes) referred to a matter of detail. Despite knowing that such a point might be made, I do not know what the railway rule books state. They might cover various types of food, alcohol and habits. A driver could well be within the company rules if he had consumed on duty and still come within the Bill; I do not know. Perhaps we could be advised of those practical rules. I am suggesting that, to be on the safe side, company rules and the Bill should state that there should be zero measures of alcohol. I do not know what the effect of that would be in terms of social gatherings before going on duty. I am not sure whether it would constitute an undue prejudice on the social and private life of a person involved in transport, but it is part of our duty as legislators to investigate that.<br><br>
It may take two or three goes to determine what the optimum should be as the Bill passes through both Houses. I think that I had better leave it at that.<br><br>
I have tried to open up the subject, dealing with the many dimensions that have come to mind; my hon. Friends and Conservative Members may wish to raise others. I do not suggest that I would adhere to that limit with enormous affirmation through thick and thin—it is suggested more by way of exploration. However, I maintain that if there is to be a limit, it would be best set at zero. It would provide confidence, certainty and simplicity to whatever legislation may ensue.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate <span class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 92, 93 and 94 were tabled in my name. I shall approach the subject in the same spirit as the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). He was right that it is an exploratory approach to a difficult subject. If we seek sensible rules, the immediate logic would be to adopt the Government's proposal to introduce new limits similar to those in the Road Traffic Acts. On the face of it, that is logical, equitable and I presume acceptable to the majority of people in the industry although I have not received any correspondence. We are entitled to explore whether it goes far enough, but it would be foolish to approach the subject dogmatically. It is an important matter of public policy; I do not believe that it can be resolved by this relatively small Committee. If the principle was to be challenged, the Floor of the House would be a better place to consider it. None the less, this is the right place to explore the matter in detail.<br><br>
We have before us several proposals. First, is what is proposed in the Bill—that the limit should be 80 mg—comparable to the limit applied to drivers under the Road Traffic Acts. At the other end of the scale is the proposition of the hon. Member for Newham, South for a zero limit. Between those is a proposal made by the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn), who is not with us this afternoon, for a limit of 20 mg. Lastly is the limit given in the amendments that I tabled which was made at the instigation of the British Railways Board, of 40 mg. The proposed limits are 80 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg and zero.<br><br>
It is worth our while examining the proposals today, because whatever we decide, we shall return to the subject in future. It is logical to suggest that if we apply such limits to the railways, we should consider whether other public transport, such as public service vehicles, airlines and so on, should be similarly limited. Although we are debating the criminal law, we must remember that those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
organisations have different internal disciplinary codes of conduct; it should not be thought that high limits under the criminal code would mean that public service vehicle drivers should be able to drink happily up to those limits. That is not the case.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the different points. I am sure that none of us will mistake brevity for a lack of awareness that the subject is important to all in the industry and to the general public. The hon. Member for Newham, South suggested a zero limit. Most of us will have received representations from the British Medical Association and I believe that we have all had a letter from the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety—PACTS. It is worth commenting on what they say with regard to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of zero.<br><br>
The BMA says that it
<br><blockquote><p>"would like to see the level reduced to zero as a clear and unequivocal statement that train drivers should not drink and drive. Lowering the limit to 20mg/100ml should be a step towards a zero limit."</p></blockquote>
PACTS makes the sensible point that 20 mg, which is the proposition of the hon. Member for Southport, is generally considered to be the lowest practicable limit as it makes allowance for small amounts of alcohol in some foodstuffs and medicines and for margins of instrumentation error. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would mean that people could easily be over the limit from drinking very small amounts of alcohol and would support the current no drinking and driving message."</p></blockquote>
That seems a powerful argument against the zero figure proposed by the hon. Member for Newham, South. In other words, the difference between 20 and zero is one that is almost technical; certainly, both are extremely low limits.<br><br>
British Rail states that it welcomes the principle of the proposed change in the law, but it is concerned that the requirements of safety on railways will not fully be met unless lower limits are prescribed for railway staff. I have a copy of an article from the <i>British Medical Journal</i> which supports that view. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A train driver's ability to drive is significantly impaired if he has consumed alcohol even where the concentration of alcohol in his blood is less than the Road Traffic Act limits."</p></blockquote>
One point which is made continually bears examination, although it is a difficult argument. It is that the consequences of accidents caused by train drivers whose ability is impaired by alcohol can be far worse than those caused by drivers of motor vehicles. That is an important point because it is the essence of the case for lower limits for train drivers than for car drivers.<br><br>
I imagine that there will be strong arguments against that view because the horrendous results of an accident caused by a drunken driver on the road can be as dramatic as those caused by a train driver. Of course, it is self-evident that a train driver is responsible for thousands of passengers, but there is equal responsibility on all drivers of all vehicles. That is the nub of the case made by the <i>British Medical Journal</i> and British Rail.<br><br>
My amendments would halve the blood alcohol limits. They recognise that the consequences of accidents caused by railway staff are potentially even greater than those caused by drivers of motor vehicles. Therefore, railway staff should be under a particularly stringent responsibility not to drink while at work or shortly before coming on duty. That is a simple proposition, but I well understand
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
that it requires a great deal of detailed examination. I believe that Parliament will return to the matter time and again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman have the answer to questions asked by two of my hon. Friends about the time limits within British Rail's current rules for either drivers or others? We should make a difference of category in that respect. Perhaps we can return to the matter later in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I do not have that answer. I wish that I had it because the relevant internal rules of conduct are important in the context of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To help the debate, the Department's medical advice is that civil aviation people should not drink for eight hours before reporting to work to avoid any alcohol in their bodies. British Rail is considering what advice to give. I hope that that answers the question and helps my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is most helpful and it re-emphasises that we are not talking about standard practice or the rules for drivers. One assumes that if there are disciplinary rules or rules of employment, they will broadly be accepted by both sides of the industry. They could be imposed against the will of the employees, but it is most likely that they would gain general acceptance and approval. We are talking about the application of the criminal law to those circumstances. We have a choice: we can assume that the consequences of a railway accident are so much greater that Parliament should impose tighter rules, or that rules should be the same for all drivers of all vehicles, in which case we would accept the proposition used by my hon. Friend the Minister.<br><br>
As I have said, we would be foolish to be dogmatic. We could set an example in Committee and could take steps to enforce the rule. However, we should hear the views of my hon. Friend the Minister and, indeed, the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) for whose knowledge and experience of railways—not of drinking—I have considerable respect. Those are my arguments, but we should listen carefully to what other hon. Members have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). I think that the Government's position is illogical. On Second Reading, the Minister more or less said that people should not drive trains or other public service vehicles if they have had a drink. However, he also seemed to say that it would be difficult to maintain fairness in court if there were an accident between the driver of a private car who is just below the legal limit and the driver of one of the trams that will run through our cities who has a considerably lower amount of alcohol but who is above a zero limit. That is not a good comparison, because there is a clear distinction between drivers of private vehicles and drivers of public vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a fairly lengthy speech later. I might have used the analogy to which the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) referred, but a better analogy is one in which a collision occurs between a guided vehicle and a bus and different limits apply to the drivers. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would wish to address that analogy.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0751">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with public and private vehicles. In the majority of cases, car passengers can take cognisance of how capable drivers are of driving. Although it can be socially embarrassing, steps can be taken to persuade drivers to drive sensibly if passengers do not approve of their driving. If passengers know that a driver has been drinking, they can refuse a lift.<br><br>
However, when passengers board trams or trains they are unlikely to be able to see the driver. On one-man-operated buses, there is a good chance that passengers will, at least, speak to drivers before they board. Alternatively, bus passengers can jump off after a couple of stops—although that might not be very nice, because for the next bus might not come along for another week—if they suspect drivers. Passengers on trams or trains place themselves in the hands of drivers rather more than if they travelled by private car or, to a certain extent, bus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is attributing to the Minister an analogy that I used on Second Reading—the Manchester Metro. My hon. Friend is not addressing the point to which the Minister has referred. The Minister used the example of a collision between a bus and a metro train in which, if the amendment were accepted, the bus driver who is below 80mg walks free, while the train driver who is above 40mg is arrested. That would be anomalous, which was the point the Minister was making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I still argue that, on the whole, passengers can make judgments. The London docklands overhead railway does not run very often, but when it does it runs without a driver. It is controlled by a person who is some distance away, so passengers are unable to judge whether he is competent.<br><br>
There is a difference between the tram or the train and the private car.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Lord <span class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the argument of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) closely, but what he has said might apply equally to signalmen. At the risk of introducing a humorous note into this serious debate, one can envisage the day when the captain of an aeroplane might announce details of the destination, the external temperature, the altitude of the plane, and the level of alcohol in his bloodstream.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that aeroplane pilots are under a duty not to consume alcohol for eight hours before take-off. That is very sensible.<br><br>
We are talking about guards and other responsible persons. I have emphasised the condition of the driver, but anyone who is interested in the safety of public transport should consider the zero limit. I accept that the Government have a problem, especially with the anomaly that arises in connection with buses, but that problem might be solved by introducing a zero limit for a bus driver. The necessary legislation could specify that any driver of passengers for payment should observe that zero limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be simple to set out for any public service vehicle or heavy goods vehicle licence holder a different code of minimum requirements to be observed in performance of his or her duties? That would eliminate the anomaly regarding trams and buses.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn too wide of the subject. My point was simply that I was not convinced by the Minister's contention on Second Reading that there was overriding logic behind the proposal to set the limit at levels that currently obtain for car drivers. I believe that that limit is unsatisfactory and should be lowered.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) argued persuasively that the level should be reduced by half. My difficulty with that argument stems from my experience as a car driver. When I go to a place that serves alcohol and choose a soft drink because I am driving, I am inundated with advice from other people that I can drink this, that and the other and still remain below the limit.<br><br>
Some of that advice is good, but most of it is extremely dodgy. I am also aware that each individual reacts differently to the amount of alcohol consumed and that the speed at which its effects can be felt varies from person to person. Some cynics maintain that a person who practises often enough has greater tolerance than someone who does not. However, that is the difficulty. Even if the limit is set at 20 mg—a very small amount of alcohol—there will still be many stories about how it is perfectly all right according to the law to drink a certain amount. The inevitable result is that some people will consume more than that amount. That is the difficulty with any limit other than zero.<br><br>
However, I recognise that there is a difficulty even with the zero limit. Alcohol lingers in the bloodstream. As the Minister said, the civil aviation recommendation is that no alcohol should be consumed by a pilot in the eight hours before a flight. But it is possible to consume food or beverages without knowing that they contain alcohol, only to find later that small traces of alcohol are present in the bloodstream. Therefore, I would set the limt at zero, but allow people to claim in defence that they registered less than 20 mg or 15 mg, provided that they could demonstrate that they had had nothing to drink in the previous four or five hours. If we want to make transport systems safe for the public, we must insist that people cannot work and drink.<br><br>
In the past, some people have drunk at work and, sadly, on occasions, it has resulted in fatalities—sometimes, of the workmen themselves. We must protect the public and, sometimes, protect people from themselves. I urge the Government to set a much lower limit. The only logical limit, which is easy to enforce, is the zero limit, although I would permit the legal defence that a person did not wittingly have alcohol in his or her bloodstream.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important subject. We have already heard three thoughtful speeches. We are aware of our limitations as a Committee and as a legislative body arbitrarily to set alcohol limits. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) spoke of the need to lower the drinking limit for motorists. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, it would be anomalous to set different limits for the reasons that I outlined on Second Reading and in Committee.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Members who suggested that the ideal limit for people who drive trains, operate signalling centres or carry out maintenance work and other functions covered by the Bill is zero. But advocating and legislating are two different things. As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned, enforcing that zero limit would be fraught with difficulty. I understand the logic behind his suggestion of a zero limit and a defence
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
that alcohol was unwittingly consumed. But it would certainly cause the legal profession some joy if we were to enshrine that principle in statute. We have already seen how solicitors and barristers, who have been clever enough to spot loopholes in drink-driving legislation—some real, some imaginary, but all impressive to magistrates—have had their clients cases dismissed yet newspaper reports of the evidence seemed to show that their clients were palpably guilty.<br><br>
We must keep alcohol and the railway industry in perspective. In the past 20 years, there have been three accidents where the subsequent inquiry revealed overindulgence in drink as factors in two of them and drugs in the other. The driver in the Cannon street accident of 1990 was found to have the product of some illegal substance in his blood two days later. There was an accident at Morpeth in 1984. The driver had consumed some alcohol and took a curve restricted to 40 mph at a much faster speed and drove the train and the first few coaches down an embankment and up to the front door of someone's bungalow. A more serious accident occurred about 20 years ago at Eltham Well hall. The driver's conduct was disgraceful: he had driven people on an excursion to the seaside and spend the day drinking. He wrecked his train and killed himself and several passengers. Some incidents are so unusual that they merit comment. The railway industry is operated mostly by people who know the dangers of excess alcohol consumption and are aware of its consequences for themselves and the people for whom they are responsible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) said that he did not know the unions' view on such matters. I took the trouble to find out. I hope that Conservative Members will not claim that that is typical of the Labour party, which is in the thrall of the trades unions. I believed that those responsible for driving trains and their representatives would be interested.<br><br>
The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, which is not my union, forwarded me a copy of a letter that was sent to Mr. S. K. Reeves of railway division A in the Department of Transport. The letter is headed:
<br><blockquote><p>"Consultation on Proposed Drink and Drugs Legislation: Railways and Other Systems of Guided Transport".</p></blockquote>
It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thank you for your letter of 23 September 1991 inviting my Society's comments on the enclosed legislative proposals relating to drink and drug abuse on railways and other forms of guided transport.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We are totally committed to safety on the railway and support the drugs and alcohol policies held by the three organisations where ASLEF's members are employed: British Rail, London Underground Limited, and Tyne and Wear Metro. We recognise that the proposed introduction of this legislation will work in conjunction with these policies and we welcome it accordingly."</p></blockquote>
The letter suggests other groups of employees that could be covered by the proposed legislation. Some of those suggestions, such as including management, and maintenance and repair staff in the provisions, are incorporated in the Bill. All the grades mentioned in the letter are covered by the Bill. The unions are anxious that any problem is properly tackled and that the provisions for working practices are enshrined in law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the traditions of the railway and the tragic accidents that have occurred. There was a strong railway tradition of dismissing employees who drank. That tradition is good.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
However, we are now considering a series of new metros and tramways. It is important that they establish the same vigorous tradition as the railways. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East should recognise that we wish the new transport systems to establish a strong tradition of no alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.<br><br>
The Opposition welcome some of the new forms of transport in many towns and cities. We wish that Ministers could have persuaded the Treasury to have coughed up the cash for them sooner. Transferring the traditions within the railway industry to those new transport system will not be difficult. The ethos and principles of railway operation and the motivation of many thousands of men and women who work in the railway industry can be transferred to those who work on the newer forms of guided transport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) and for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) introduced a matter that we have not discussed—a discrepancy between criminal law and the rule book or the terms of employment of an undertaking. Everybody believes that, where possible they should be in line. In British Rail they would effectively be in line if we adopted a zero limit for those responsible for rail transport. Is it not possible that different undertakings could adopt for their rule book different reflections of what is in the criminal law?<br><br>
It would be a pity if different undertakings that had similar functions adopted different laws in their rule books, especially as there may be a proliferation of different undertakings in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Bill is designed to avoid such a situation. What we are enshrining in law will apply equally to all modes of transport covered by the Bill. If the amendment were accepted and the existing 80 mg limit were affected, the proposed limit would apply uniformly to the range of industries covered by the Bill.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I return to the vexed questions of enforcement and whether a zero limit is acceptable. I remind my hon. Friends that not only drivers and train crews but maintenance staff and signalmen are covered by the Bill.<br><br>
I said to your co-Chairman this morning, Mr. Lamond, that I would avoid railway reminiscences. There is nothing worse than Members of Parliament who tell stories about life before they were elected to this place. Most of our constituents do not believe that we had any life before we came here. However, I hope that I might be forgiven for transgresing just once more.<br><br>
During my undistinguished railway career, I was a signalman and a guard and my last job, in 1973–74, was in the train crew control office at Preston. I think that, given the nature of those three jobs, I have fallen out with more engine drivers than any other member of the Committee. I have probably fallen out with more engine drivers than Derek Fullick, the ASLEF general secretary.<br><br>
By the nature of the railway industry, much of the track maintenance work is done on Saturday nights and Sundays, as we all know when we travel by train on Sundays. It has been customary for many years for the track maintenance gang—the plate layers, as they are still known, whatever their official title is—to meet in the pub nearest the site before heading to the site, usually after the passage of the last train on that track. Those of my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0753">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
Friends who do not imbibe alcohol and regard it as a demon to be exorcised from society—I know that some of them north of the border feel strongly on this issue—might regard that practice as reprehensible. But it is perfectly understandable: trying to get people to spend eight or 12 hours in the open air replacing or repairing track on a Saturday night is already difficult enough. If we tell them that, in addition, they must not have a drink for eight hours before coming to work, I think that standards of track maintenance will fall even lower than they have, thanks to the Government's budget cuts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is another anomaly regarding railway workers. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) is not the only Opposition Member who has worked for British Rail. I was a railway clerk—a job which might not have the same standing among guards as some others.<br><br>
A railway clerk travelling to work in a car could be subject to a less strict limit than a guard. It is unacceptable that railway staff working together for the same company, whether they drink together or not, should be subject to different limits. I take my hon. Friend's point that the way to tackle the problem is to reduce the limits for car drivers and apply that principle to railway workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend points out another anomaly that I had not thought of: the proposal applies only to certain specified railway grades, who may be working with people whose grades are not specified in the Bill. There would thus be two separate limits for blood and breath alcohol content. That is invidious and undesirable. I hope that the Committee will bear that in mind when it has listened to the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The driver of a car is frequently under the legal limit and perfectly safe but his passenger is not. That is the analogy with people working on a railway. Some people have other people's lives in their hands directly as a result of the quality of their work—maintenance, for example—or the task that they perform, but others do not. When a car passenger has had a lot to drink the driver may resent it—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend, but it is difficult to listen to interventions and to reply to them when Conservative Members are holding private conversations, especially when one of those Members is the Whip. Whips are supposed to belt up—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) did so, he would please us verbally as well as aesthetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should leave maintaining order in the Committee to me and continue with his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall do so, Mr. Lamond.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's analogy is wrong: there is a big difference between a passenger in a car who has been imbibing alcohol and someone who is on duty at work. I return to the remark made by the hon. Member for Faversham, and remind the Committee that British Rail has internal rules about people of any grade working if they have rendered themselves unfit to do so because of their consumption of alcohol. Those responsible for signing railway workers on and off duty are conscious that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
some times of day are more sensitive. At 10 pm on a Saturday night, it is necessary to keep an eye open to ensure that no one tries to book on duty, for whatever job, if he or she has consumed excessive alcohol.<br><br>
One group not covered who may work alongside men and women whose grades are included is railmen on a station. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish may say that they have no responsibility for passenger safety. I remind him that more than one accident has been caused by a sober railman taking a luggage truck from one track to another across running lines and being struck by a passing train, thereby causing a derailment. Anyone taking a job on the railways is made aware that there is danger from the trains and that it is the employee's responsibility to avoid danger and to avoid putting passengers or railway equipment at risk. There is an anomaly and it is not desirable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) said.<br><br>
In aviation the zero limit, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South, called it, is expressed in the phrase "eight hours bottle to throttle". That could be translated as "eight hours ale to rail" in this case. I remind my hon. Friends that the monthly working hours for aircrew are very strictly regulated. The contrast with the working hours in the railway industry is marked—as the accident at Clapham junction and the Hidden report showed. Long hours in responsible jobs in the railway industry are common throughout the country, but especially in the south of England. Insistence on a zero limit, apart from the problems of enforcement, would exacerbate the problems of recruitment and retention of railway staff.<br><br>
As for the reduction of alcohol limits for the industries and grades covered by the legislation, we have all become aware of just how anomalous that is. In reducing the limits to those that apply to car drivers, the Government have got it right, although I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South that those limits are themselves wrong. They must all come down together. We must avoid the anomalous situation that the amendment could create of a person walking away from an accident without any question of legal action being taken against him, yet a person with a lower limit being arrested. That would not be fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful and important debate. I should like first to comment on one of the points made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). He said, and I hope that my paraphrase of his remarks does not misrepresent him too much, that the Opposition accept that good standards apply to the railways, but their real worry is the proliferation of light railway systems which might introduce bad practice. Metro systems have generally adopted working rules similar to those of British Rail. The railway inspectors have, or will have, oversight of all the systems' operating practices. I hope that that important point goes some way to reassure the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make it very clear in my intervention, but I understand that a substantial number of people have been dismissed from British Rail for having taken alcohol before coming on duty. There is no ambiguity. British Rail's attitude is that a person is in disciplinary trouble if he has done that. The difficulty with some of these new set-ups is that the rules
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0754">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
are there, but until the first person is dismissed it is not certain that they will be enforced with vigour. There is not that tradition of case law. That was my only point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One can overcome that problem, too. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but I do not think there is a need to worry.<br><br>
The alcohol limits in clause 39 deal with the level of alcohol which justifies criminal sanctions rather than operators' own disciplinary proceedings. The first line of defence for public safety consists of the preventive measures and the strict disciplinary code enforced by operators. It is a rule on BR that no one should report for duty under the influence of, nor take while on duty, alcohol or any other substance which might impair their safety, efficiency or vigilance. Similar provisions apply to London Underground staff. BR's code of practice views contravention of that rule very seriously and regards dismissal as the normal result. That is a powerful deterrent. It would be mirrored on any other metro system.<br><br>
Amendment No. 139 would have the effect of substituting a zero alcohol limit. The human body manufactures alcohol. Many medicines and food additives contain alcohol. A zero limit is, therefore, totally impractical. It could have the effect of making it a criminal offence to take certain cough sweets. Apart from the medical arguments, there are also practical problems with measuring alcohol levels at low proportions.<br><br>
I do, however, accept the proposition that the best rule is for no one to work on a transport system when under the influence of drink. A zero limit is already reflected in operators' rule books, but it cannot provide the basis for a criminal offence. We must draw a distinction between the contractual relations between employee and employer and a person's rather different responsibility to society.<br><br>
We were therefore faced with the task of choosing alcohol limits for railways for the first time. I accept the point that the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) made about this being a criminal offence for the first time. We consider the options carefully before proposing the same limits as those contained in the Road Traffic Act 1988. It is important to note that both those limits can be changed later by an affirmative order, so separate legislation will not be necessary if advice is so convincing that the Government of the day decide to change the limits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would such an affirmative order cover the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Bill?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the answer is that it would not and that two affirmative orders would be required, but that would not be unduly difficult as it could be done on the same day. However, that is a matter for the draftsmen.<br><br>
The differing limits proposed in the amendments that we have debated show that seeking to adopt a lower limit would be an arbitrary decision on which there is no consensus. That is not surprising. Medical science doeds not provide clear-cut guidance at present. The matter also raises important, wider issues about criminal sanctions.<br><br>
I am not persuaded at present that a lower alcohol limit would be effective in reducing the comparatively rare cases of alcohol abuse on railways and tramways. The key to minimising the risk lies with effective action by operators. In fact, a lower alcohol limit could even be dangerous by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
encouraging staff to believe that it was safe to drink up to a lower limit. We must not risk undermining operators' rules in that way.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish said that many people are encouraged to have a drink because it will not put them over the limit. I have a pamphlet that shows the levels at which alcohol becomes more dangerous to the body. There is a substantial difference in the impairment of driving ability between those who are most, and those who are least, susceptible to alcohol. The limit prescribed in clause 39 matches the level of abuse above which it is a criminal offence under road traffic law to drive. It is the point at which railway safety staff have in their bodies so much alcohol that they are committing a criminal offence. That is not at all the same as saying that a person's judgment is impaired only when he reaches that level. The limit should therefore be fixed with an eye to blameworthiness rather than medical condition.<br><br>
In any event, all individuals are different. Road traffic studies show that inexperienced drivers and infrequent drinkers have a marked increase in risk at lower alcohol levels, while older and heavier drinkers have a diminished risk. The limits must be high enough to ensure that criminal sanctions are justified. If lower limits were set, it would be essential to look again at the right criminal sanctions. There would otherwise be a wide spectrum of behaviour caught by the same sanctions.<br><br>
There is no conclusive medical evidence about what the criminal levels should be. The 80 mg road traffic limit is tried and tested and has been shown scientifically to be the take-off point for drinking and driving accidents. Some may argue that there is a distinction between impairment to drive a motor vehicle against impairment to undertake the wide variety of functions engaged in railway safety, but driving is an acquired skill and, in that respect, is similar to the occupational skills of railway safety staff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many car drivers know what their limits are and how they relate to current legislation. Some car drivers are also railway workers. The limits that apply to them as motorists may influence their behaviour when they are about to come to work. That has advantages as well as disadvantages: some may stop at a certain stage while others may push themselves to the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman's argument, I note what he said. It would be useful for railway workers to have a guide, but the operators' code of employment states that a driver should not turn up for work under the influence of alcohol. We are discussing criminality, but I accept the hon. Gentleman's valid point about people's natural behaviour. I have not seen sufficient evidence that the differences in skills required for road traffic and guided transport justify different limits. In both cases the best rule is for no one to be under the influence.<br><br>
I do not accept the argument that the prescribed alcohol level should depend on the number of people at risk. It is simply not possible, on road or rail, to predict the consequences of every irresponsible or criminal action. We all tend to think of the provisions in relation to the driver of an express train. But the drink and drug provisions will catch far more railway staff. The casualties that the offender knew he was likely to cause would be a matter for the courts to take into account in sentencing, rather than a justification for different alcohol limits in different modes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0755">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
of transport. They also underline the need for operators to exercise maximum and continuous vigilance in enforcement of their own rules.<br><br>
Consistency with road traffic provisions is also desirable because of those situations where tramways operate in a road. It would not make sense to treat the drivers of trams and buses differently. Nor would it be sensible for a tram driver to be subject to different prescribed limits depending on whether he was driving in a public place such as a road, or on private land such as a trackbed formerly belonging to British Rail.<br><br>
Foreign experience is varied. Nine European Community members have a 80 mg blood alcohol limit for road safety, and three members have a limit of 50 mg. Most states in the United States adopt a level of 100 mg for road traffic, while some Scandinavian countries have lower limits. As regards railways, of the six countries that the Department has contacted, France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands do not have statutory alcohol limits. Sweden has a statutory offence, with the level of penalty depending on whether the offender's breath alcohol content exceeded 10 microgrammes or 75 microgrammes compared with 35 microgrammes in the Bill. The United States has compulsory alcohol testing of certain railway employees after accidents and on suspicion. So our proposals are ahead of many countries in introducing a comprehensive statutory framework. It is entirely reasonable for the Bill to adopt 80 mg as the average level of which accident risk significantly takes off.<br><br>
In considering the issue of alcohol limits, the Committee will wish to bear in mind the fact that it will be an offence under clause 28(1) for someone to work when he is "unfit" through drink, even if he is below the alcohol limit for the separate offence in subsection (2). That reinforces the message that the prescribed alcohol limits do not imply that it is safe to drink up to these limits.<br><br>
Amendment No. 106 is a consequence of amendment No. 107. It aims to maintain the safeguard for suspects who are marginally over the prescribed limit on the evidence of breath analysis, in the light of the fourfold reduction in alcohol limits proposed in amendment No. 107. Since we do not accept the principle of lower alcohol limits at present, it follows that I cannot accept the amendment.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will accept the case for consistency with the criminal sanctions in the Road Traffic Act. As with that Act, the prescribed alcohol limit may be amended by regulations subject to affirmative resolution. We have no current plans to amend the limit, but we will keep it under review.<br><br>
This has been a useful debate on an important part of the Bill, which is the result of responses and letters sent by the coroner following the Cannon Street accident to which the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) referred. I am glad that we have been able to include this section in the Bill. I realise that the subject is important. The alcohol limit can be changed by affirmative resolution, so a future Government who receive new medical evidence will be able to change it relatively simply without the need for fresh legislation.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It falls to me to sum up this interesting discussion. I shall try to do so and hope that my remarks will help any future debates on the subject, as there are bound to be some.<br><br>
We have all tried to identify the distinctive features that should go into statute, bearing in mind a knowledge of human nature and the knowledge that some rule books that are not directly statutory will not define criminal conduct. They will be the ethos of the trade.<br><br>
We must find a structure—I am not convinced that the Government have found it yet—in which anomalies are minimised and those that remain are acceptable and do not obtrude into the public consciousness as unacceptable. We must seek the minimum anomalies in a practical scheme that the public find acceptable. We should consider the consequences of two effective limits. One is the criminal limit, which I accept must be in statute, and the other must be included by undertakers. The undertakers' rules will be bound to be much more stringent than those that appear in statute. I think that I am right to say that there are no statutory limits for those engaged in railways and tramways. The need for them is illustrated by the statutory limits that apply for individual car drivers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to the fact that drunkenness by staff or others on railway premises is covered by the Railway Regulation Act 1842. In those less sophisticated days, if people fell down they were considered to be drunk and if they stood up they were not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend because that introduces the next point that might be helpful. Even if companies' rule books do not appear in statute, they must be part of the structure. I wonder whether there is an obligation on the operator to issue rules on the matter in the general statute on the operation of transport systems. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East suggested, an obvious rule of employment is that one does not arrive at work unfit for duty, through drink, drugs, or other voluntarily administered liquid or solid. That is reasonable and acceptable.<br><br>
However, I wonder whether a statutory framework exists which puts an obligation on undertakers and whether there is a general consensus or some advice on the commonality of that framework. In future, we shall have many more tramways—I do not know what happened in the early years of the century when municipal and private tramways operated all over the place.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish illustrated to some extent the psychological problem. The criminal limit is the limit at which someone is criminally culpable. The company limit could be less than that and I imagine that the limit for railway drivers and airline pilots is zero or as near zero as practically obtainable. People will then be inclined to say, "Well, if it is all right for me to drive my car up to a certain limit, why cannot I be on duty as well?" We must guard against such a reaction. If we have a two-tier system, we must deal with that matter.<br><br>
One way of dealing with the matter would be for one limit to reinforce, rather than undermine, the other. We must consider whether—my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East gave a graphic illustration of this—the category of duty is perhaps a little too wide. The word "maintenance" has a wide range of meaning. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East mentioned track maintenance, which is perhaps one of the most physically exacting tasks. The workers have a social
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0756">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
camaraderie of their own. However, other than for the look-out or the man in charge, the work has different requirements from those of the more critical tasks. The hon. Member for Suffolk, Central (Mr. Lord) mentioned the man who supplies the electricity. The man pressing the buttons that supply the electricity on the London docklands railway is in a much more critical position than someone who is in charge of a substation where, if something goes wrong, he simply stops the train. Nowadays, a signalman at a central signalling centre also has crucial functions—particularly that of looking at screens to see that level crossings that may be 50 or 60 miles away are clear before pressing buttons to let through trains. That is a vital distinction. We may need to re-examine the categories.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
We appear to have got to the stage where we are seeking a criminal limit that is understandable and applicable. I am not sure whether the criminal limit should be equivalent to the limit for the private car user. I accept what the Minister said about a limit of zero. The medical evidence on that should be considered. The situation in Sweden should be examined. From that point of view, my amendment is perhaps not as well drafted as it might be. However, I maintain that it would not be conducive to the confidence of the public if it felt that the criminal law were not sufficiently practical to encourage or enable—at least to be perceived as doing so, since there is a difference between perception and reality drivers of all public service vehicles, railway signalmen or platform workers, as distinct from booking office workers, to carry out their duties with limits that were slightly lower than those for car users.<br><br>
We should re-examine the issue and devise an acceptable, near-zero or very low limit in terms of criminal responsibility. That limit should match that of the national consensus about what the actual rule should be. The limits should be compatible, although not necessarily identical. That would create maximum acceptability among the operators and a distinction between those different functions as well as giving the public confidence that the limits are correct and those for which Parliament should legislate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most members of the Committee have probably received a letter from the director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, Derek Rutherford, whom I knew many years ago and who is very anti-drink. That letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A definitive review of two hundred scientific studies concluded that there is no absolute threshold in relation to alcohol impairment and that there is clear evidence of impairment of skills and performance at concentrations between ten and forty mg%."</p></blockquote>
That, in addition to the documents provided with the letter, show that there is some general acceptance for a limit of 10 mg, as in the Swedish legislation. The Minister said that a limit of zero would be inappropriate because alcohol can be picked up from other sources. A limit of 10 mg might, therefore, be acceptable, although there are many other arguments about whether that should generally be accepted as the lower level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Perhaps the rule book should suggest something towards zero or zero itself. In criminal matters relating to statute, the figure for certain grades should, perhaps, be that mentioned by my hon. Friend. A distinction should be considered. I hope that this has been a useful debate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lord</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to this long debate. To be slightly humorous for a moment, I must say that it reminds me of a nursery rhyme from my childhood:
<br><blockquote><p>"… That kissed the maiden all forlorn,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That tossed the dog,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That worried the cat,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That killed the rat,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That ate the corn,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That lay in the house that Jack built."</p></blockquote>
The matters are all inter-related and the more one listens to the debate, the more one realises that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East mentioned the permanent way. I shall not reminisce about my days with British Rail. They merely relate to trees near the track rather than the track itself. However, the duties of a lookout man are most important, as are those of the ordinary worker on the platforms who must ensure that the doors are properly shut, for example. There have been many instances of people falling from railway carriages.<br><br>
To some extent, perhaps we seek arbitrary national limits to remove responsibility from the relevant organisations. The point made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish may be valid. Perhaps the onus should be on the organisation providing the public transport to set the toughest possible rules and regulations for its employees, and perhaps it should be responsible. Otherwise, if we are not careful we may set arbitrary limits. That may be an excuse for shunting responsibility away from the managers of the organisations and on to the legal system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; I think that we are making progress. In the first part of my closing remarks, I inquired whether there was a national framework of obligation on operators and undertakers. I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman. I suggested that the Bill probably goes into too much detail in specifying certain grades. In the end, only the operator can specify.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be rather unfair to take as read the inference in the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Central (Mr. Lord). Surely all the evidence shows that the operators—principally British Rail—are far ahead of the law and have applied a much tougher regime than that required by law. They have applied that in the rules and have upheld it in practice. It would be wrong to suggest that they now hope that the law will do their job for them. In fact, it is reasonable for operators to want the law to reinforce more strongly their disciplinary codes. Incidentally—and I say this just in case my hon. Friend has misunderstood—the Bill clearly specifies signal men, lookout men, those engaged in maintenance, and so on. Therefore, I am not sure that my hon. Friend's argument was that strong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would go even further. We have a clear choice between requiring any undertaker or operator to have an effective and efficient system of rules in which the public can be confident—where grades may be changed—and a system of statute relating to criminal law. There is a big distinction between the two, and we take too far the definition of function. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East said, maintenance can mean all things.<br><br>
I shall conclude on a serious and important note. There would be a difference between the chap shovelling ballast at Clapham Junction late on a Sunday afternoon and the man with a pair of pliers clipping the ends of wires. We

must remember that, at all times, safety on the railway is important. If we go into too much detail in statute, difficulties could arise.</span></p>

OFFENCES BY OPERATORS OF TRANSPORT SYSTEMS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 165, in page 15, line 21, leave out

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 166, in page 15, line 29, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'exercised all due diligence'</p></blockquote>
and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'done everything that was reasonably practicable'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue is of immense significance, as the Committee will appreciate. It concerns preference for a particular phrase. Do we prefer "exercised all due diligence" or the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"done everything that was reasonably practicable"?</p></blockquote>
That is a classical debate for lawyers. I do not claim such eminent distinction and shall therefore put the case briefly to the Committee and hope that the Minister will accept my argument.<br><br>
The amendments are proposed on behalf of the British Railways Board and London Underground. The operator has a defence under clause 29(3) if he has "exercised all due diligence" to prevent the commission on the transport system of any offence under clause 28. The amendments would alter the defence available to the operator of the transport system or the employer. Instead of having to show that he "exercised all due diligence", he would have to show that he had
<br><blockquote><p>"done everything that was reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
to avoid the commission of the offence. The defence of "exercising all due diligence" is to be found in earlier legislation such as the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 and the Trade Descriptions Act 1968.<br><br>
Although there are a number of reported court cases on what is meant by this defence, no consistent meaning has been given. The interpretation is generally left to the magistrates or other courts considering the case. It has sometimes been held that "due diligence" amounts to the same thing as doing
<br><blockquote><p>"everything that was reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
but in other cases a lower or higher standard has been imported. On the other hand, the expression to do
<br><blockquote><p>"everything that was reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
which appears in the more recent Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 has a meaning that is well understood. The transport operator or employer would be required to set up a reasonable system to prevent offences being committed under clause 28. The test of a reasonable system would be one where the risk of commission of offences was properly balanced against the cost of establishing the system.<br><br>
I emphasise that the British Rail Board and London Underground are in no way seeking to lower the standard of care which they would be required to exercise, but it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
considered that the proposed amendment would clarify what their duty would be under the new legislation. That would be in the interests of all concerned in the implementation of part II of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have considered carefully whether the defence for the two offences in clause 29 should be
<br><blockquote><p>"done everything that was reasonably practicable",</p></blockquote>
rather than "exercised all due diligence" to prevent the commission of the original drink and drug offence. London Transport also suggested such a change, but we are not persuaded that it is necessary to amend the Bill in that way. Both tests are well precedented in safety legislation and have been interpreted in similar ways by the courts. "Due diligence" involves taking all reasonable steps to prevent something happening.<br><br>
"All due diligence" is the test applied in drink and drug offences under air navigation orders, and seems to have caused few problems for airlines. The same test is imposed by the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 for several safety offences relating to buses and coaches. Having different tests for various safety offences by tram and bus operators could be regarded as inconsistent.<br><br>
In my view, "all due diligence" captures very well the effort operators should devote to preventing drink and drug offences on transport systems if they are to avoid prosecution. I am not convinced that there is a compelling reason to change this well-practised and well-precedented defence.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister of State wrote to London Underground expressing our view, so the matter has been discussed. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right to say that there is a string of precedents for the use of the phrase "due diligence". On the other hand, there are precedents for the use of the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"everything that was reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
I am glad to hear from my hon. Friend that the issue has been thoroughly considered, so I will not press the matter further. However, it is odd to have different phrases in different legislation. It would be more logical to use the same phrase throughout so that there could be no difference in interpretation and the matter could not be misunderstood. Perhaps a greater hand than mine will apply itself and introduce standard phraseology throughout health and safety legislation. That might deprive a few lawyers of work and fees, but that would not worry many of us.<br><br>
I am sorry that I cannot succeed on this occasion, but I am glad that the matter has been discussed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

BREATH TESTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The clause covers breath tests and I wish to question the Minister on a couple of points that were raised on Second Reading.<br><br>
I considered several amendments to the clause, but however I drafted them they seemed to do the opposite of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0758">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
what I intended. In the context of the previous amendment, that shows that when parliamentary draftsmen vary the phraseology in a Bill, they do so with consummate skill. That not only provides work for lawyers, but baffles politicians. There may be good objectives in the drafting, but the notes on clauses refer to the powers of enforcement being used primarily by the British Transport police. That is only part of the story. The ordinary police—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Constable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, any police constable. The British Transport police usually have some knowledge of railway working practices and regulations and non-railway police officers do not. Incidents occurred in which railway workers were given instructions that conflicted with the regulations for the safe working of the railway industry and sometimes caused delay due to trains being stopped unnecessarily on the instructions of the constables.<br><br>
If railway employees are to be breathalysed, we should define more thoroughly than in clause 30 how that may be done. For example, no time limit is laid down for a specific incident. The clause provides for railway workers to be breathalysed at home if there are grounds for suspecting that an incident on railway premises was alcohol-related. I should have thought that two police officers would be required—the British Transport police officer who was involved in the original incident on railway premises, and a regular police officer. Will a British Transport police officer be authorised under the Bill to breathalyse a railway employee at home, or would a regular police officer have to be brought in to carry out the breath test? There may be a problem with time. Many car drivers who have been breathalysed at home have claimed that they were so shaken up by the incident that they had eight double brandies to settle themselves down and that that was why the reading was off the Richter scale when they blew into the breathalyser. I am not suggesting that railway employees will use similar excuses, but the temptation will exist and should be guarded against.<br><br>
Another issue on which I seek a clarification from the Minister that of a "serious incident". What exactly is a "serious incident"? The Bill refers to the likelihood of death, injury or damage but the Minister will be aware that derailments occur regularly within marshalling yards or railway sidings where, for obvious reasons, the track is not maintained to the same standard. Who will decide whether such an incident merits the application of breathalyser equipment under clause 30? Usually, the local manager would decide whether to call in the police. I am aware of that, but further clarification from the Minister would be helpful.<br><br>
Is not the involvement of civil police on railway premises likely to lead to conflict between police constables and railway employees? Sometimes police officers exceed their duties and responsibilities. Under clause 30, what would prevent a police officer walking on to a railway station after an incident and demanding that a train driver be breathalysed? A police officer appears to possess that right, if my interpretation of clause 30 is correct. A person of a management or supervisory grade should be responsible for deciding whether the law should be invoked in those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. We have tried to mirror road traffic provisions, so we have not opted for a random-testing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
policy. Where a police constable suspects that someone may be under the influence of alcohol, he can require a test to be taken. That is reasonable and responsible.<br><br>
On the question of who would administer the tests, it would usually be a constable of the British Transport police, but that may not always be possible. We have talked about the extended new light railway schemes and the fact that the local constabulary might be involved. Sometimes a British Transport policeman might not be around, for example, where an accident has not occurred near a station.<br><br>
I hope that that is clear and concise. If the hon. Gentleman would like further assurance, I would be pleased to write to him—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With a specified time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, with a specified time. Tests are now available—I know that from what I have heard about some court cases—where it is possible to check when the alcohol went into the body. That may seem strange, but it is amazing what modern science can do.</span></p>
