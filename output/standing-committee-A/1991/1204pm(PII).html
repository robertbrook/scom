	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this United Kingdom Parliament, I have heard ad nauseam for the past three weeks about the alleged overspending and wastefulness of various local authorities up and down England. While I am sceptical about the claims made about my colleagues in local government in many English areas, I have noticed that not once has any Conservative Member uttered a word of criticism of any council in Scotland. That is not because Conservative Members agree with every decision that every Labour local authority makes in Scotland, and no doubt the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will offer his thoughts on that, but rather because they know nothing about Scotland. However, they will vote tonight to force legislation on Scotland that is neither wanted nor needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax was enforced against the will of the Scottish people by a separate Act. When we complained that the Scottish clauses were at the tail end of the Bill, Conservative Members shrugged their shoulders and laughed, as much as to say that because we had complained about a separate Act we could not now complain because Scottish legislation was in the same Bill. They do not realise that Scottish business has been pushed to the back of the queue. We lost all Scottish business yesterday. Tonight we have only managed to arrive at Scottish business after sharply reminding Conservative Members of the fact that it was still to be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be interesting to see how much knowledge and understanding of Scottish social conditions and the affairs of Scottish local authorities exists in Conservative Members. I expect there to be precious little. For example, we have heard them often enough in the Chamber talking about "subsidy junkies" in Scotland and claiming that Scotland gets more than its fair share of Government spending. Wandsworth will not impose a poll tax this year. If Wandsworth poll tax payers do not have a poll tax and are living poll tax free, it must be the rest of us who are paying for services in Wandsworth. Talk about subsidy junkies—look at Wandsworth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess to the hon. Lady that, although I am part Scots, I am completely ignorant about local government in Scotland. However, it would improve the quality of her speeches if she would accept that the contributions
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
from her hon. Friends about London have also been painfully ignorant. I shall not contribute to the debate on London. For the sake of good government and good legislation, I wish that some Opposition Members had not contributed so ignorantly to the debates on London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to my hon. Friend, I shall say that I have lived in London for the past four years since I was elected and I have seen the state of affairs in London boroughs. Much of that is related to deliberate underfunding. There is gross underfunding of London boroughs that the Government want to penalise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some Labour Members contribute to the poll tax in London as well as back home. We pay twice. We are subsidising twice the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I felt great indignation on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) when the Minister tried to be smart by saying that there was not much to be gained by saying that a council got less than the average. The Minister did not take account of the fact that people in Wigan have substantial social needs that are not met by the Government's fiddling of the system of grants to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real difference between my hon. Friend and myself and the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) is that he is happy to be a member of a Committee and vote on Scottish local government, even though he does not speak on it, whereas my hon. Friend and I would be delighted to serve on a Scottish Committee whose purpose was to examine the parts of the Bill that applied to Scotland. I should be happy not to sit opposite that hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Before anyone else attempts to waste my time by airing his views about any authority in England, let me say that I intend to talk about local government in Scotland. I shall talk about that and nothing else. If Conservative Members have any more to say about English local authorities, I remind them that they have had plenty of opportunity. If they have misused it, that is tought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way? She mentioned my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is about Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend did not mention Battersea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) berated us earlier because Scotland had voted for the Labour party and reasoned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
that a British Conservative Government should not interfere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wandsworth the electorate decided to increase the majority of the Conservative party at the last borough elections from a majority of 1 to a majority of 35. Would the hon. Lady listen to the voice of democracy in England in the same way as she asks us to respect the voice of democracy in Scotland? When the hon. Lady mentions Labour Members in London, will she remember that Labour Members have flooded into my constituency. I should add that the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) does not contribute to our economy, but many other Labour Members do. One house in my constituency has four Labour Members of Parliament living in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is coming to a close, Mr. Leadbitter, although you are right to remind me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members choose to live in Wandsworth because of the low charges and the high quality of the services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have known better than to give way. That point had nothing to do with Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wandsworth agrees with Government policies: people who live there pay no poll tax. Wandsworth will not be parted from the Tory point of view. If residents pay no poll tax, it is scarcely surprising that people choose to live there. When a Labour Government are elected, we shall make sure that Labour authorities get their fair share of grant, which will depend on the genuine needs of an area. We shall see what attitudes prevail then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have given way many times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word unreasonable does not appear in the clause. That is interesting, because for many years legislation for Scottish local authority spending was framed in terms of the action that the Government would take if spending was excessive and unreasonable. That phrase became famous throughout Scottish local government but, for some reason, it is no longer written into legislation. Could the reason be that if spending by a local authority was judged by the Government to be excessive and unreasonable, they could be in difficulty if a local authority was prepared to challenge them in the courts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On many occasions, a local authority has contemplated taking such action and has gone to the length of seeking counsel's advice. I think that one or two cases reached the courts but I cannot recall the exact details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members talk glibly about gross overspending by authorities who waste ratepayers' money and so on. I have carefully read all the external auditors' reports on Scottish local authorities for several years past and there has been no serious
	<span class='label label-info column'>882</span>
instance of an authority going well over the mark. There have been a few trifling criticisms but nothing of substance. The Minister laughs. I will give way now if he is prepared to name one Scottish authority charged with overspending that was considered to be excessive and unreasonable. He cannot do it, so that was a cheap laugh that meant absolutely nothing. The Minister is prepared to laugh but has no evidence to justify his cheap and nasty attitude to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the Minister would not wish loans funds to be used to make up a deficit between cash brought in and cuts that authorities were forced to make, but I want to know on what reasoning the Government base their proposal. After all, it is a local authority's money and not the Government's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde regional council feels under such pressure that it says that Scottish councils are fighting for the very survival of local government. In no sense is that an exaggeration. That council faces a deficit of £250 million and points to the high level of nonpayment of poll tax. Arrears will reach 30 per cent next year, so we are talking about nearly one third on people's bills and a cut in the council's budget of nearly £30 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that, far from trying to maintain the level of employment by heavy increases, the council is having to reduce jobs by no fewer than 750. That is a bitter pill to swallow in my constituency. Most of the constituencies in Glasgow have among the highest levels of unemployment in Britain. My constituency of Maryhill has the highest level of unemployment in the whole of Scotland and comes 15th in the statistics for Great Britain. Other Glasgow constituencies have unemployment levels close to that, so losing all those jobs in that area will have a knock-on effect on other jobs in the community because of lost spending power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a serious prospect for us, and before we hear the usual bleats from Conservative Members that the council would not face that loss of money if it tried harder to collect the poll tax, I wonder whether they have any idea about what is happening. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland probably knows the answer, but other Conservative Members do not have the remotest idea of how many warrants have been issued by Strathclyde regional council in an effort to bring in the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would any Conservative Member like to guess the number? Is it 10,000 or 20,000? The answer is that 1 million warrants have been issued in the area of Strathclyde regional council. The population of Strathclyde is about 2.5 million out of a total Scottish population of fewer than 5 million. If that is not making an effort to collect unpaid poll tax, I do not know what else the council is expected to do. Strathclyde is trying to get the money in and is finding it very difficult. Will Strathclyde region be capped? I hope that that question will be answered tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know also what is to happen with the district councils within Strathclyde, such as Glasgow. Is that council to be capped? Glasgow district council
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>883</span>
also needs poll tax revenue to fund its services, but it is not a precepting authority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is not making clear whether her references to the poll tax are linked to the reduction of revenues mentioned in clause 94, to which the amendments apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The uncollected money will have a knock-on effect not only on next year's poll tax but on the forthcoming council tax. I want to know whether authorities will be capped and, if so, which. Conservative Members may not realise that none of the district councils within Strathclyde are precepting authorities. They are not responsible for collecting the poll tax or the council tax. Will they be blamed if their income shortfall puts them in difficulties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was sad to see that, because of the time lost to the schoolboy japes perpetrated by Conservative Members earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) had to drop an important amendment calling for information to be given to local authority residents if their authority is to be capped. That principle applies just as much to England and Wales as to Scotland. Surely it is only fair that people should be told that their authority is to be capped, and why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago, when I was still a Glasgow district councillor, we were instructed by the then Secretary of State for Scotland to hand back the sum of 9p to each local ratepayer. We ran an effective campaign to tell local residents about the refund, explaining why it was being required and what cuts would ensue. I am not surprised that Conservative Members were so relieved when my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham had to drop the amendment. The last thing that they want is for local people to be fully informed about the reasons for and the impact of the Government's actions, or about what local authorities would do if they had the freedom to act as they saw fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been obvious throughout our proceedings that Conservative Members are unable to accept local democracy. They could not care less how often people vote Labour or in what numbers. They are interested only in getting their own way, as we have seen with hospital opt-out trusts and other issues. The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) asked earlier why I did not accept the decision of the people of Wandsworth. Why does he not accept that the vast majority of Scots do not want Tory policies? They have voted against them over and over again. They will vote against them once more in the forthcoming general election. If Conservative Members do not learn to listen to the Scottish people—they keep on losing Tory votes in Scotland every time one of them opens his mouth in the Chamber—in their every word and deed they will bear the responsibility for the break-up of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) and for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). As a former Strathclyde regional councillor I, like so many present Scottish Labour Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
have a local government background. The Government's authoritarian approach towards Scotland is creating a crisis. There will always be tension between England and Scotland, but the United Kingdom is, or was, a cohesive force. It relies on people having the ability to compromise and to see other people's points of view. I firmly support the Union. It is a travesty and a paradox that the so-called Conservative and Unionist party is the engine room for the independent and separation movement in Scotland. What a tragedy it will be if the intransigence of the Conservative party is behind the independence of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government represents so much of Scottish life. The Scottish Office must work with the grain of Scottish social life, Scottish opinion and, most important, with Scottish local government. I do not believe that 10 or 20 Conservative Members have, of necessity, created a crisis in Scotland. It would be the way in which the Scottish Office, which represents the Conservative Government, manages the situation that would determine whether there was a crisis. The Scottish Office seems to take great delight in snubbing local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will be in order only if he keeps referring to the amendment. He must not neglect it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bear in mind your invaluable advice, Mr. Leadbitter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussions that councils in Scotland will have with the Government on the council tax and capping will be set against the background of what happened in the past, when, time after time, the convenor and group leader of Strathclyde local authority met the then Secretary of State for Scotland to discuss expenditure. They were praised for their work and were told that they were doing a good job and then, suddenly, Strathclyde's revenue support grant was cut. It is all very well councils being praised for their work, but when the resources that are available to them are cut, real difficulties are caused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how local government will cope with the Government capping its resources. Local authorities must have the ability to raise their own finances, and I fully support their being accountable to the public at the ballot box. I take the Minister's point about Wandsworth. If its elections were held on a level playing field, I would accept the result. I await with interest the explanation of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), on how the councils in Scotland, England and Wales will cope with the practicalities of capping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with at least one of the points made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe). I shall not refer to conditions in London, partly because they are not relevant to the amendment and also because I have the misfortune to be a standard community charge payer in Lambeth. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) quoted what was said by a Conservative lady in 1945; "The people won't stand for it". That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>885</span>
was not a strong point because the people, of course, did not stand for it. Thereafter, they elected a Conservative Government until 1959.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must criticise the hon. Member for Cathcart for his outrageous attack on Scottish Office civil servants, who cannot answer back. When he said that he knew why Lothian region had been subject to capping, I thought that he was going to refer to the power and influence of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). I must put on record that Scottish Office civil servants implement fairly and objectively the laws of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn now to the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Cathcart. Listening to the hon. Gentleman's speech, one would have concluded that capping powers in Scotland are somehow new. That is simply untrue. Capping powers go back to 1929 and were updated and maintained by a Labour Government in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Under-Secretary is not trying to mislead the Committee, but until this Government came to power any so-called capping took the form of reducing grant if spending was considered to be too high. It did not consist of reducing the money that the council brought in during the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right that the details of the system have changed—I do not deny that for a moment. The basic capping provisions were confirmed by the Labour Government in 1947 and then again in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1966 when the then Secretary of State, the late Lord Ross of Marnock said that the Secretary of State should have
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary reserve powers to restrict grants where an authority fails to maintain standards or spends excessively."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will confirm that I am quoting accurately Lord Ross of Marnock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The major difference between what was said then and what this Government intend is the phrase "to maintain standards." The late Lord Ross realised that local authorities' grants should relate not only to whether they were spending too much, but to whether they were, on occasions, spending too little to maintain the services that they should be providing under law. That is the difference; this Government do not think about quality of service when considering local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. The then Secretary of State referred to reserve powers to maintain standards, but he was clear that that Labour Government believed it right—as did the Labour Government of 1945–50—to take powers to prevent excessive spending by local authorities. That is the difference between previous Labour

Governments and the position taken now by the Labour party in Scotland. The powers that we are taking under the Bill are much more detailed than the powers taken by previous Labour Governments. I do not deny that, but this is the first time that the Labour party is going into a general election in Scotland saying clearly and unequivocally that it will take no reserve powers to control local authority expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intervention of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), which implied that because there was no minimum spending there was no interest in quality, betrays the confusion of the Labour party in relating the amount it spends to the quality of service. Efficient management of local government resources can produce a better quality of service at lower cost. That is why the people of Scotland, and of England and Wales—I agree with the hon. Member for Cathcart that we are still a United Kingdom—are not served well by the Labour party and need the capping facility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Opposition Members referred to election results, so I should like to put it on record that in the regional elections the constituency of Eastwood, including Eastwood district, resulted in a Tory landslide, with swings to the Conservative party in Eastwood, North and Eastwood, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That swing was from the Liberals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a point; there was a bigger swing against the Liberal Democrats than against Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have also to point out that Eastwood is not a regional but a district local authority. In the last district elections in Eastwood, the Labour party gained the first seat that it has ever won in Eastwood. Even I did not win when I stood as a candidate in Eastwood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on the electorate's judgment when it has the opportunity to vote for the hon. Member for Cathcart. However, I believe that it was in the regional elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not Labour won a seat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the Labour party won one district seat, largely because the other parties did not contest it. The Conservative vote went up in those elections and it will increase sufficiently in the forthcoming district elections for the Conservatives to regain that seat. Eastwood district will once again become a Labour-free zone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that that Labour-free zone is a lesson for the rest of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, but it may take a little time more before the rest of Scotland follows Eastwood's example.

It is clear that the Labour party in Scotland will fight the next election on a new platform—Labour wants no capping or reserve powers of any description to control local authority expenditure. The Labour party will also enter that election committed to bringing back the rating system in a slightly different version, but a version that is essentially the old rating system with four types of valuation instead of one. The Labour party will take off the caps on the increases of non-domestic rates. That is a clear difference, not only between the two sides of the Committee, but between what the Labour party argues now and the position that Labour Governments consistently took in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made that general point, I turn to more specific items. The hon. Members for Cathcart and for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) particularly wanted to know why we are changing those powers. The powers prior to the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991 were selective and had little effect in deterring general overspending. Opposition Members will recall that when the community charge was introduced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), the then Secretary of State for Scotland, he was content to retain the existing powers because he believed that local accountability would be the main spur to local authorities to set prudent budgets. As was demonstrated by the outrageously high charges originally set for the current year, authorities ignored the interests of their charge payers, particularly in the year following local elections. I believe that it is the Government's duty to protect local tax payers generally from the excesses of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple fact is that those local charge payers whom the Minister is so anxious to defend, are the same electors who voted in those local councils. He must not use that argument. I accept that he may use the argument about central Government financial planning, but the Minister has no right to argue that he is protecting the electors from themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was developing my argument and I shall explain it further to the hon. Gentleman. The view of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands was that the community charge had a high degree of accountability, so reserve powers were all that was necessary. Experience suggests that in certain years—notably the year after an election—the degree of accountability was reduced substantially. It is also true that the council tax is a change in the taxation system. I confirm yet again to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that the council tax is a 50 per cent personal tax and a 50 per cent property tax. It therefore has, in principle, a much lower level of accountability than was the case under the community charge. It is reasonable to change the system so that it is the same as exists in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear about the Government's reasoning. I am not aware of any publicity material explaining this matter. The hon. Member for Eastwood tells us that the poll tax created a high
	<span class='label label-info column'>888</span>
degree of accountability. However, when the Government did not get their way because the people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly against it and showed massed support for Labour local authorities at regional and district elections, it became a shambles. Now that the Government have devised this new tax, they think that they need more draconian powers to impose their will and to protect people against themselves. Let us have that on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not what I am saying. I am repeating what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands made clear. In the context of the community charge he believed that a reserve power was needed—Labour Governments have historically taken reserve powers. The circumstances clearly changed when we moved away from the community charge, particularly in the last year of that system after the regional elections. It was clear that the argument about accountability no longer applied. That argument works better the year before elections than it does the year immediately after elections, for fairly obvious reasons. That is the thinking behind the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pursuant to the hon. Lady's argument, people tended to vote Labour because the Labour party promised them that it would buy their votes with other people's money. That was the essence of the rates system, and it is the essence of Labour's fair rates system. The Labour party is nakedly seeking to buy people's votes with other people's money. The reason that some people did not like the community charge and sought every opportunity to vote against it was perfectly understandable—for the first time in their lives they were being asked to make a contribution to local government services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right about the Labour party's proposals. It wants to return to a form of rates without any control of local authority expenditure. Under such a system, a minority of people would pay, not the majority. The majority of voters could legitimately and in their own interests vote for increased expenditure knowing that they would not have to pay. I do not blame people for taking that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who does not pay for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am making—one that has been made by many people for a long time—is that rates were borne by only a minority of the electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple fact is that, like the poll tax and the council tax, the rates carried joint and several liability. For example, in Scotland, on the basis that all couples were jointly and severally liable for the rates, 78 per cent of the population were liable to pay it when the system disappeared in 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true if one defines it in that way, but, generally, the bill was paid by only one person per household. The burden of rates—a heavy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>889</span>
burden—fell on a relatively small portion of the electorate. Therefore, the accountability argument, which applies to the community charge, did not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's reluctance to give way because he might have realised that what he just said has been contradicted by the Secretary of State for the Environment. Does he acknowledge that contradiction, or does he think that it does not matter because the principles are different on each side of the border?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have said anything with which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment would disagree. I have been explaining a decision that was taken openly, over a period of time, by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands. The hon. Member for Cathcart alleged that the criteria that will be used for capping, to which the amendments refer, were somehow irrational and that they had not been discussed with local authorities. That is absolute nonsense. The basis for the comparison of expenditure must be well-defined. In order to calculate grant-aided expenditure, we use a methodology, which is well-established and which has been agreed following consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. If hon. Members wish to study the document, which comprises some 52 pages, it is available in the House of Commons Library. It sets out in detail the basis for calculating the grant-aided expenditure figures. It is nonsense to allege that the system is irrational and that it has been devised without consulting local authorities. The basis for calculating the grant-aided expenditure figures is the subject of on-going consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I do not suggest that COSLA agrees with the principles of capping, but the technical basis of the system is produced as a consequence of technical work and a great deal of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill asked me about amendment No. 320. It would enable a local authority to offset reduced council tax income by borrowing from the loans fund. The amendment would enable a council to reduce its council tax without a corresponding reduction in expenditure. Given that a reduction in council tax by capping is initiated by excessive expenditure, it would be perverse to permit that excessive expenditure to be incurred by borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Cathcart and for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) asked for details of the capping criteria. The provisional criteria were set out by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 14 October so that authorities—including Strathclyde— know precisely where they are when setting their budgets. The criteria are the subject of consultation. My right hon. Friend will take into account the representations that he has received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Strathclyde?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>890</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strathclyde could have a maximum increase in spending of between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent without exceeding the provisional criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members accused the Government of constantly attacking Strathclyde and other regional councils, but the Government have never capped Strathclyde, for the good reason that Strathclyde has generally set its budgets at about the grant-aided expenditure level. If Lothian had followed Strathclyde's example, it would not have been subjected to selective action. The hon. Member for Maryhill suggested that no local authority auditor in Scotland had said that an authority's expenditure was excessive and unreasonable. Technically, that statement is correct, because it is not a matter for the auditor. The auditor's role is not to comment on the level of expenditure but on whether it was properly incurred. The auditor must decide whether expenditure was ultra vires; he is not concerned with the level of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system that we propose for the capping of Scottish local authorities has the great merit of being set out well ahead of when the authorities determine their budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I ask the Minister to comment on my amendment, which removes the word "not" from subsection (4). If the clause stands as drafted, the council tax might not be set until well after 11 March in any financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to amendment No. 312, which is unworkable, as it would require a reduced council tax to be fixed by 11 March. That would negate the scope for proper consideration of the need for a reduced tax. While Scottish local authorities may agree with some of the hon. Gentleman's comments, I cannot believe that they would agree with the aim of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisional criteria have been set out clearly for Scottish local authorities so that they can take them fully into account before their budgets are set. There is no reason why any Scottish local authority should be capped. The capping applies to expenditure, not to the level of the community charge. The arguments about non-collection do not apply to the capping criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the reasons for non-collection, but I shall put on record that the hon. Member for Cathcart is right to say that he never advocated nonpayment. The non-payment campaign did enormous damage in Scotland. It was led by the Scottish National party, although some members of the Labour party supported it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capping criteria are clear and reasonable. They are necessary, but if Scottish local authorities budget reasonably this year, none will find itself capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two major changes in the clause but the Minister has explained neither of them. He talked all round the subject, but never explained why the term "and unreasonable" was being taken out of the Scottish legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) is right. It has been taken out because that sort of phrase can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>891</span>
be challenged in a court of law, but, on its own, the word "excessive" probably cannot. The Minister has deliberately obfuscated the matter. I shall be delighted if he will now explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that I did explain the point. The previous criteria were highly selective and could not deal with the general problem of overspending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Maryhill referred to this matter. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will confirm that no Scottish local authority has taken court action against the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend did not say that they had; she said that several local authorities have considered it. They have taken counsel's advice and have advised the Government that they would take court action unless the Government negotiated and came to some agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will use their judgment about what is and what is not excessive. On nearly every item of expenditure, Lothian region has a lower level per head of population expenditure than Strathclyde and nearly every other region. But, it is likely to be the one region that may be capped this year and perhaps in future years. Unfortunately, unlike Strathclyde and other regions, poor old Lothian region, has had Tory administrations in the past. They have deliberately kept the spending down on services which have been poor, so when a Labour administration tries to provide services, for which the people voted, the Government say, "Your increases are excessive, and, even though they are not on the same level as other regions, we are going to cap you." The region's expenditure is not excessive, but the Government consider that the increase in expenditure is excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talks about protecting the poll tax payer. I emphasise that we are talking about electors who have elected that local authority. My majority in Cathcart could not be 11,000 and we could not have won Strathkelvin and Bearsden, Edinburgh, Central, Edinburgh, South or Renfrew, West and Inverclyde unless large numbers of middle-class voters who live in big, highly-rated houses were voting for us. The simple fact is that the Government stood on the poll tax in the 1987 general election and we stood on the rating system. Many people who were paying high rates voted Labour because they knew that the Government's system was unfair. They will make that same judgment in the coming general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the local level, it is undemocratic to deny local councils the right to decide what services they should have and the ability to raise the money as they believe the electorate wish it to be raised. The Government's expenditure on the grant to local authorities is a matter for them, but to take a decision that central Government will fly in the face of local democracy is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have no respectability in Scotland. The people of Scotland have rejected the Tories time and again at local and national level. They do not want them. Why should Tory Ministers know what is best for local councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>892</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman talk of respectability and how he extrapolated that. Given that the Labour party has been wiped off the face of the political map below a line from Bristol to the Wash, with the exception of about 20 seats in London, what respectability does the Labour party have in vast swathes of England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look at the front page of the 	<i>Daily Mail.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving aside my hon. Friend's point about the front page of the 	<i>Daily Mail—</i>although he is right—the way in which the United Kingdom is run means that Scotland is administered separately from the rest of the country. The south of England is not administered separately. There is no Secretary of State for the south of England, although there may appear to be. There is no Minister of State, or Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the south of England, but there is for Scotland. For example, Scotland is legislated for separately in the Bill. Legislation may be within the one Bill, but it is different and separate. That is why we are entitled to say that the way in which the Government handle Scottish business in the House—nothing to do with devolution—is bringing Westminister into disrepute in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are creating enormous problems for people like myself who want Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. I am a unionist, not a separatist. I do not want to see Scotland become independent. Conservative Members who bring the Government into disrepute by the way in which they run their affairs, and who, like the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman), try to cause trouble between England and Scotland, make my job more difficult as a Member of Parliament who wants to see Scotland remain part of the Union. Until Conservative Members, including Scottish Office Ministers, learn that lesson, they are driving Scotland towards an end which most of the Scottish people do not want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am surprised that the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) did not move her amendment, as it is an important contribution to the debate. I was looking forward to welcoming what the hon. Lady might have said about spending on social services in Devon. I was also looking forward to hearing her views on how much councillor Saxon Spence had assisted with social security spending when Devon was a hung county and the Labour party played the pivotal role in making possible such spending—normally, a Liberal Democratic role.

As we are coming to the final day of our sittings, I want to place on the record that I think that the Committee system is absurd. It contributes little to the scrutiny and revision of legislation or the sensible debate of important issues, especially when 10 pm is passed either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. I look forward to the day when the House organises its business sensibly.

I am grateful to those hon. Members who stayed until 2 am last night when I had already gone home, especially my hon.

Here we are, Mr. Leadbitter. I had better be careful how often I use that phrase, in case it appears in the Peterborough column of the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i>— courtesy of the Under-Secretary who clearly feels, as I do, that occasionally one's mind wanders in Committee unless there is something to concentrate on, such as, in my case, the phraseology of Conservative Members.

Last Thursday the Secretary of State for Social Security answered a question planted on behalf of the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) which was answered at the time that the Minister of State and, I think, the phantom Secretary of State for the Environment held a press conference. They revealed—and we should welcome this, as we welcomed clause 100—that they would not only abolish the 20 per cent council tax contribution from 1 April 1993 but that they were not intent on clawing back the entire amount mat had allegedly been paid out as compensation for the 20 per cent contributions under the present rebate scheme. The Secretary of State for Social Security claims that that will cost £680 million, although other people have calculated that it will be £580 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is still a lot of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is £100 million between friends? It is a lot of money, of course, and would make a considerable improvement to the scheme. It is either £580 million or £680 million. Conservative Members have been told that some of that money will be clawed back in any case and that it will not cost all that much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all accept that £100 million, £400 million or £600 million is a great deal of money, but compared with the £4.25 billion that the Government found in order to reduce everyone's costs by £140 per head—it did not greatly affect those paying the minimum amount—it is a mere nothing and is being much better and much more selectively used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend's point. It adds to the questions that I am about to put. I am sorry to break off, Mr. Leadbitter, but there is a tendency in this Committee for people to sneeze without using handkerchiefs or tissues. We are close to the end of our proceedings and have not caught the flu or pneumonia, which is what I caught last time I served on a Committee considering a major local government finance Bill. It was not on the Committee stage of the Community Charges (Substitute Setting) Act 1991, or the paving Bill, but on the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which introduced the poll tax, that I caught viral pneumonia. I am very sensitive to this, which is why I keep raising the issue. I should like people to adhere to the old adage, "Coughs and sneezes spread diseases". I would also like to ask that your officials switch on the fan at some point, Mr. Leadbitter, so that we can breathe properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be diverted by the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) because I am about to embark on a serious issue. Although I was light in my comments at about 1 o'clock last week in the 12 midnight to 2 am sitting, I appreciate that at this earlier time we should deal with issues more seriously. May I say, for the benefit 	<i>of Hansard,</i> that the fan has come on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been promised that the 20 per cent contribution will go from 1 April 1993. It is regrettable that it will not go from 1 April 1992. I understand that the reasoning given by the Minister at the press conference—I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong—was that the principle underlying the poll tax, that everyone should pay something, would continue to apply as the poll tax is to remain for a further 16 months. That is an extraordinary admission. The Minister is willing to cling to the last vestiges of the poll tax, even after we have passed clause 100 abolishing it. The lingering doubt in the Minister's mind is that, if the Conservative party wins the general election, there might be a counter-coup to overturn the present Prime Minister and that the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) might get the previous Prime Minister back into office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that happened, it may be that the poll tax would be restored, in some form or other. I can think of no other reason why the Government would not want to abolish the 20 per cent contribution as fast as is administratively possible. By any logic, abolition of that 20 per cent rule would be a political advantage for the Government, ahead of the election. It would also help administratively, in that it would increase and accelerate collection rates. Moreover, it would aid local government officers to follow the tax through and help the magistrates courts to process the millions of summonses that have been and will be taken out. Abolition of the 20 per cent contribution would also allow those liable for more than that amount to be pursued more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, abolition from next April makes a lot of sense, but not to this Government. They do not accept that argument, even though retention undermines confidence in the legal system and in people's willingness to pay the tax; nor do they accept that it will exacerbate the consequent difficulty of getting them to pay whatever new tax is instituted from 1993. The Government are not prepared to write off the accumulating deficits, so the difficulty of collecting, in 1993 and onwards, the residue of the poll tax as well as the new council tax will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the dilemma. The Government admit that they were wrong and that people should not have been made to pay the 20 per cent contribution. The myth was that people should pay personally, rather than as a household. But the Minister, a renowned ideologue who deserves respect for his views, if not his consistency, has to vote for the council tax and for abolition of the 20 per cent contribution in order to keep his job, even though he is still clinging to the poll tax. That is to be regretted, because he has considerable talent and by his own admission is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>897</span>
hard man. However, he is not hard enough to give up his job. His attachment to the principles that he espouses is not greater than his desire to hold on to office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All politicians understand that very well. From time to time such dilemmas will assail all members of the Labour and Conservative parties, because we are faced with difficult choices. No choice could be more difficult than that faced by the Minister who is with us tonight, or by the Minister of State, Scottish Office, who used to be the chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland. His dilemma is the greater because he was even more of a wildcat in support of the poll tax than the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from merely being a wildcat in support of the poll tax in Scotland as my hon. Friend described him, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) could almost be regarded as its author. The first reference to a poll tax that I saw, long before the Conservative party proposed it, was in articles and pamphlets by the hon. Member for Stirling which were published by the Adam Smith Institute. He not only supported the poll tax but can be blamed for the whole stupid exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully agree with my hon. Friend. It is clear that the hon. Member for Stirling made a substantial contribution to the poll tax. His love of it was far greater at that time than his love of political expediency in Scotland. However, his love of office was even greater than his love for the poll tax and his insistence on persuading the Scottish people that it was good for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a bit unfair to describe the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland as a wildcat. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who am I to disagree with someone who knows the hon. Gentleman better than I do?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) and said that his love of keeping office overcame his love of principle. No one can beat the love of trying to get into office while abandoning principles than the leader of the Labour party, whether they relate to defence, renationalisation, clause 4 or any other of the shibboleths of socialism. The right hon. Gentleman is trying to convince the electorate that he is jettisoning them as quickly as he can. Surely the right hon. Gentleman takes the biscuit, not my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that any Labour Member needs lectures from anyone who introduced something as absurd as the poll tax and discarded it in less than a year after its introduction in England

and Wales. After having inflicted it on the people of Scotland for two years, the Government decided that it was an unmitigated catastrophe and abolished it, after having spent £10 billion of our money and increasing value-added tax by 2.5 per cent to raise the amount needed to reduce the headline tax by £140. There has never been such a somersault in the history of British politics. Any review of politics made by any Labour Member will never come close to the about-turn that the Government made on the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I keep hearing voices echoing off the walls. An hon. Friend of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) calls him Essex man. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) pointed out, the 	<i>Daily Mail</i> concluded that Essex men, presumably goaded by the last part of "Spitting Image" on Sunday night, have decided to rationalise their views and increase their intelligence quotient by voting for Labour candidates at the general election. I warn the hon. Member for Thurrock that that dangerous trend towards rationality is likely to sweep him away. Even white socks and cans of lager are unlikely to save him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not Essex man, but Lancashire man talking. I am pleased to hear that Essex man is joining the Labour party, so raising the intelligence of both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) was making a serious point. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) referred to somersaults and my hon. Friend suggested that the Labour party had performed a remarkable somersault in relation to Europe, not just once, but several times. How does the hon. Gentleman react to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought with your displeasure, Mr. Leadbitter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever else the European Community may offer, it has never thought of inflicting a poll tax on us. Ministers in Strasbourg and Brussels scratch their heads and wonder whether it is a good idea to integrate economically with us in case we have any other similarly crazy ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us return to the question in hand about the way in which the Government announced the proposal to abolish the 20 per cent under the council tax, but also to claw back some of the resources that had been available under community charge reduction and rebate schemes. By doing so, they will save themselves £200 million. The nearly poor are to pay for the very poor. The hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) was right in his reference to the emphasis on Europe, which diverted media attention from the incredible sleight of hand in the announcement last Thursday.

Had the Secretary of State been with us, he would doubtless have enlightened us, in his inimitable way, about the circumstances. However, as he is absent, we shall deal with the detail instead, which clearly would have been totally beyond him. I know that the Minister is fully cognisant of that as he is forced to mind the Secretary of State when the right hon. Gentleman has to deal with anything more complicated than adding up more than l0p and 5p at one time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saving £200 million on the present expenditure that goes into various forms of rebate or abatement of the poll tax, the Government have also dealt us another sleight of hand, with which hon. Members might not be so familiar. In April 1988, when the iniquitous 1986 social security benefit changes were implemented, Conservative Members revolted in bewilderment at what they had actually voted for after people complained to them in their surgeries. In the upheaval of April 1988 they kept saying, "We've done something terrible here. Please let us off the hook. Please increase the disregard levels and change the amount of capital that our constituents can hold before they are disregarded for benefit."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is desperate to make an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to point out that the Minister of State was the prime hatchet man in the introduction of the benefit changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I allowed my hon. Friend to make that point. The hard man the Minister of State, who is helping other hard men such as the Prime Minister, who is also familiar with social security reductions for the very poor—it seems to be not so much a road to Maastricht as a road to Downing street—knows only too well how the benefit system has been altered. He knows that a 50p reduction was made to fund the £1.30 allegedly given to compensate people for the 20 per cent contribution to poll tax that the very poorest were forced to make. If uprating since April 1988, which amounts to just over 19 per cent, is taken into account, the total is £250 million. If we deduct that from the £580 million—the alleged cost of taking into account the variant figures put out in the last week—the Government will have to recoup only £350 million from other areas to pay for the abolition of the 20 per cent contribution. Given a suitable adjustment
	<span class='label label-info column'>900</span>
to the Rossi index, it probably will cost the Treasury nothing if the Conservative party is re-elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who provided me with briefs said that it was necessary to give the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Security credit for persuading the Treasury to come up with the money to abolish the 20 per cent contribution. My riposte to those who are well-meaning but naive enough to believe that, is that the Treasury has reached a deal with the Departments concerned that will not involve the Treasury having to cough up any money at all. If we take the £250 million and the £200 million overall saving on reduction schemes and rebates, on which questions were asked at the press conference last Thursday, we get down to £150 million, which can easily be accounted for in the hints that the Rossi index will be altered still further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend clarify this point? Given that it costs about £15 to collect £6, because of the 20 per cent, is a saving of £9 per transaction included in my hon. Friend's calculation on savings to the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not taken that calculation into account. Perhaps there is a real danger that, far from the Treasury having to find money, it will make a profit by abolishing the 20 per cent contribution. It is amazing how, even in the depths of the night, we can stumble on something that we had not realised before and that it will turn out to be worse than our nightmares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I reply I shall make a thorough job of demolishing the hon. Gentleman's extraordinary claims. To do so properly, I want to be certain that I have followed what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I understand his argument that £680 million is really £580 million, but I shall return to that. Secondly, I understand where he has made a mistake in relation to the first £200 million reduction. However, I am not clear about the second £250 million reduction. Is it related to the alleged 50p that was taken off or does it come from a different source or from the 50p source and from somewhere else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to help the Minister. The 50p source was part of the £600 million reduction in benefits implemented in April 1988, consequent on the 1986 changes and the clawback in 1988. The Minister is right: that is what I alluded to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat: whatever happens, as with disability changes and allowances under that heading, the benefits recorded to the very poorest are not paid for by the very rich but by the nearly poor. That has happened whenever the Government have announced a measure that was supposed to benefit those who are worst off. That is a pretty rotten trick and it has not received as wide an exposure as I and my hon. Friends would wish, mainly because the very well off who occasionally report these issues in the media, if they can drag themselves away from other things—especially those in the BBC—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite open about it. I attacked the BBC in the mid-1980s because it would not appoint someone to concentrate specifically on local government. My reply from the then Director General was that it would appoint someone when local government issues became a serious political matter. The BBC did appoint someone very able who took an interest in local government issues. I regret, however, that the current local government radio spokesman appears to have overlooked the existence of the council tax and the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says disgraceful, and I agree with him. It is disgraceful to be a spokesman on an issue and not to turn up for debates on the major Bill or, indeed, to cover it at all. On the "Today" programme a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State for the Environment explained how he proposed to spend £9 million over three years on environmental matters. Is spending £9 million over three years more important and worthy of coverage than the introduction of a new financial base for local government and changes to the benefit structure which amount to hundreds of millions of pounds? Anyone who believes that it is more important is either culpable or incompetent. That example is typical of the way in which the British media ignore major domestic political issues because they cannot be bothered about them or do not understand their significance. I would be happy to repeat my remarks outside the House if anyone wants to hold me to account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend is being too harsh. The BBC commentators may be too busy answering telephone calls from irate Conservatives who have been encouraged by the chairman of the Conservative party to complain about the coverage that the BBC gives to Labour politicians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could certainly be the case, especially in the run-up to a general election, when sensitivities, especially mine, run high in all parties. I am irritated because our debate is critical to the future well being of tens of millions of people, and to the services and health of local government. If those things are unimportant I am wrong, and people will write to me and say so. I shall return to the matter in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.55 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to refer to the key issue of who will gain and who will lose under the proposals. I welcome the abolition of the 20 per cent contributions without a 100 per cent clawback of the amount due. The Government have made it clear that they will worsen the taper for those who are above supplementary benefit entitlement. As I tried to point out this afternoon during questions about
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
the environment, that will penalise those who have been thrifty, stood on their own feet and secured pensions in addition to the basic state pension, or those with a job or with savings. People who fall between supplementary benefit entitlement and the point at which the rebate entitlement runs out will be penalised. Steepening the taper from 15p in the pound to 20p in the pound will lead to rebate being withdrawn from people who would otherwise have been entitled to it and will also reduce the rebate entitlement of those who remain entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who were formerly entitled will be disqualified from relief under the new system. It will be no good telling them that those who previously had to pay 20 per cent will no longer have to pay. Such people will have to struggle as much as the very poor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That problem is prevalent in mining communities, where elderly couples may receive a pension award from British Coal and, in addition, a small sum—perhaps a few thousand pounds—as compensation for pneumoconiosis. Because of interest, they might find that that amount is taxed at 97p in the pound. These people may receive no benefit whatsoever, even though they have a very low income. Their small amount of capital is put aside for funerals and family presents at Christmas. They are poor pensioners, but they are penalised as though they had substantial resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That clearly underlines my point. People who are just above the supplementary benefit base level have been the subject of much discussion during the past few years. I have to say— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] For the sake of the Under-Secretary's record, and for another column in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> I have to say that I, for one, am wholly in favour of providing help to those who have helped themselves. I was brought up with that idea, but the notion that Conservatives believe it—so many of those who speak for the Conservative party have never had to struggle but have fallen on their feet— leaves me cold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We Labour Members should say more often that we are in favour of those who have struggled to help themselves—those who have had the foresight to pay for a small superannuation pension, those who have struggled in part-time jobs when it would have been much easier to live on benefits, or those who have some form of allowance that recognises their invalidity or special disability needs. That is why help for those who are above supplementary benefit levels is included in the "Fair Rates" benefit proposals. If we do not help those people, we make the poverty trap harsher and push people into relying on benefits rather than on their own efforts. That is a grave disadvantage in what the Conservative party calls the enterprise society. I would call it a sensible way of carrying on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a significant point. If they were honest with us, it is a problem that all Governments face when setting benefit levels. There will always be a point where some people are at the edge. The taper puts people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
not on the edge of poverty but plunges them right into it. Given the way that a small sum is used in the calculations, no assistance is allowed to poll tax payers. I know of thousands of such cases in my area, where couples have to pay the full amount. They end up with less disposable income than people on income support, who make only a 20 per cent contribution. That causes much hostility and heartache among working-class people, many of whom have put a little money aside over the years for their retirement but then find that their effort is dissipated because of the taper system. That will be a problem in any system, but it is grossly unfair under the present system, because the Government have known of it for a considerable time yet have made no effort to amend it. Some people are forced into poverty, with less disposable income than those on income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman does make an important point, but under the present and the future system the taper system will go above income support. It will go down to zero for income support and will go some way above income support. We also have a tapering system for savings and assets. The hon. Gentleman often makes comparisons with the European Community—indeed, he seeks harmonisation with the Community. Is he aware that in most European countries people with savings suffer an immediate cut off and do not receive benefit. The Labour party should be a little more critical in making comparisons with Europe about the real worries expressed by the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's point is strictly true. I do not think that other European Community countries have rules that operate as he suggests. I shall also put on record that while I am in favour of the social action programme, I have never pretended that we should simply follow what is done in Europe. I am a great believer that Britain should be a leader in Europe, not a pathetic follower. Once we are clear what it is we want to lead on, we might not be led by the nose by others. That is a lesson for the debate next week in Maastricht.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield referred to those who are currently entitled to benefit, but who will run out of entitlement at a lower income point and will be disadvantaged. For example, a single parent with earnings might be in a position to claim family credit and have a bill of £5 a week, or roughly £260 a year. That person will be disadvantaged to the tune of £1.77 a week. That sort of sum on an income of £90 or £100 a week makes a hell of a difference. It could be the difference between the milk and the bread and not merely the luxuries that so many of us take for granted these days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that there will be losers in a scheme where the taper is strengthened from 15p to 20p. The Labour party has had discussions in preparation for government and it
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
would lessen the taper. It may not be possible to return to the 6p taper that existed before 1982, when different calculations were made about net and gross sums, but we would like to improve the operation of the taper so that it does not disadvantage those helping themselves, those in work or single or two-pension households. The proposed scheme will emphasise and exaggerate the poverty trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A social security document was leaked in August. I remember it well because I went on to the "Today" programme to talk about it. The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities was in Taunton listening to me because those concerned had not managed to contact him to do a joint interview. It was in the days when Labour spokesmen on the environment could get on Radio 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bad old days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the Minister feels that those were the bad old days. I was on my own talking about the document that had come from the Department of Social Security. The Minister has now remembered. Last Thursday, the press conference announced that the Government had decided to scrap the proposals in that document. There are some features that linger, however, in the proposals on two-person households, in the case of someone who is seeking a benefit who is not the liable person but the second person in the household. According to last Thursday's announcement, the liable person will be able to claim the second adult rebate so that the benefit can be maximised. Will the Minister tell us how that system will operate? I assume that the rebate can be claimed if the person is not in receipt of a rebate already. The bill will not have been reduced by the 25 per cent discount for other adults in the home, which we discussed and which is disregarded under schedule 1. All other adults in the home will have incomes below £130. All that is built into the calculations, as we understand it from the brief answer and the press conference. It will not be possible to make a claim if the second adult is the partner of the liable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are thus a number of provisos and it would be helpful if the Minister could spell out more clearly the terms of entitlement in the part of the announcement dealing with the social security document to which I referred. What should have been a welcome announcement for everyone has been somewhat sullied by the Government's constant need to claw back, which shows that they are ungenerous in dealing with those at the bottom and just above the bottom of the income ladder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the issues that we are exploring tonight because it would be wrong for the successor to the poll tax to disadvantage people all over again, as the poll tax in other ways disadvantaged so many millions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two issues must be made clear. First, the Government can hold out no longer against withdrawing the 20 per cent rule from next year. It should go. Secondly, there must be a guarantee that income support will not be clawed back.

There seems to be some queasiness, if not ambiguity and conflict of attitude, among Conservative Members. I appeared with the right hon. Member for Brent, North (Sir Rhodes Boyson) on television yesterday to discuss the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). The right hon. Gentleman conceded in the debate that, instead of his hon. Friend's amendment, it would be much better if the Government agreed to abolish the 20 per cent rule now. That reflects a change of approach by some Conservative Members. It is surprising that the Government are holding out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the start there has been a basic contradiction in the ideology. According to the notion of universality, everybody must pay, regardless of income and inability to pay. That approach may seem laudable but it is in direct conflict with a means-tested benefit system. The Government now refer to means testing as targeting, so we shall accept the change in the language. However, universality and means testing, or targeting, cannot operate together. That is the basic contradiction that is built into the poll tax and the reason why it was so unfair to poorer people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of income support was to support the income of poorer people. It could be argued that everybody should pay his rent and rates, or rent and poll tax, and we would agree, but people should not be expected to pay those out of their income support. If they have no other source of income because they have no job, the money that they receive should provide for their basic bills. However, the Government's approach is to lower the level of income support and to knock off, as it were, rent, rates or poll tax. To penalise that income is a double injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must stop the hon. Gentleman before he gets too carried away. Of course, it is possible to have a system that combines universality and sensitivity to individual circumstances. Child benefit is a universal benefit. Family credit, which was introduced by the Government, is sensitive to the circumstances of individual families. The hon. Gentleman should not argue too much against universality or he might argue for the introduction of sensitivity into the pension arrangements, and that would be unsocialistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with the hon. Lady's argument is that child benefit is not means tested. It is a universal benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I have just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Family credit is a means-tested benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the purpose of my statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just let me finish. The difficulty is that the Government have said that income support
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
covers the universal payments and is a means-tested benefit. It is the only benefit that tries to combine, albeit badly, both means testing and universality. The other benefits fall into one category or the other. Until 1 April 1988, everyone on supplementary benefit, as it was—it has been called income support since the Fowler review, as it is described—received 100 per cent rebate if he paid rates because it was a means-tested system. If someone did not have enough money to pay his or her bills, the principle was able to take that into account. The new system of income-related benefit, which was introduced in April 1988, allowed only those who received rate rebates to qualify for a maximum rebate of 80 per cent so that everyone was required to pay 20 per cent of his rates. The 20 per cent principle was introduced during the last year of the rates to prepare for the universal principle of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that that principle of a 20 per cent contribution was carried forward from the rate rebate to the poll tax rebate system. Everyone was required, however low his income, to pay, at least, 20 per cent of his poll tax bill. It surprises me that the Government have now conceded that that principle is unjust and that they have agreed that people on low incomes will, again, qualify for 100 per cent council tax rebates from April 1993. Why are the Government holding out against critical opposition from the Labour party, public bodies outside the House of Commons and even some Conservative Members, such as the right hon. Member for Brent, North? There does not seem to be any logical or economic reason—it is bad financial management— or any reason of principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend ask the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) if he still believes that the 20 per cent payment should not be abolished in April 1992? On 12 November, he said that claimants, who have been compensated for the 20 per cent payment would be having their cake and eating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Thursday, we were told that there would be no clawback. So, the philosophy behind having one's cake and eating it no longer applies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) will tell the Committee whether he still believes that people have their cake and eat it if they do not get a clawback.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not remember using the phrase "having one's cake and eating it". However, I said that if a local authority set its community charge at or below target, claimants will not need the element of income support, which was designed to cover a 20 per cent payment of community charge. I also said that because the borough in my constituency has a zero charge, less well off residents benefit to an even greater extent because they do not have to find any of the 20 per cent. That was my point; it is not a matter of having one's cake and eating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) fairly asks about the next stage. The fact that there will be a 100 per cent rebate means that the issue of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
20 per cent ceases to be relevant once the new council tax is with us. It is relevant between now and then but, then ceases to be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention because he highlights the problem. The problem is that if the money is knocked off the benefit, but not related to the poll tax level, some people may gain but many others will lose. That is the problem with linking it in a means-tested way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who pay the 20 per cent minimum contribution may have severe financial difficulties. Paying a 20 per cent contribution may cause hardship if the poll tax level is high, and we should take account of that. It is assumed that 20 per cent is a notional figure and that people can chip in a few bob because it will not make much difference, but it can make a significant difference to some people's income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), who was one of the great architects of the poll tax, said in an article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> on 8 March 1991:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The charge is higher than people on low incomes can afford because the rebate system has become totally inadequate. It was designed in 1988 when we expected community charges to be much lower than they turned out to be".</p></blockquote>
That comment highlights the problem. I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman would vote for the abolition of the 20 per cent contribution. I hope that we vote on its abolition on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the resonses to the consultation paper "A New Tax for Local Government", those calling for the immediate abolition of the minimum 20 per cent contribution included the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Association of London Authorities, the Association of District Councils, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Society of London Treasurers. Evidence for abolishing the 20 per cent payment is building up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of the abolition of the 20 per cent, the Audit Commission said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is worth mentioning one change which would assist authorities in their current collection arrangements and therefore, indirectly, facilitate the introduction of the council tax."</p></blockquote>
That is not an unfriendly remark about the council tax; the Audit Commission is supportive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a memorandum in March 1991, the Child Poverty Action Group said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The strong reluctance to make this change (the immediate restoration of 100 per cent rebates) stems from the principle underlying the poll tax that everyone should make a financial contribution to local services. We believe this argument is flawed on both principled and pragmatic grounds."</p></blockquote>
I agree wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) referred to the press conference on council tax benefits held by the Minister of State on 28 November. The Minister seemed to maintain the view that it would be appropriate to wait and to introduce all the changes at the same time under the new system. He seemed to argue that as long as the shelf life of the poll
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
tax continued, the principle that everyone must pay something should hold fast as if it was irrevocably wedded to the principle of the poll tax. I hope that he does not believe that. Working out the incomes and benefits system is different from working out whether we should call the tax a property tax or a personal tax, or a combination of the two. The Minister's argument will not hold good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thousands of poor poll tax payers cannot make the 20 per cent contribution without a reduction in their income. In practice, paying that 20 per cent pushes them further into debt elsewhere and they are burdened with multiple debts, albeit for small amounts, that they then have to carry for years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite a practical example. Let us consider the case of a long-term sick person, who receives £52.10 in income support and disability premium. She has deductions for fuel charges of £18.70 and deductions for a social fund loan of £3.67. She is left with £29.73 per week on which to live, out of which she is expected to pay £2 community charge. She may not pay her community charge, in the hope that the council will obtain a liability order and apply to the Department of Social Security for direct deductions, too, to get out of the trap. Surely that cannot be the way in which to proceed; it is forcing people into more poverty and is rendering them unable to pay the 20 per cent contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading of the Community Charges (General Reduction) Bill, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Dr. Hampson) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"About 70 per cent of defaulters are those who are supposed to pay 20 per cent."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 March 1991; Vol. 188, c. 858.]</p></blockquote>
If that is so, we can wipe out the debt. We must not compound it by building it into next year's debt. I hope that the Government can see the sense of removing the 20 per cent contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that they have, more or less, compensated income support claimants for that 20 per cent. However, the amount included in the benefit rates did not cover the claimants' poll tax liability, because the compensation was based on a comparison between the estimated average national rates and the poll tax bills, rather than the actual poll tax bills. That refers precisely to the point made by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) in his intervention. If the compensation were not related to the actual rate, it could prove to be insufficient. Since 1988, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside mentioned, means-tested benefits, including rebates, have been uprated only by the so-called Rossi index, which is the retail price index minus housing costs. As poll tax is included in the housing costs, the benefit rates have not, in practice, reflected the rise in poll tax levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Government have seen the light and recognised the need to abolish that 20 per cent (council tax) contribution for those on income support. They have recognised also that benefit rates should not be reduced to take account of the liability when the 20 per cent contribution ends. In reply to a parliamentary question that was tabled in March, the Government said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no specific amount for the community charge in any one individual's benefit."</p></blockquote>
They said that the compensation
	<br><blockquote><p>"now forms an integral part of overall rates."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 March 1991; Vol. 188, c. 448.]</p></blockquote>
Since the introduction of the reduction scheme, many claimants have had to commit that 20 per cent to pay other bills. In other words, they have not been compensated by the amount of income support that they receive. When Conservative Members suggested that there was no problem because the money was met by income support, they were wrong. The benefit did not relate to the actual bills. I hope that the Government bear that in mind when they refer to the relationship between the poll tax and the 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The benefit does not relate to the actual amount if the actual amount of the poll tax is set by an overspending council and is, therefore, an above-target community charge. As long as the rate is at or below the target, the 20 per cent element in the income support will cover it. Surely the problems to which the hon. Gentleman refers start when councils set a community charge that is above the target. I hope that he will join me in urging councils that have previously been high spenders to take that into account when they set their community charge for the coming year. Overcharging most hurts people on income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman elides overcharging and higher level. It is not true that all local authorities who had a higher poll tax were capped, because different figures are agreed for different areas. That is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume an average net poll tax of £210 for the financial year 1991–92. That would provide winners and losers when comparing liability for the 20 per cent contribution with compensation, because there would be an average loss of 9p for single under 25-year-olds, 8p a week for other single adults and an average cost of 18p a week for couples. People on benefit, living in areas where the poll tax is higher— it does not necessarily mean that the authority has been poll tax capped—will suffer loss of income and perhaps be unable to pay other bills. In other words, they will suffer a net reduction in income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend remind the hon. Member for Battersea that included in the income support level is a fixed amount for heating costs? However, no one can say exactly what the cost will be at a given time. Invariably, those in rented properties, and sometimes owner-occupiers, cannot afford the capital required to insulate their homes. Thus their heating costs are very expensive and there is energy poverty. People's first priority is to keep warm, so they do not pay their poll tax if insufficient money is allowed for heating, which is a fixed amount in income support, as is the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, which goes wider than the scope of his debate.
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
It is difficult accurately to identify the different elements of income support. There have been attempts to discover how much is included for food, clothing, water and heating. Heating is interesting: the figure is said to be notional, but it has no basis in reality. When the amounts allowed for each basic need are added together, the total is not enough to meet people's overall needs. That is what has happened in relation to the 20 per cent, contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have identified one element of income support: water charges. They accept that after privatisation claimants would have to meet rapidly rising water charges and that extra need was recognised by the Secretary of State for Social Security in a recent statement on uprating of benefit. He said that future benefit upratings would include an average increase in the cost of water. That was most unusual and it is interesting that water was singled out. The average increase in the cost of water relates to the comments made by Conservative members, because there are different rates in different parts of the country. Sadly, the water rate in Yorkshire is damned high, so compensation for the high percentage increase is automatically reduced. If the amount included does not cover the cost, it is a wasted exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not continue my argument that income support means providing assistance to people on low incomes. The argument that people should have enough money to pay their bills should be supported by increasing their income support level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Powerful economic arguments can be deployed on this issue. The Government used to love the phrase, "prudent housekeeping"—the shopping basket approach to good economic management. It has to be good economic management and common sense to abolish the 20 per cent contribution and return immediately to the system providing 100 per cent rebates. In its report entitled "The Administration of the Community Charge—Some Longer Term Considerations" the Audit Commission said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"exempting 20 per cent payers would more than pay for itself and would ease pressure on the system, particularly in areas where collection is very difficult".</p></blockquote>
The average collection cost per charge payer is £15. For those who contribute only through the 80 per cent relief arrangements, it is £6. The mathematics suggest that it is worth drawing a line under the system in this financial year and, as a way of easing in the council tax—to use the Audit Commission's words—to go for the 100 per cent rebate now. We can set the benefit system back on an even keel and row about that in other Committees with Ministers from other Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let us at least get the debate back to financing local government and not confuse it with subsidising or taking away from the income support system. To return to the intervention of the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson), I accept that there has been a shift from universal benefits to means testing. We can have that argument elsewhere, but to try to combine the two under the same benefit has made a total nonsense of the system. People who are poor have had to pay the price for this experiment in confusing the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>
environmental systems of the poll tax and the benefits system because of the changes to income support and the insistence on a 20 per cent contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should look carefully at the fair rates system, because at the heart of that is a declaration that one of the purposes of creating a fair rates system in the immensely complex way proposed is that it would inevitably lend itself to merging the tax and benefits systems completely. The hon. Gentleman should look very carefully at the beam in his own eye before he looks at a speck of dust in someone else's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Lady says. The relationship between the tax and benefits system is something in which I am deeply interested. However, nowhere in the document is it suggested that universal benefits and means-tested benefits should be blended within the same individual benefit. Individuals will receive different benefits: some will receive child benefit, which is universal, as well as income support. That happens, but not in the same benefit. The confusion arises because the Government have insisted that everyone must pay the price, regardless of their inability to pay. That was the most blinkered ideological move that the Government have embarked on and it caused one of the greatest injustices of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating the new council tax and the ratios of the banding, but it was a gross injustice that even poor people must pay the price of the poll tax experiment. I hope that the Government have the heart to draw a line under the whole episode and clear up the collection problems next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will inevitably be problems next year which will be on the same scale as this year's problems because of the retention of the 20 per cent rule. I hope that the Minister will assure us, because I understand that we cannot move, debate or vote on an amendment tonight, that the Government will bring forward an amendment so we need not vote on it on the Floor of the House on Report or Third Reading. Instead, the Government could concede the point, which has the support even of Conservative Back-Benchers, that the 20 per cent rule should be abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad that this point has been acknowledged in principle. Why not make this change now instead of in two years and ensure, as the Government have conceded, that income support is not clawed back in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I correct the hon. Gentleman on one point?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall keep my contribution brief, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has set out the conflicts in the Government's nonsensical unwillingness to bring forward the introduction of 100 per cent council tax rebates extremely well. If the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and other Conservative Members believed that their arguments were economically and socially sound they would favour retaining the 20 per cent element in the council tax. However, experience has shown them that the introduction of the 20 per cent contribution was one of the primary causes of the failure of the poll tax. That major flaw sounded the poll tax's death knell as soon as its principle was agreed. The poll tax may have survived if from the outset there had been arrangements for 100 per cent rebates, but that is history. Does the hon. Member for Battersea wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up the hon. Gentleman's invitation and make a few points. We have been over the introduction of the 20 per cent contribution many times, but a 100 per cent rebate would have meant that the 20 per cent element incorporated in the income support system would have been unnecessary. However, the incorporation of the 20 per cent element and the assurance that there will be no clawback mean that that element will remain in the income support system for all time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that argument and no Opposition Member would oppose it. We welcome the fact that the Government saw sense and accepted the logic of the arguments presented by Opposition Members and by groups such as the Child Poverty Action Group and the Citizens Advice Bureaux. Faced with that evidence, the Government realised that they could not replace the poll tax without rectifying the fundamental ideological error represented by the absence of a system of 100 per cent rebates. I assume that that conversion was necessary to ensure that the council tax would be up and running from day 1 without the millstone of the 20 per cent contribution around its neck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for an ideological argument about 100 per cent rebates. That argument has been won. Now that the principle of abolition of the 20 per cent element on 1 April 1993 has been conceded, we should discuss bringing that date forward to 1 April 1992. Such a concession would ensure consistency in the Government's conversion to 100 per cent rebates.

	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
It would also allow the council tax a chance of having a fair degree of public support when it is introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reasons for saying that are cynical. The last thing I want to do in the run-up to the election is to give the Government any public support on local government taxation, but as legislators we should be fair and honest. We must ensure that the Bill is successful, so it is in the Government's interests to accept the concept that on 1 April 1992 there will be 100 per cent rebates under the current poll tax legislation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West said, that makes sense in social, economic and administrative terms and also in terms of fairness. The arguments have been well rehearsed.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State has argued long and hard in Committee and outside that it is no part of local government to provide services that are inefficient and not cost effective. He cannot sustain that argument if the Government allows local government to pursue everyone who should pay 20 per cent of the tax: 70 per cent of defaulters are 20 per cent payers. Pursuing a defaulter results in a £9 loss to the Exchequer, so it makes no financial sense. The money could be spent improving the speedy introduction of the council tax or used to develop services. As the money involved is considerable, it would make sense to introduce the 100 per cent rebate from 1 April 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that local authorities are in the best possible position when the new tax is introduced. The Under-Secretary has not tried to mislead members of the Committee and I believe him when he says that he is doing all he can in his discussions with local authorities to ensure a smooth introduction of the council tax in regard to the regulations and the software. The hon. Gentleman is to be congratulated for making his best possible endeavours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Labour Members do not consider that that is going far enough. Increasingly, local authorities have to spend a great deal of their time and resources in collecting 20 per cent of the poll tax. Instead of spending resources on officer time, court time and associated administrative costs, local authorities should spend the money in ensuring that the new council tax is properly introduced. Anything else would be political and administrative folly. For those administrative reasons there is a sound argument for the Government dropping the 20 per cent liability from 1 April 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence of hardship does not come only from hard-bitten politicians in the Labour party, or not-so-hard-bitten politicians in the Liberal Democrat party. The most damning evidence of hardship comes from the citizens advice bureaux, the Child Poverty Action Group and others. Not even the most immune Conservative Members could doubt the plight of those people on income support who have had to pay the 20 per cent contribution. NACAB has sent us examples of the many injustices that it deals with daily. Hon. Members who serve on the Select Committee on Social Security have received extensive evidence in reply to one or two inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
Ministers have had a number of reports submitted to them by the NACAB and the CPAG. They are not party political organisations, but they are certainly political in defending the rights of people in the poorest sections of the community. Even the Ministers could not fail to be impressed by overwhelming evidence that the 20 per cent rule is working against those on the lowest levels of income in our society. On the grounds of fairness and the elimination of hardship, there are substantial reasons why 1 April 1992 should see the introduction of the 100 per cent arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that when my hon. Friends and I attempt to be reasonable we should not be believed because it is merely a political ploy to persuade him to adopt our position. We have heard the arguments about the poll tax and it is to go. Whoever claims credit for that, the final decision will be with the electorate. We have heard arguments about the 100 per cent arrangements for the council tax and the Government will clain credit for that because they proposed it. We are dealing with a narrow but significant issue that needs to be resolved and the Government can resolve it in a way that will bring them great credit from the public. Having heard all the arguments and having heard about the principles for a 100 per cent rebate, they should bring forward the date of its introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all that is asked of the Government. No one is asking them to make a great political climb down—they have done that already. The Government have been through the hoops and are not being asked to repeat that exercise; nor are they being asked to offload huge financial resources. They have made a statement about the Treasury arrangements for each of the Departments in the next financial year. The change will save the Government considerable resources. The net cost will be £9 per head in relation to the 20 per cent rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says "Nonsense". Like my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), I have felt more frustrated on this Committee than on any other of the many Committees that I have attended. However, I make no complaint about that. I feel frustrated because it can be demonstrated that there is a clear advantage for the Government in acting in a particular way. They have conceded the 100 per cent principle and our arguments have been reasonable. But even before a contribution is made from a sedentary position, a Minister will use colourful language to reject a concept in an offhand manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all the problems associated with the poll tax, the Minister does not feel chastened and will not apologise. He is arrogant. Good arguments have been made by Opposition Members and people outside the House for a system that saves on financial resources and administrative costs and deals with collection problems. The Government have an opportunity to show fairness in dealing with hardship, even at this stage of the Parliament, yet the Minister rejects all that out of hand and that is why I feel frustrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason I yelled "Nonsense" at the hon. Gentleman, for which I apologise, was that I was getting pretty frustrated when listening to him. As he is aware, we note down all the Labour party's pledges on extra spending. At times, we are amazed at the way in which Labour Members make pledges and then deny having made them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), I became aware of what is going on. Labour Members do not even know when they are making pledges and commitments to spend extra money. The hon. Gentleman said that there will be no cost next year in paying 100 per cent, of benefit to about 8 million community charge benefit claimants. Which planet is he living on? Of course there is a cost, and it will be about £440 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to argue for administrative simplicity or to say that it is a jolly good idea to pay benefit of 100 per cent, in the coming year, as shall do in 1993, but to claim that it does not cost anything is to depart from reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is clever at twisting words, even when we are trying to pick our way through a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that everything costs money; I am talking about negative costs or lower costs to the Government. That is the view not of a crazy Labour politician but of the Audit Commission, which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
Government established to advised them on how local government could achieve better financial prudence. I am supporting the views of the Audit Commission. If the Minister wants to repudiate the views of that body and suggest that it is on another planet, he should say so to it directly and not indirectly through me—I am thin skinned at the best of times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the right hon. Member for Brent, North (Sir Rhodes Boyson) who was once a fervent supporter of the poll tax and has reached his current position through experience and logic. Any Conservative Member who thinks through the issue logically must conclude that, in terms of administration, politics and cost, the opportunity for the Government to get out from under would be to use the date of 1 April 1992 and not 1 April 1993. If the Minister does not want to accept such advice, that is his lookout and he will doubtless pay the consequences at the general election. Between now and then, he should, for once, accept some sound advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
