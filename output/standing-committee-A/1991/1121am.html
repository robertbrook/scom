</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome back to our midst, Mr. Leadbitter. I am delighted to conclude last night's interesting debate on the liability of students to pay the new council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to a famous play by William Shakespeare when he said that it was not only the English, but also the Scots who were abed. That does not apply to the Welsh, since Henry V was a Welshman born at Monmouth, which was the scene of another famous victory not so long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, hon. Members referred to the cost of collecting the tax to local authorities that contain large educational institutions, universities or colleges, such as Manchester, Oxford, Cambridge and Cardiff. It is important to remember how much it costs to collect the very small sums of poll tax that are paid by students. In 1990–91, charge payers who received 80 per cent relief, contributed roughly £6 a year net to the public purse. The average collection cost per charge payer was about £15—approximately two and half times the net contribution. Why is it necessary to collect such small sums?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also yesterday, there was some discussion about the financial and economic state of students. This morning, every Welsh Member of Parliament received from the president of the National Union
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
of Students in Wales an invitation to attend a demonstration in Cardiff on 30 November. His letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As you are aware, students are facing greater hardship than ever before. Having barely survived a summer when they have lost entitlement to benefits and the vacation hardship allowance, they now face the academic year on a grant which, even with a loan, is way below subsistence level. Even entitlement to Housing Benefit has been removed.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>At a time when the Government is attempting"—</p></blockquote>
as we heard yesterday—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to increase the number of students in further and higher education, many students are faced with having to abandon their courses through poverty."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know from the experience of my 21-year-old daughter, who is a student, that all that my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) has just read the Committee is absolutely true of the situation of many students, but matters are even worse than that when hard-up students try to supplement their incomes by obtaining vacation employment, they find that they cannot because of the current high levels of unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that contribution. The amendment would ensure that students get a proper deal and that local authorities are properly compensated for the loss that they would incur if students were exempt from the council tax. I do not intend to press the amendment because the debate has been long and interesting. I hope that the Government will take note of what has been said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall now have a little read. That is important because I shall get my speech in 	<i>Hansard</i> and future readers of 	<i>Hansard</i> will know that I was in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further to the ruling by Sir Michael and me about the willingness of the Chairman to select starred amendments at afternoon sittings, the provisional selection list indicates those amendments which are starred on today's amendment paper. I remind the Committee that such an amendment will not be called if reached this morning. That does not, however, affect starred amendments in groups led by unstarred amendments. To be as helpful as we can to the Committee, we shall attempt to give maximum notice of our selection intentions. Inevitably, however, that means that selection for future days is rather tentative and is liable to change. That would be an excellent formula for approaching the European questions—it allows much flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would change the basis of liability from residence to occupation, in accordance with the General Rate Act 1967, which I consider to be significant in the implementation of any new tax, and in dealing with issues of recovery and insistence on payment. That Act embodies a wealth of case law that is used in pursuing liability for payment of local taxes. Until 1 April two years ago, local taxes had been raised by the rates for nigh on 300 years. Much administrative experience and information was gained from the procedures used for the levying and collection of rates. The General Rate Act 1967 provides the most efficient base for implementing a new tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 proposes that liability for payment of the new tax should be based on residence in, as opposed to occupation of, a property. Local authority treasurers and financial advisers to local authorities have argued strenuously against proposals based on residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax technical sub-group, which consists of officers of the Department of the Environment and representatives and officers of local government, was created to find the best way of introducing the new tax and making it work smoothly and efficiently. Those are the new sub-group's terms of reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax has caused problems because it is based on residence. Magistrates courts are overwhelmed with cases of non-payment brought by local authorities. In August this year, the Home Office issued a notice to local authorities and to the local magistrates courts advising on best practice in the use of bailiffs. The advice was issued because of the overwhelming problems created by the nonpayment of poll tax, of which there are pages of evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many cases have been brought before the valuation and community charge tribunals by people exercising their right of appeal, and conflicting decisions have been made. The tribunals are not law-making bodies and their decisions cannot be used in a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
There is a case on record of a poll tax payer in Bradford who challenged the community charge officer about the definition of the main place of residence. That is the only case that has come before the High Court and it leaves much to question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the history of how local government finance has been applied. The General Rate Act 1967 refers to occupation as the best way of helping local government with the introduction of new taxes. In the Bill, the Government propose that liability to pay the new tax be based on residence in the property, not on occupation of it. The Minister should seriously consider changing that proposal, as the amendment suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no definition of sole or main residence in the Bill, in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 or in previous legislation. The Bill does not state how "sole or main residence" should be interpreted; there is a void in that respect. That will create problems for local government officers who will have to administer the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday morning, at column 148, I raised the question of the inclusion of a garage in the residence. I asked whether, if a large double garage was not connected to the house, it would be included under the heading of "residence". The Minister replied in good faith and referred me to clause 3(6):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order amend, or substitute another definition for, any definition of 'dwelling' which is for the time being effective for the purposes of this Part."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that the Secretary of State could say that the double garage was a dwelling and would therefore be included in the provisions, but everyone would ridicule the idea that a double garage was a residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the work of the council tax technical sub-group which considered an identical issue. The sub-group says that, where a garage is separated from the dwelling by a sufficient distance, it should be regarded as a separate hereditament and would not give rise to the council tax on its own account. It would be for the valuation officer to determine whether a garage should be included in the hereditament and that decision would be subject to appeal. So the council tax technical sub-group says that it is a remote issue and would have to be clarified by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the General Rate Act 1967, that double garage would come under the term "occupation" and not "residence" and would not be interpreted as a place of residence as the Minister said yesterday. The sub-group set up by the Department of the Environment considered that matter and we should be fools not to take note of what the experts say. Whether the definition should be changed from "residence" to "occupation" should be considered in depth. The sub-group's report is interesting and the Minister should study it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No interpretation of the main residence was given in the Local Government Finance Act 1988. We cannot rely on case law because there are no cases to refer to, but I hope that reference can be made to cases brought to valuation tribunals. In a case before
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>261</span>
the High Court in Bradford, a seaman who lived in Bradford stated that he spent most of his time at sea and that therefore his main place of residence was not in Bradford, where he was being held liable for the poll tax, but at sea. He challenged the Bradford community charge registration officer on that issue. The case went to the local appeals tribunal which decided in favour of the seaman and against the community charge registration officer. The officer appealed to the High Court, which decided that a boat could not be described as a sole and main residence by somebody working on it. He was liable in the area where all his furniture and belongings were kept. The court overturned the decision of the local appeals tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>The Guardian</i> of 20 November 1991 refers to an interesting case which highlights my point. It refers to the return of Terry Waite and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The good news for Terry Waite is that he won't be coming home to a £465 poll tax bill, which is lucky. While he's been chained up in a cell, with nothing whatever to speak of in the way of amenities, civic or otherwise, he could still have been running up two-years' worth of outstanding community charge back home in Blackheath, London. In the case of Lewisham (his borough) that would amount to £297 last year and £168 this year. Britain's least-loved and most ludicrous tax gives a grudging break to those held in detention—who are thus unable to make many calls on, say, the local lending libraries or home help services. But that only applies to people detained in prison or hospital by virtue of an order of the courts. Those drafting the law dont't seem to have taken account of …"</p></blockquote>
a case such as Mr. Waite's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolute poppycock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does anyone challenge that story?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not believe everything he reads in 	<i>The Guardian.</i> Terry Waite was out of the country long before the introduction of the community charge. He would never even have been registered for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that when the form was sent to Terry Waite's home, he was not included on the register because he was not in the country and it was not his main or sole residence. Is he saying that people in that situation should not have been registered under the community charge registration scheme? It is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M Brandon-Bravo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that on reflection the hon. Gentleman will agree that Terry Waite is a well-respected person and that the House and the whole country rejoice that he is back. It is deplorable that his name and his situation is being dragged into a childish piece of party politics. The hon. Gentleman should be ashamed of himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman feels that way, why has he not taken the matter up with 	<i>The Guardian,</i> which published the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not bother to read 	<i>The Guardian.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Minister does not bother to read 	<i>The Guardian,</i> I suggest that publicly available knowledge can be used in a debate such as this. The last thing that I want to do is to say anything that would discredit Terry Waite. I am simply saying that the application of the poll tax is stupid and that this distinguished person could be caught by it unless we follow the lead of the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, who suggests that he should not register. To say that Terry Waite should not register is more damaging than the report in 	<i>The Guardian.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my doubts about the sincerity of Conservative Members? How many of them raised a finger to help Terry Waite get released?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members have touched on a sensitive point which I understand, but the more we persist on that subject the more we are away from the amendment. At the beginning, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) was quite in order, but the argument has pulled him a little out of order. The hon. Member is still in order if he wishes to persist with his example and relate it to the amendment, as he did at the beginning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used that example from 	<i>The Guardian</i> as an alternative to the court case in Bradford. I made the point that if we refer to the issue of residence, as it is in the Bill, as compared with occupation, the same problem will always arise and others will be caught up in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to have drawn the attention of members of the Committee to the problem. People had to register their sole place of residence under the community charge registration scheme. The seaman from Bradford spent days in the country and weeks out of the country but he had to be registered somewhere under the new scheme. He felt that he was not responsible for paying poll tax and went to the High Court, which found that he was responsible for paying poll tax even though he was not in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my constituents went to Australia last August on a working tour, but his family was sent a summons to pay the poll tax because his home was his main place of residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am making is that my constituent was out of the country in Australia and he was not using resources. The main point of the poll tax is as a means of paying for services, but the law says that a person is responsible for paying the tax because of his qualification of residence, not of occupancy. The Minister would be wise to consider residence compared with occupancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that we have not considered it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

recommendations and those of local government financial advisers. They suggest that we should consider the General Rate Act 1967, which is well tested and tried, to help local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to impress on Conservative Members the importance of this issue of residence and occupancy because the problem arises so often. Members of Parliament have a residence in London. Because of Committee work, we have to spend four or five days of the week here, and then travel back to our homes and families in our constituencies. The question is, which is our main place of residence? Under the Bill, the argument will be between the treasurers of the London boroughs where hon. Members stay and the treasurers in their constituencies as to who will get thebulk of the tax. Perhaps the Minister can say which is our main place of residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is entirely up to the community charge registration officers to decide among themselves. That is what the legislation says, and the best advice for Members of Parliament is to let their community charge registration officers decide. That is the virtue of the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would hon. Members apply under the Bill? Our residences in London would be part time—like a holiday or working home—but our main places of residence are in the constituencies. How would the charges be decided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly the same principle would apply; it will be up to the registration officers. The circumstances of individual Members of Parliament vary enormously. Some hon. Members have their main home in London and their children go to school in London; other hon. Members have different arrangements and some hon. Members are single. The virtue of the system is that each case is decided on its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That demonstrates how foolish the Bill is. I foresee that the chief financial officers of Bradford, Wakefield, Leeds or Sheffield will argue that theirs is the main place of residence of the Members of Parliament for those areas, but because we are spending four or five days a week in London, the treasurers of the London boroughs could argue that London was their main place of residence. How can that be resolved? Who will be the umpire? Is it the Secretary of State—we are told that he has those powers—or will it be the courts? The Minister is agreeing that the only way to resolve that question is through the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, through the tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should examine the cases that go to the tribunals. In one case a tribunal gave a decision in favour of the poll tax payer, yet the high court ruled against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can describe other cases; they could go on indefinitely. Where is the lead given in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is understandable that from time to time persistent attention to a particular argument can be projected in such a way that we move away from the amendment. The Chairman is completely defeated unless hon. Members make it clear that the words "resident" or "occupier" are in the amendment, because we are not considering the poll tax Bill—what the Conservative party would have called the community charge Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman wants to be awfully respectable this morning. It is important that hon. Members occasionally link their arguments—which both sides are pursuing legitimately—to the Bill, because 	<i>Hansard</i> will be read. The Chairman does not mind but the people who read 	<i>Hansard</i> will observe the extent to which we are wandering away from the main issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us talk about the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your guidance, Mr. Leadbitter, and will certainly talk about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill states that unoccupied furnished accommodation will be treated as if two people were living in that dwelling. I am sure that there is no disagreement between myself and the Minister on that issue. The council would serve a bill on the residence as if two people were living there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the liable person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come back to the question of Members of Parliament who live in London. An hon. Member who has a flat in London will be billed as though two people were living there. Obviously, if his family were to join him, it would be difficult to claim that a single person lived there. Likewise, in his constituency home he will be billed as though two people lived there. His sole residence must therefore be identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making heavy weather of that. In fact, under the Labour party's system there would be two sets of rates to pay; under the council tax there will be a 50 per cent reduction for one home in those circumstances. If there were any challenge about which home is secondary, the appeals procedure in clause 16 could be used. It is as simple as that. Why cannot the hon. Gentleman look at the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You advised us to look at the Bill, Mr. Leadbitter, but the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) first mentioned what the Labour party would do. If he wants to discuss the Labour party's policy, I am prepared to do so, but that would be contrary to your wishes, Mr. Leadbitter. I am anxious about such provisions. I raised the matter with the Minister last night. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If furnished accommodation is empty and the owner is billed for two amounts of tax, all he would

have to do is advise the local authority that two students live there to pay no tax on that property. Who will check such claims? The Minister says that the local authoriy will check. So the Bill will need an army, especially in London, Leeds, Bradford and other university towns, which does nothing other than check that exempt premises are registered correctly. That is not what local government is for, but it is what the Bill will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the accommodation to which I referred is occupied for a few days a week, the owner should pay only one and a half times the bill. Again, that would be open to abuse if there were no checks, because someone could take advantage of the Bill. However, if the occupier were served with a notice, that situation would not arise as he would be the responsible person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) that the hon. Gentleman is making heavy weather of the point. In fact, in local areas there are lists of students who are exempt from the council tax which can be matched easily with local authority lists of houses in which people have said that students are resident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to know who keeps the two lists. I understand that the local authority will have a list, but someone has to compile and check it. Who will keep the other list to which the hon. Gentleman referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last night we discussed at great length the way in which universities will need to have lists of students who live locally, otherwise there will be no way to grant exemptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The list that universities will have will be of students living in halls of residence. I cannot understand how we could ask universities to keep a list of students who live in bedsits or who own flats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the Bill, Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Halls of residence are referred to in the Bill. Last night one of my colleagues raised this important issue. It is all right for hon. Members to say that we are making heavy weather of the matter, but we do so in the interests of local government. I want to ensure that the application of any such legislation is in the best interests of local government. I labour the point because I believe that Conservative Members are unaware of the implications of the Bill, and of clause 6 in particular. It will affect how the tax will be collected and who will be responsible for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee further declarations being made by the Home Office because the courts will again be clogged with people who are in doubt as to whether they are responsible for collecting the tax—as they were when the poll tax was introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery over his point about students. Students will have to be certificated and that point was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
discussed at length yesterday, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will recall if he jogs his memory. It is clear that if students are certificated and people claim that two students are living with them, it will be a simple matter for a local authority to check, if it so wishes, during the normal course of policing operations which local authorities have undertaken for many years under various systems of local government taxation. This is a non-problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are the various systems to which I was referring under section 16 of the General Rate Act 1967. Local authorities were working to such systems up to 31 March last year. Then they were changed and we have seen the chaos that resulted. Under the proposed legislation, that chaos will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have an opportunity to change the system to ensure that local authorities will not be railroaded into circumstances identical to those that occurred following the Local Government Finance Act 1988. The amendments are relevant and constructive and they should be accepted by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall demonstrate what happened to one of my constituents under the poll tax. The same problem that that person now experiences would continue under the proposed council tax and the residence qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituent is a profoundly deaf student who wished to pursue a university course followed by vocational training. The only university that could provide that is in the United States of America. He is now a full-time student there and he received a bursary from charities to allow him to attend the course, which he was doing before registration was required under the poll tax legislation. He was required to register, but he was denied status as a student and eligibility for the 80 per cent rebate because he was studying outside the United Kingdom. He was told that his home in a modest little house in my constituency, which was empty and to which he returned for only two weeks at Christmas to be with his family, was liable for the standard charge because the poll tax registration officer, under guidance from current legislation, deemed that his first residence was the hall of residence at the university in America. His second residence was deemed to be in his home in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For two years, a standard charge has been levied on him. He is a student but he is denied that status because he is outside the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right in saying that it is entirely up to the local council to levy the standard charge within a particular group? It cannot therefore be the Government's responsibility. It is for the local authority to decide whether it will levy two charges as the standard charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

have to act as the Government want them to act. The matter will be settled by an appeal by my constituent, which I presume will act as a test case nationally for similar situations. I can tell the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) that the Royal National Institute for the Deaf has experienced the same difficulty. The problem is not unique, in that local authorities have adopted the same interpretation in accordance with the requirements of the regulations. The result is that a person can be denied the status of a student because he is outside the United Kingdom, even though it would be impossible to pursue a course from outside the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to develop this point. It is difficult to keep to the amendment, as I am using the case as an illustration in the argument between occupation and residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RNID has confirmed that my constituent, whom it has helped to support, is a full-time student. His status as a full-time student in halls of residence has also been confirmed by the university in America. The charities that provide his bursaries also confirm that he is a full-time student, yet both the poll tax legislation and the council tax proposals deny his status as a student. So what is to happen with his house in Britain? The residence regulations clearly mean that my constituent should not be liable to pay anything as he is not resident in the house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady think that my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) is right to suggest that this is a matter for the local authority's discretion? The Government regulations require only that there should be no discrimination between people in the same category. It would be perfectly possible for Bristol county council to levy a zero charge—or half, or whatever proportion it wished—for such categories of foreign students. Will the hon. Lady also say what would happen to her constituent under the rating system, to which she and her party are pledged to return? A rate would be levied on the house in which he resides, yet I presume that, as an overseas citizen, her constituent would not be eligible to claim housing benefit to help to meet that charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) was pursuing a particular line on the amendment, but I suspect that the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis), being a good parliamentarian, was doing a spot of fishing with a view to tempting the hon. Lady into discussing the rating system. I hope that she will resist that temptation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Leadbitter, I was so tempted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suffice it to say that the correctness of the local authority's ruling in this case has been checked. Like all other members of the Committee, I am a busy and dedicated Member of Parliament, and I did my best to sort out my constituent's problem with as little bureaucracy and as much speed as possible. My
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
constituent is a student in America who cannot afford to travel back to Britain. His mother, who is representing him, is also profoundly deaf and can only communicate with other people via a signer. The logistics of the tribunal would be difficiult. I have done my best. We have checked and double-checked the current regulations and the matter must be resolved by an appeal. That is regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, my constituent would not count as resident in his property and so would not be liable for the tax. Irrespective of the other anomalies—whether he is a student, whether it counts that he is such in the United Kingdom or elsewhere—the residency qualification would automatically correct the difficulty with the least aggravation possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituent's problem arose because he leaves his property empty and returns only for short periods, such as two weeks at Christmas. He will continue to do so for the next three years. Legislation cannot be drafted on the basis of odd people whose circumstances are outside its normal requirements, but it should be possible to sweep up those people within the Bill. The residency qualification would achieve that and would help my constituent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After reading the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> this morning, I am wary of speaking. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) is not present but the headline reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"English Tory launches bitter attack on 'Whingeing Scots'".</p></blockquote>
I am worried about speaking lest I be accused of being a whingeing Scot, even with my nice Oxford accent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oxford accent—not necessarily "nice".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock misunderstands our point. I wish that he and his hon. Friends had the courage of their convictions about Scotland. If they believe that there should not be separate Scottish legislation they should abolish the Scottish Office and do away with the Secretary of State for Scotland and his Parliamentary Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). How many Tory Members would be returned at the next election after that? There will be few enough anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the amendments relate to Scotland. They are probing amendments which remove the word "resident" and insert "occupier". I am sorry that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "resident" is new in Scottish local government finance legislation. Why has it been included in the Scottish part of the Bill? Is it to keep Scotland in line with England? Perhaps my suspicions about the abolition of the Scottish Office are right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: John Steinbeck was not a scholar, but a popular author. He was talking not about spellings, but about the different ways that the English language is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making a political point but simply asking the Minister to explain why the word "resident" is in the Scottish provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important and, at times, intriguing debate. I will attempt to answer the serious points that have been raised as well as dealing with the principle behind the amendment and explaining why I hope that the Committee will not accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has introduced a Scottish dimension to our debates. It is very important and the hon. Gentleman has realised that there is a good opportunity for him to come along and put the Scottish case before the Committee. I welcome that very much. However, it is confusing for English Ministers, even if they have Scottish wives and their first job was in Scotland, to find on the Committee an Englishman representing Scottish constituents and two English constituencies being represented by Scotsmen. Nevertheless, that is a mark of the value of the Union, and long may it continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was born in Oxford—I do not deny it. But my mother was born in what is now my constituency and my father was the only member of his family of six who was not born there. If I had been born in China of Scottish parents, I do not think that I would have been Chinese.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must not be tempted too far down that path, Mr. Leadbitter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Bristol, West—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The Secretary of State for Health is—at the moment—the Member of Parliament representing Bristol, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo). The hon. Lady's problem would not be solved by a reference to residence. If a dwelling has no resident, the owner is liable. Therefore, unoccupied property belonging to students will be exempt from the council tax. The question still turns on whether the individual is a student, not on residence. I understand that under the council tax it is likely that the hon. Lady's constituent will be regarded as a student. What matters is the sort of institution at which he is a student. I am in no position to judge that, particularly not during the passage of a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the Bill will exempt all zero-rated categories under the present system. I hope that that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
will help the hon. Lady to determine her constituent's case, but without knowing more details, it is impossible for me to perform the function of a tribunal or a court of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister help me on this point because it is very important to my constituent? If I send the Minister the details of the case, because I would rather avoid an appeal to the valuations officer, will the hon. Gentleman give guidance on it? As I understand it, the definition of "student" for the purpose of exemption will be the same under the council tax as it was under the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition covers full-time students at foreign universities. However, I cannot pursue this case with the hon. Lady; it must go through the usual procedures of the tribunal and, if necessary, beyond. That is the way that the system was set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can now make some progress. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) spoke of the work of the council tax technical sub-group. Its work has been very valuable and I pay tribute to the members of the group, both those from the local authorities and my own officials. It will continue to meet throughout the implementation period of the council tax and it will make a valuable contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton says that local authorities want the term "occupation". But they recognise that the concept would have to be modified to cover some cases where it would not be appropriate to bill the occupier but where the resident should be billed. However, why should we start with the wrong basis and modify it, rather than start with the basis which we want, which is residence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to section 16 of the General Rate Act 1967 which covers occupancy. I see no reason why the principle of that section could not apply under the Bill. If there is a reason, could the Minister explain it to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is still being discussed by the technical sub-group. I will not pre-empt its discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to explain the principle that we are trying to achieve. I am also still trying to answer some of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised, such as that about the work of magistrates courts. I pay an unreserved tribute to the work of magistrates courts up and down the country. They have been working very hard on the community charge. Many local authorities have gone to great lengths to try to reach settlements before the magistrates courts are involved. Many arrangements have been made and much counselling has been given; and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will have visited the magistrates courts in his constituency, as I have done in mine, to see how magistrates, local authorities and charge payers are coping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not dwell on this point, Mr. Leadbitter, lest you point out that we are meant to be considering the council tax of the future, rather than the community charge of the present. However, I should like to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>271</span>
correct the impression given by the hon. Member for Normanton that the bailiffs are somehow to blame for problems that have arisen. I pay tribute to the way in which the ancient tradition of the bailiffs has helped many local authorities. Bailiffs are the last people to be caricatured as the bad party in this business. They have been extremely responsible. They have worked with representatives of the local authority associations and have consulted on a voluntary code. They could not have been more positive. We must also remember that the bailiffs' involvement with the community charge is only a tiny part of their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the point that I made on Second Reading, when I quoted the anxiety of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux about the use of private bailiffs? The association said that there had been evidence of abuse by private bailiffs and called for a system of bailiffs under public control in the collection of the poll tax and other local taxes. Why does the Minister reject that advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not rejected that advice. I have not considered it, because I have not heard a proposal that there should be a nationalised bailiffs association. I am not sure that I would find such a proposal attractive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal was made in-house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it was made in-house, but the best local authorities go to enormous lengths to ensure that taxes are collected sensibly and humanely. It is sad that the exceptions and bad apples are always used to represent the generality of bailiffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to the work of the valuation and community charge tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not discredit the bailiffs. I said that the Home Office had sent guidance notes to courts setting out how bailiffs should operate in the courts. I was quoting from a statement, now in 	<i>Hansard,</i> issued by the Home Office. Under previous legislation the Home Office needed to send out guidance notes and the same will happen under this legislation. The amendments would prevent that. Although I do not always agree with the way in which some of them operate, I am not discrediting bailiffs. All I am saying is that there would be little use for them if section 16 of the General Rate Act 1967 were applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that the courts accredit a particular bailiff. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to suggest that the courts are wrong in their choice of bailiffs. I said that I pay tribute to the VCCTs. The hon. Gentleman was confused by the difference between appeals on liability to pay the tax and cases of people who wilfully refuse to pay the tax. It is important to reinforce that crucial distinction.

Let me return again to the question of the garage over 25 sq. m. being subject to the council tax. When
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
they are separate from other larger properties and used only for private garaging, such premises are subject to the tax. The line must be drawn somewhere and so we have drawn it as it appeared in the 1988 Act. Garages with a floor area of more than 25 sq. m. will often be commercial premises and so will be subject to business rates. The issue is a bit of a red herring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To me, please. Let me ask a question about garages—I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) will have a slightly different one. It is clear that the garage, wherever it may be, is part of the property of the house and is bought and sold with that house. However, what would happen if someone has a house without a garage and buys a garage elsewhere? Would that be included as part of the house or considered separately, whatever its size?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that would be for the local tribunal to decide if the rating officer makes a decision that is unacceptable to the person liable to pay the tax. I know that the garages of many people, particularly in urban areas, are a long way from their residences. However, I suspect that those garages are often rented separately as a commercial enterprise and in those circumstances it is possible that they may be business-rated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be making progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause means that a person will be charged as a resident. The amendment would charge not the resident, but the occupier, as under the 1967 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The person would come into the system for charging purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the person can come into the system only as a resident. It is ridiculous to suggest that a person is a resident of a garage, but he or she could be called an occupier. That is the principle of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not charging separate garages. If the garage is part of the hereditament, that is how it will be taxed.

The Bradford court judgment to which the hon. Gentleman referred was very helpful. It is not true to say that there is no case law on the community charge; this case has cleared up the position of people who spend time away from home. We took a long time considering this matter last winter, during the Gulf war. We had to consider the cases of service men who fought in the war; auxiliaries who worked alongside the Royal Navy; contractors who worked

on Royal Air Force planes in Saudi Arabia. We also had to consider the case of hostages, not only those who had been incarcerated for as long as Terry Waite but others who were caught in a plane that landed at the airport at the wrong moment. Terry Waite's case was rightly, a matter of the local authority. It is for them to decide whether he is laible for tax for the past two years. No outstanding litigation, controversy or appeal exists. News, wherever it is reported, is irrelevant to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rates were a tax on the occupation of property. In many, but not all cases, the occupier and the resident was the same person. Charities were deemed to be the occupiers of property used for charitable purposes. In what the law describes as the master and servant circumstance, where an employee was provided with accommodation for the better performance of his duties, the employer was described as the occupier. The council tax is based on the straightforward concept of residence, which is less arcane than that of occupation. Residence is easily understood. It is reflected in the bill that applies to a dwelling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about tied farm cottages? In Scotland, farmers were responsible for paying the rates on their tied cottages. Under the poll tax regime, the farm worker was responsible. Who will be responsible for paying the council tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is abundantly clear. The council tax is a tax on residence. The resident is liable to pay the tax. Half the tax is based on property and the other half on a personal element. The hon. Member for Cathcart raised a point about residence in Scotland. There is no difference between the English, Welsh and Scottish provisions on residence in the Bill. The community charge was based on residence in the three countries. It is not a new concept.

The amendments seek to change the basis of liability for the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned service men in the Gulf war. Will he clarify the position of service men, merchant seamen and fishermen who are not resident in their homes, sometimes for months? How will the council tax affect them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been one of my duties to liaise closely with hon. Friends who are Ministers in the Ministry of Defence. I also represent a highly militarised constituency. Service men and their families are in a unique position. They have little say about where they live. They are frequently posted from area to area. They usually face common accommodation charges. We propose to make special arrangements that will recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Service men in barracks and married quarters will not be directly liable for the council tax. The Ministry of Defence, as the owners, will contribute to the local authority. The Ministry of Defence will pass on the bills through accommodation charges, which will be set at uniform levels throughout the country, related to the sort of accommodation occupied. It is a return to the arrangements that worked so well under the rates system. I pay tribute to the members of the subgroup who have pursued that course over many months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I pay tribute to my hon. Friend. The anomaly under the old system was that two people in identical quarters, serving in the same unit, living only a few hundred yards apart, might pay different amounts because they lived on opposite sides of a boundary. Such people would probably not have voted in the local election because they would usually be on a short-term posting of, typically, two years and so would have had no say in choosing the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has played a leading role in fighting for the rights and interests of soldiers, and I pay tribute to him. The situation which I describe would be covered by Crown immunity, not statute. Service personnel who live in their own accommodation come under clause 8. They will be liable for council tax in the normal way. To provide otherwise might be considered unfair by neighbouring residents who use the same local services. However, under our general council tax proposals, there will be a 25 per cent discount for properties with only one adult resident, such as a service man's wife living alone, and 50 per cent discount for properties that are no one's main residence. That will be of great benefit to service men and their families and I hope that it will be seen to be fair and reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Service men will be pleased with that change. It is welcome, provided that the Ministry of Defence pays the bills so that local authorities do not lose out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister have further discussions with the Ministry of Defence to consider transitional arrangements? The Ministry of Defence is about to dispose of 40,000 service men. Many of them will lose their homes, despite the Ministry having about 10,000 empty homes. Those service men will not only lose their homes but become liable for the council tax. The Ministry of Defence should pay to cushion the blow to such people as they leave the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are continuing discussions between my Department and the Ministry of Defence.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on merchant seamen?

The interpretation of sole and main residence for merchant seamen in Scotland has caused difficulties in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to the Anderton case, to which I shall return. First, I shall finish with the principle which I was discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax is not a tax on the beneficial occupation of property. In most cases, it is a tax on residence and bills reflect the number of residents. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>275</span>
would be odd if liability were based on something else. If it were based on occupation, it would be possible for the occupier not to be resident. In such cases, it would be difficult for local authorities to trace the person liable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to make life more difficult for local authorities. Where there is no resident, we propose that the owner should be liable. Authorities will have to identify the owner of the property. That will be no more difficult than it was under the rates, where the owner of unoccupied property was liable. It is no different from the situation that would arise if the fair rates system, perish the thought, were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals provide local authorities with the easiest means of assessing liability. We have set out clearly the order in which liability is to be assessed. It will be the owner-occupier or the tenant when people live in the property, and the owner of the property when there is no resident. Everyone understands the question, "Where do you live?" but I doubt whether many people would readily know whether they were beneficial occupiers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Cathcart referred to merchant seamen. I must advise him that, following the Anderton judgment, the law is now clear in England.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The Anderton judgment was about habitual residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is also unreasonable of him to suggest that there can be no other cases. There are many other cases dealing with habitual residence. To give me an opportunity to consider those, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former seaman, I have a question. In my experience, many seamen do not have a habitual residence of the kind described by the Under-Secretary. They live at sea for almost all their lives. They may stay in a seaman's mission or some other residence that takes care of seafarers, but only for a few days—a week or 10 days at most—until they rejoin their ship. The case to which the hon. Gentleman referred does not clarify the situation of seamen. I have not read the whole judgment, but I understand that it should make it clear whether, in the eyes of the court, a ship is a habitual residence at a particular time. The court decided that a ship on the high seas could not be considered a habitual residence, but it failed to deal with the circumstances of seamen who live at sea habitually and come ashore for a short time, and whether they should be liable for the tax. The matter has not been resolved satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, as the hon. Gentleman says, a seaman has no residence, the position is clear. If, however, he has a habitual residence in a local authority area, that is also clear, following the judgment. I wonder to which local authority the hon. Gentleman would assign various ships floating on the high seas. That is not a sensible line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said, and no doubt will have to repeat, that the council tax is not the rates or the community charge. It is, therefore, not appropriate to use the same criterion as the basis for liability. Whatever the basis, councils will still have to take a view on residence in order to send out the correct bills. We have given them the most effective means of doing that, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great respect for the Minister and I am sorry that he has had to defend the indefensible. It is not only Opposition Members who are concerned about the issue of residence as opposed to occupancy. The important case referring to Anderton and the Bradford corporation is the only significant one in the body of case law. I feel sorry for the Under-Secretary if he is saying that that one example is a sufficient base for new legislation. There could be a challenge in another court, which might give a different decision. If that happens, what price this legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anderton spent three months at sea and one month at home. The community charge registration officer considered that his sole and main residence was his home. Anderton appealed to the valuation court, which decided that, because he spent three months on an Atlantic conveyer, that was his main residence. It therefore found in his favour. The local authority appealed to the High Court, which ruled that Anderton's main residence was his home, where his furniture was, thus overturning the valuation court's decision. That sort of argument will continue.

We should consider section 16 of the General Rate Act 1967. There have been many challenges, and legislation based on that kind of case law is much sounder than the proposals in the Bill.

The Under-Secretary and his colleagues are confused by the issue of the garage that is separate from a residence, as described by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). We were told that there would be a separate charge, but under the Bill the person in residence will be charged. Only a fool would say that a garage is occupied by residents. It is occupied, but not by residents. The Under-Secretary and his cohorts should be aware that such issues could make the Bill look ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that it would be difficult to trace the occupier of empty property. People have been tracing the owners of properties for nearly 300 years. Properties cannot move, but the people responsible for them have been traced to Canada and other places all around the world. Tracing residents will be the problem. The Government insist on the term "resident" because that is the poll tax part of the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the debate that this issue is more important than many hon. Members, including me, realised. I make no bones about asking my hon. Friend to consider the effect of the residence provision, rather than beneficial occupation under the old property tax, when someone deliberately chooses to live in a hotel most of the time. A person may have left a residence which is not his second home but is his main place of beneficial occupation. In any normal valuation system, he would be charged on the basis of his beneficial occupation. Many Members of Parliament live in hotels down here in London rather than renting or buying accommodation. They have the beneficial occupation of substantial premises elsewhere. Such cases are crucial, notwithstanding the Bradford case which arose under the poll tax, which was a personal charge. The Bill is supposed to propose a property tax, not a personal charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A person who stays down here in an hotel for four days a week could argue that his residence in his constituency is not his main place of residence. If the treasurer is satisfied that that is not his main place of residence, he will be entitled to discount. The whole thing is a can of worms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would be nonsence to deem someone's main residence as on board a ship. However, for the purposes of the tax the Government have deemed boats to be main residences—there are regulations about that. Surely a definition has to be based on the precise length of time a person spends on board ship. In fact, some British seamen—fewer than two or three years ago—spend their entire lives on board ship, and have no permanent residence in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

has been to court—that is an insufficient basis for the proposals.

The Minister referred to my comments about Terry Waite. The local authority decided not to serve Terry Waite his poll tax bill only because it classed his main place of residence as the place where he was being held. That was the reason given, and it shows how foolish the proposals are. When we tabled the amendments we did not intend to press them to a vote. However, as a result of our discussions, I feel that I cannot withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an important debate which provided an interesting example of how the Government are likely to get themselves into difficulties—their new and untried tax will take us into uncharted territory. Their anxiety to produce a tax that is neither the poll tax nor not the poll tax has forced them into all sorts of curious hybrids. The difficulties they experienced with the concept of residence provided evidence of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on these amendments will produce an equivalent problem for the Government. They deal with joint and several liability, which is established under clause 6(3), and provides that a joint occupant can be held liable for any arrears of council tax. Such a provision also applies under the poll tax. Under the poll tax a spouse or cohabitee can be pursued if the partner fails to pay his or her poll tax. The concept of joint and several liability is to be retained under the council tax, and indeed will be extended to other categories of joint occupants who might be liable to pay the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Joint and several liability under the poll tax caused a great deal of anger and difficulty. It was especially abhorrent in the case of elderly pensioner couples where the husband had a pension income but the wife—who was also retired and of pensionable age—had no income. I received a letter from such a husband, outlining the problem. In those circumstances, the husband was likely to be willing to pay his own poll tax—even though the individual poll tax bill was higher than the household rates bill, but he could not understand why he was also liable to pay the poll tax for his wife, who had no means of paying it and was obliged under the law to look to him to pay it. That was most unfair. The system not only bore heavily on many people in such situations—it contradicted the whole principle of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
It was an example of the Government, having proclaimed that the virtue of the poll tax was that it was a head tax, whereby everyone would be accountable for the services that he or she enjoyed—and that sort of rubbish—promptly standing on their heads and saying that in such a case it was not a question of personal liability but simply of getting the money out of the household. That was why joint and several liability caused great difficulty both to those who suffered under it and, I suspect, to the Government who had to pursue it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation under the rating system was rather different. As the Secretary of State for the Environment has himself persuasively put it on several occasions, the rates were habitually regarded as a household bill, like the gas or the electricity bill; arrangements to pay it were informally made within a household. That gives the lie to another favourite nostrum of those who always supported the poll tax—that, under the rates, few people contributed to the services that they enjoyed. Case law, as it were, was therefore created suggesting that the liability for the bill could be joint and several in certain circumstances; however, even then much discretion rested with the local authority, which by and large, did not exercise it in such cases as that of a wife whose husband has left her and who is alone in a property, and who discovers that her husband has also left a large unpaid rates bill. In such circumstances, most local authorities would have been prepared to draw a line under that bill and open a new account for the wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax demonstrates a curious hybridity—it is neither a property tax nor a head tax, but a bit of both. Again, the Government cannot seem to make up their minds which of those conflicting principles should apply to the hybrid monster that they have created. They have opted for the illogical poll tax principle of joint and several liability and they are going to extend it, not just to spouses or cohabitees but to people who live in the same property or who are liable under the same "head". Their logic is curious. If the council tax is to be regarded as a property tax, on all fours with the rates, the application of joint and several liability is comprehensible, because that would flow from the council tax bill being a household bill. However, according to Ministers that is not the story. No; so as to maintain its poll tax credentials and to make its poll tax origins apparent, we are assured—not least by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who is looking so blank and puzzled—that the council tax is not just a property tax, but 50 per cent a head tax—or, to use the Scottish Under-Secretary's preferred expression, a personal tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

So it is difficult to see why there should be joint and several liability for that element of the bill. That is the same illogicality as applied to the poll tax. One can understand why Ministers quail at

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>281</span>
the prospect of dividing the bill, saying that 50 per cent of it is a household bill—the property tax element—and the other 50 per cent of it a personal bill. Thus, if a husband leaves his wife, she will not be responsible for 25 per cent of the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is all very complicated. I understand why even Ministers, with their great capacity for inventing the most complicated systems, may jib at introducing such complexities. That is why they have gone for a totally illogical compromise—to whack on, right across the board and with no regard for logic or equity, the principle of joint and several liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is achieved by specific provisions in clauses 6 and 9, to which amendments Nos. 122 and 124 relate. Clause 6 states that any resident who occupies the premises on the same terms as the liable person will be jointly and severally liable. That would apply if the person was a joint tenant, leaseholder or freeholder with the liable person. Clause 9 proposes that spouses and cohabitees will also be jointly and severally liable for arrears of council tax relating to period when they were living with their partner and their partner was responsible for the bill. In some circumstances it might seem perfectly reasonable to expect adults who live together and who share responsibility for household bills to be required to share responsibility for this bill. But quite apart from its illogicality, the principle of joint and several liability sometimes has extremely deleterious practical consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments identify some such examples. Interestingly, those examples are recognised by the Government, although for a slightly different purpose. The poll tax legislation recognised certain categories of people, such as prisoners and those who were classed as severely mentally infirm, who should be exempt from the personal charge. Characteristically, however, those same people could still be held liable for their partners' arrears. That crazy system caused great difficulties. Incredibly, that anomaly has been continued in the council tax legislation. Those who were exempt from the poll tax will be, to use the Minister's expression, invisible. For the purposes of discounts under the council tax, however, they can still be held liable under the joint and several liability rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot be unaware of that problem. In its practice note, which was discussed with the local authority associations, the Department of Environment advised against recovery from those who are themselves exempt from the poll tax. The practice note states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in theory, joint and several liability would also apply if either the husband or the wife were exempt—though in practice it seems unlikely"—</p></blockquote>
a hopeful phrase—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that charging authorities would wish to use the powers in those circumstances".</p></blockquote>
Why does not the Department of the Environment have the courage to put the matter beyond doubt in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments attempt to make good that deficiency and to make up for the Government's lack of bravery, resolution and clarity. We propose that if a person is disregarded under paragraphs 1, 2 and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
4 of schedule 1 for the purpose of the discount, he should not be liable for arrears of council tax under the principal of joint and several liability. That would exempt people who are detained, as described in paragraph 1. It would also exempt from joint and several liability severely mentally impaired people, under paragraph 2, and—this returns us to our old favourite category—students, defined under paragraph 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that Ministers really want the legislation to result in a severely mentally impaired person—I do not wish to be too detailed, but a moment's reflection may conjure up an image of such a person—being held responsible for the bill of another person. That cannot be the Government's intention, but that is what the Bill provides. I urge Ministers to say whether that is their intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an even more interesting and bizarre consequence for students. In yesterday's debate, we heard a great deal about the invisibility of students. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) was extremely concerned about the love life of students. The Minister even speculated on whether their love life would be better or worse as a consequence of that invisibility. The current rules provide that a student, invisible as he or she might be, could be liable for the whole bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine a student who lived alone as the resident of a property and then agreed to share the accommodation with a non-student or a student who on a given day ceased to be a student. As I understand it, when the student lived alone the property would be exempt, but as soon as the non-student moved in, there would be a liability for 75 per cent of the bill applicable to those premises. If clause 6 applied and they were both in the same category—both tenants, both owners or both under licence—or if, under clause 9, they were sensitive to the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and became spouses or cohabitees, the student would become jointly and severally liable for 75 per cent bill. If the non-student departed because the love life had proved to be less satisfactory than was hoped—possibly because of the invisibility of the student in the first place—the student who had initially been entirely exempt would suddenly become solely liable for the 75 per cent bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An even more interesting situation could arise. If the student was the owner and resident of the premises, the premises would be exempt. But, if he or she took in a lodger who was not a student and who was lower down in the hierarchy of liability under clause 6, not only would that non-student bring on to the dwelling the 75 per cent liability, but the student, higher up in the hierarchy, would be solely responsible. What an amazing disincentive to a student to take in lodgers. A 75 per cent bill would suddenly arrive and the student would suddenly discover that he or she was solely liable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only escape from that dilemma would be for the owner-resident student to be so attracted to the non-student lodger that they agreed to marry or to cohabit with each other. That could possibly be established by aerial photography. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Once that had been established the student owner-resident-landlord would be assured that he or she would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>283</span>
not solely responsible for the 75 per cent bill, but jointly and severally. I am sure that that would be a great comfort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules are a hotch-potch of confusion and illogicality. Considering all the changes in the status not only of the liable person but of others—that status may change from day to day and be impossible to establish without the most invasive intrusion into private lives—and all that will be required before local authorities can properly issue a bill, the mind boggles at the stupidity of Ministers even to suggest that such a system can work. Yet there is justice in that because the illogicality and confusion flow directly from the Government's cowardice in not being prepared to decide whether they are introducing a property or a head tax. It is because they will not decide that the Committee is in a hopeless mess. I look forward to hearing how the Minister proposes to extricate himself from that mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has hit the nail on the head. We are having this debate—one can envisage another such debate on clause 9—because the clause seems to have been taken from the poll tax legislation and dumped into the Bill without any thought about the difference between the council tax and the poll tax. Perhaps the council tax is not so different from the poll tax. Perhaps the Government have not decided whether they want a property tax or a poll tax, so they are taking parts of the poll tax legislation and putting it into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious worries about the phrase "jointly and severally liable". It is true that there are many houses and flats in joint ownership, but there are also millions of other houses and flats that are not. It is only fair that owners should be responsible for the payment of a property tax—not that we are in favour of a property tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause continues the unfairness of the poll tax and makes it difficult for local authorities to decide whether two or more people are severally liable. It is an extension of the snoopers charter because it will place a responsibility on local authorities to establish who is "jointly and severally liable". They will have to obtain information on whether a man and woman living together are husband and wife. They must also come to a conclusion about how long the two have been living together because another clause refers to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
the tax being due on a daily basis. If the tax is levied on a daily basis and is to be paid jointly and severally if more than one person is liable, each local authority will have to maintain substantial records to get at the facts for each house or flat to determine who is liable and for how many days. The bureaucracy involved will be enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further aspect of the problem is the chronic housing shortage in the United Kingdom. People are moving in and out of properties all the time, and with the number of repossessions that are taking place it is not always possible to establish who is the owner. Much is jointly owned by a number of people who contribute financially, not always in the same proportions, towards a particular property. So a local authority will have to delve into those aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider clause 9 with clause 6. We know that there are an enormous number of marriage break-ups. In the majority of cases, the male partner leaves the family house and the female partner remains. Unfortunately, there are many cases throughout the United Kingdom where the money needed to pay household bills goes with the male who leaves the household, so the female who remains does not have enough money to meet some of those outgoings. The phrase in the clause "jointly and severally liable" impinges disproportionately on many females who must meet the costs which males have abrogated by leaving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that in many households the male holds the purse strings and gives his wife housekeeping money? Does he think that when that money is allocated, the man will say to his wife, "This is a proportion for you to pay your poll tax or council tax."? Will there be a conscious allocation of money for that purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is interesting, and that may be the case in some circumstances. It adds to the point that I am trying to make—it was also made by the hon. Member for Dagenham—which is that the clause is extremely unhelpful and adds nothing to the Bill. Indeed, I am surprised that the Government want to include it and wonder whether they did so intentionally. Was the clause included merely because it was in the poll tax legislation and the issue had not been raised? If so, they would not lose face if they were to say that they would at least reconsider the matter. Certainly, local authorities would not lose funds but, as the Bill stands, they will have a hard task trying to collect the money. The Government should help local authorities collect whatever taxes are necessary for local government finance, not make their job more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seems to have been taken out of the poll tax legislation, it makes no sense in the Bill and it presents us with a dilemma. When there is a mixture of a property tax and a personal tax there will always be difficulties. The Government could solve the problem by withdrawing clause 9 and approving the amendment to clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Government might have picked up the point and included an amending clause of their own. The amendments are completely uncontroversial. Surely, sufferers from Alzheimer's disease or any similar condition that causes severe mental infirmity should not be subject to joint and several liability. It is obvious that anyone who is exempt from personal liability, for whatever reason, should not have to face joint and several liability. I am surprised that that point was not accepted at once. I shall be interested to hear why not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prisoners will continue to be exempt from personal liability, as they were under the poll tax. Prisoners come out of prison and are faced with a bill for their partner's arrears of poll tax, as well as for their own arrears. We must talk about the real world. Often, marriages do not survive the lengthy imprisonment of one partner. The spouse at home has great difficulty keeping the household together and, in many cases, walks out leaving many bills unpaid, including bills for arrears of poll tax and property tax. The partner who comes out of prison is hardly helped to go straight in future if he or she is immediately confronted with bills that are not even his or her responsibility. That requires a re-think on the part of the Government. In such circumstances, the partner who receives the bill must prove what has happened to an official at the town hall in the case of the poll tax. As far as I can tell, that requirement will continue under the new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a marriage breaks cleanly and finally, it may seem relatively simple to explain the situation to an official and to show the relevant evidence, but real lives are not so tidy. Couples sometimes spend a while separating and getting together again before they finally decide whether to divorce or to get together again permanently. It is ridiculous for the partner who remains in the family home to keep trekking to the town hall to say, "We separated from 1 March to 4 April. Then we got together again on 10 May and stayed together until 11 July". That is how many households live until they finally decide what they want to do. There are many divorces and a substantial number of people face the sort of problems that I have outlined. The Government ought to pay heed to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) remarked that the woman, who is the partner likely to be left behind, is also likely to be the lower paid partner and to have custody of the children. When she already has those problems on her mind, she will be landed with her husband's bill. It should not be a principle that one spouse or partner must be automatically willing to pay bills run up by the other. Hon. Members all know that the Christian marriage service includes the vow "for richer, for poorer", but that does not mean that the law of the land should make "poorer" a more likely outcome than "richer".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government add insult to injury by introducing joint and several liability for the council tax, and by expanding liability beyond the spouse or partner living with the liable taxpayer.

Conservative party, I am surprised that the Government did not scrap completely joint and several liability obligations. Women are outraged that they have been made jointly and severally liable. In many men it has brought out an unpleasant chauvanism: they refuse to pay their wife's tax. That has engendered a great deal of unpleasantness about the tax, yet the Government now propose to extend liability to tax to residents who occupy premises on the same terms as the liable person. They are to be jointly and severally liable for the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) suggested that this provision might have slipped through inadvertently from the previous legislation, but I refer him to what CSL has to say about joint and several liability to the tax. The CSL report states that backlogs in the poll tax cause enormous problems for local government. Those backlogs will continue when the new tax is introduced, in addition to the other problems that the council tax will bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its report published in September 1991, CSL says that clear and specific details should be given on billing, collection and recovery so that local authorities understand what they are required to do, particularly when a council tax payer defaults. Everyone who may be jointly and severally liable to the council tax should also be clear about billing, collection and recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CSL report on the council tax contains a list of those liable to pay the tax. It appears on page 4 at paragraph 6.1 under the heading "Liability to Tax":
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"The person liable to pay the tax on any day is the one who falls under the … descriptions below …:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>he is resident and has the freehold of the whole or any part of the dwelling.</li>
	<li>he"—</li></ol>
</div> <!-- ul -->
it is always "he", because, unfortunately, "she" does not exist in legislation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is a resident and has a leasehold on all or part of the dwelling which is not inferior to another leasehold held by another resident.
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(c) he is resident and is a statutory tenant (under the Rent Act 1977 or Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976) or a secure tenant (under Part IV or the Housing Act 1985) of all or part of the dwelling.</li>
	<li>(d) he is a resident with a contractual licence to occupy all or part of the dwelling</li>
	<li>(e) he is a resident.</li>
	<li>(f) he owns all or part of the dwelling."</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
Paragraph 6.3 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If two or more people fall under the first applicable description then they are each jointly and severally liable."</p></blockquote>
How are people to know all that? Should we have in our houses details of all the legislation that is quoted in the various qualifications for being jointly and severally liable? How will people know whether they are exempt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. The uncollectability of the tax will also be a problem for local authorities. How will they know who is liable and whom to pursue under joint and several liability if the liable person defaults?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen when the second, third and fourth people living in the accommodation are not the partner of the liable person? How will the local authority know who the partner is because that person, presumably, will be the first to be jointly and severally liable. On what authority will the local authority require the information about private individuals to be supplied, to assist in the recovery of tax? How will the local authorities know those facts unless they have registers for the properties? The Government have told us that there will not be a register. In Bristol, will we have aircraft taking off from Lulsgate airport to establish who is resident in a property so that they can be identified—by aerial photography—as jointly and severally liable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint and several liability provision, as with the poll tax, will not be based on the ability to pay of the person or persons held to be jointly and severally liable. The debt of the person who is principally liable will be transferred to the person who is jointly and severally liable. Women throughout the country will need to think carefully about a Government who profess a commitment to equality for women, under a Prime Minister who has, at last, discovered the principle of equality of women and who wants to introduce legislation to that end. That same Government are introducing legislation that will demand information from women about their relationships with those who will be liable to pay the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the amendments do not propose the abolition of joint and several liability. However, they attempt to remove some of its worst and most inhumane excesses. How will local authorities be able to administer the provision? How will they be able to ensure that those who may be jointly and severally liable have their rights explained to them so that from the outset they know that they may be liable to pay something? That would prevent the possiblity mentioned by my hon. friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), of their being liable to a retrospective tax. It is possible that someone who has lived in a house and moved away may be jointly and severally liable for the proportion of the tax due for the period when the person was resident in the house. Finding that out some time after moving away could cause considerable problems.

The argument on the amendment is finely balanced. We seem to be discussing what central principle is involved. The central issue would be clear if we say that all adults—not being mentally handicapped—students, and YTS trainees should pay something if they are in a one or two-adult household. If that statement were linked with another that said that, in most circumstances, students would not pay anything, the bill would broadly provide for both statements. However, if we wanted to say that, in no circumstances would students be liable to pay, the Bill would not provide for that and we have already discussed examples of co-ownership and co-tenanting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two significant principles come into conflict. I do not have a strong view on which of those two principles should take precedence. I can see an argument for both. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon.

Joint liability for bills is fairly standard practice. Some of the comments of the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) notwithstanding, many people share their heating bills, rent and other bills. If two principles are broadly supported, we should consider which way is administratively simpler. It is not a black and white issue—both principles are strong.

I am sure that the Government are deciding which would be the better option to follow. I assume that what I am speaking for in connection with students may apply to other areas. Arguably, that logic should follow through.

The relationship that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has with the strange gentleman from the Scottish Office must be cleared up once and for all. If there is an accident next time the Under-Secretary and my hon. Friend are in the back seat of a car driving somewhere from Glasgow airport, will they be jointly and severally liable for the repair to the corporate vehicle?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this were simply a roof tax, there would be no big deal about people being jointly and severally liable. Indeed, that would seem an appropriate way in most circumstances of handling the situation. However, we are dealing not with a roof tax but with a clear dividing line between a roof tax and a poll tax, in which case joint and several liability is a major component in the public's perception of whether this is a fair way of collecting the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax is about self-collection in many respects. The joint and several liability arrangements were not simply borrowed from the poll tax legislation. The Government have learnt from the example of privatised public utilities, which use such procedures in a draconian way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the past two or three years I have been concerned with constituency cases to do with the poll tax and public utilities. Only when a default takes place does the innocent victim become aware of his technical liability for the debt. Arising from that technical liability are a number of important factors
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
which I believe interfere with civil liberties, personal income and the home environment, particularly when a single person—usually female—with children is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not joint and several liability often applied retrospectively to people who have little or no income?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.

That is not simply an attack on low income at the point of receipt of benefit, but an attempt to withdraw from the benefit at source a payment which was the liability of someone who previously lived in a property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is also true of homes in multiple occupation. Sometimes a student, sometimes a leaseholder, sometimes another individual is made responsible for the collection of rents and other tenancy matters. In some cases the public utilities have made that person responsible for the debts of someone who has left the property, and have threatened disconnection. There is a long record of public opposition to joint and several liability because of the way in which it has been applied—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
