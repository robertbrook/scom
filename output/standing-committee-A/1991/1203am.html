	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [28 November]:</i> No. 236, in page 19, line 41, after "below", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and having considered the incidence of council tax on the residents in its area".—	<i>(Mr. Murphy.)</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Seceretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had an interesting and comparatively short debate on Thursday evening about the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). In his strong contribution, the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) raised the issue of the reaction to the council tax of the Institute of Fiscal Studies. The IFS figures show that under the council tax 37 per cent. of households will lose, 37 per cent. will gain and 26 per cent. will be broadly unaffected compared with how they are affected under the community charge. I agree in general with those figures. The Opposition and the IFS say that the wider range of tax bills will affect not the balance of gainers and losers but the amounts of the gains and losses. I am sure that the hon. Member for Leyton will accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require the billing authority to consider the incidence of the council tax on the residents of its area before setting the amounts of council tax. That may seem reasonable, but it reveals a misconception about the clause which, despite its importance, is not concerned with the exercise of any significant discretion by the billing authority. The main decisions about the budget requirement and the amounts of council tax are to be taken by a billing authority in accordance with clauses 32 to 36 and by major precepting authorities under the equivalent clauses, clauses 43 to 47. Clause 30 simply requires the billing authority to calculate overall amounts of council tax for dwellings in each valuation band in each part of its area by adding amounts of tax calculated already by the billing authority and by the major precepting authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, this is not the right moment to consider the incidence of the tax. Having said that, I have no argument with the view that the local authority should consider the impact on council tax payers when deciding its budget requirement and the resulting level of tax. That is elementary good sense, which we try to encourage. However, it is not what Opposition Members have in mind. It is not for the tax-setting authority to consider how the tax might impact on a particular household or individual. That is a matter for the design of the benefit system and the discount system, which are outside the amendment's scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the general agreement about the importance of a local authority considering the impact on council tax
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>678</span>
payers and given that this is not the moment to enter into that argument, I ask the Committee to join me in resisting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the first part of the Under-Secretary's reply when he acknowledged the difficulty regarding the impact of the council tax on different people. However, I disagree fundamentally with his second point that the setting authority—the local authority involved—should be unconcerned about the incidence of a tax on its people. Those of my hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies and who have seen the tremendous burden imposed by the poll tax on the people whom they represent, particularly in Strathclyde, could not possibly agree with that general philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local authority has a duty to consider the incidence of the tax on its people, particularly when it does not agree with the philosophy behind that tax. The difficulties could have been lessened if weeks ago the Government had been prepared to accept the amendments on regional banding, because the regional disparities would have been made more obvious and people would have been better protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 237, in page 20, leave out lines 6 and 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 263, in page 20, line 6, leave out subsection (3).</p>
	<p>No. 266, in schedule 10, page 121, line 21, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) The calculation made under subsection (1) above shall not cause the aggregate of the amounts payable in respect of revenue support grant and redistributed non-domestic rates to exceed the authority's budget requirement.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments draw attention to the negative tax procedure. The clause deals with setting the amounts of council tax for every dwelling, but it is complex and contains anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange if people receive local authority services but do not contribute towards them, but that could happen under these proposals. On 6 November, the Department of the Environment issued a press release which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under our council tax proposals some district councils, because of prudent housekeeping, are likely to receive more redistributed non-domestic rates (NDR) and Revenue Support Grant (RSG) than they wish to spend."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Government would give them money that they would not spend on services. Some authorities will receive revenue support grant but will not spend it on providing services while other authorities will be capped because they spend too much money on services: they will be denied extra resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary explain the principle whereby some communities will be denied a proper level of services because the RSG formula was weighted against their authorities but other authorities that do not wish to provide additional services will be given money that they will not spend on providing services? That is a strange formula and we need an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press release went on to say that the Government did not propose to claw back non-domestic rates or revenue support grant from councils that receive more than they wish to spend. It stated:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>679</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Instead we are seeking Parliament's approval ... to permit district councils in this position to use surplus NDR and RSG for the benefit of local taxpayers by offsetting the county precepts in their areas."</p></blockquote>
So those fortunate district councils will be able to use that pools windfall to offset their county precepts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government believe that that will happen, why do they not pay the money to the county in the first place? That would offset the county's extra precept demand on residents. If the Government accept that the counties will be hard pressed, why do they not pay the surplus that districts will receive in RSG and NDR straight to the county? Such a distribution would make it clear that the Government recognise that the counties are under great pressure to provide services such as community care and social services, as well as police, fire and other services. The same is true of the districts and the London boroughs. Therefore, why do the Government not pass on a possible surplus in the accounts straight to the people who have problems raising the resources that are needed to meet their obligations to provide services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put a question to the Under-Secretary: is not one of the reasons for distributing that surplus more fairly than presently proposed the fact that such a change in the formula would benefit some Labour authorities? Will he explain the Government's attitude to authorities that are denied the opportunity to provide better services by the make-up of the formula?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local government department of Conservative central office has published a document dealing with the council tax entitled "A Guide for Party Workers". However, the document does not acknowledge that the Government might face the embarrassing possibility that they will give money to authorities through the revenue support grant and the non-domestic rate with the result that people will receive services without contributing. Referring to whether districts and counties will have separate bills, page 13 of the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government review of local government means that over the years there will be more unitary authorities, where the question will not arise."</p></blockquote>
If that is the Government's proposal, what is the reasoning behind their present plans to offer, as the press release has made clear, the districts money that they will not be able to spend? That contradicts the assertion that the problem will not arise because unitary authorities will be established. I hope that the Under-Secretary will explain that contradiction. What will be the position when the counties are abolished? Will some districts receive more in RSG and NDR than they will spend? Have the Government investigated that possibility? Will there be proposals in which the principles embodied in the press release apply to unitary authorities? I should be grateful for answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"A Guide for Party Workers" goes on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Meanwhile the Government proposes that grant and UBR should be paid separately to each tier and that bills should show clearly the amount of each tier's spending which council tax payers are being asked to fund."</p></blockquote>
The document does not say anything about the spending that council tax payers will not have to fund, where a surplus is given to local authorities whose response to the formula does not include the provision of services. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>680</span>
principle outlined in the press release is not followed in the document. Conservative central office is misleading its workers about negative tax levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A paragraph headed "Notes to Editors" in the press release states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present, RSG and NDR are paid into the collection fund administered by charging authorities in respect of all local authority services in an area."</p></blockquote>
If payment is made into the collection fund for the provision of services, it is difficult to understand how an authority can provide, but not charge for, services such as refuse collection, the maintenance of estate roads and street lighting or how it can pay staff, maintain buildings and meet the energy costs of buildings such as old people's day centres, in view of the strictures of local government and in accordance with the principles involved. We must have an explanation of the ways in which local authorities can provide services without charging their tax payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), the Under-Secretary said that an assessment was made of gainers and losers under the poll tax system. I assume that in analysing the effects of the Bill, there will have been some assessment of the likely gainers and losers and of how many people will have to pay nothing because of their local authority's cash flow. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would give us the results of any assessment that has been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in the Committee Room would wish to receive services but make no contribution towards them. The principle of the poll tax was that everyone should make some contribution to local services. The Bill promises Tory party workers that people will pay for services provided by the local authority if their income allows it. We have been told, thank heaven, that people on income support will not have to contribute. That will apply from 1 April 1993. Why cannot it apply from 1 April 1992?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one inside the Committee Room or outside it would accept that those who can afford to contribute to local services should not do so. However, negative taxing could mean that people earning £30,000 or £40,000 a year would not pay anything towards district services. If the Under-Secretary has done his homework on the people involved, perhaps he will clarify the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press release refers to districts. When a district receives the concession of the payment of UBR and RSG, the district tax rate will be negative. Will people in that district also receive the 25 per cent. discount if they live alone in a property? It would be interesting to know whether people who are not paying for services receive an additional handout. Those people have been described as not in need of a discount, because it is calculated not on a person's needs but on his status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw attention to the 28 November press release issued by the Department of Social Security which announces the council tax benefit. It announces increases in income support and other benefits to help people pay local taxes. It says that the Government will make provision for people who could face hardship because of the new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Security held discussions about a clawback? Would a person who lives in a district that levies a negative tax still receive the increase in the social security payment? If so, I must remind the Committee that we are constantly being told that social benefits will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>681</span>
paid only to people in need. If local authorities to not press their council tax payers for payment but the Department of Social Security hands out payments to cover the cost of local services, it could be argued that payments are being made to people who will not spend that money on services. Therefore, they do not need that payment. What is the Government's attitude to that? We consider that the level of social security benefit is much too low, but if we accept the principle espoused by the Secretary of State for Social Security that Government money is targeted only at people in need, there seems to be a mismatch between the principle applied by the Department of Social Security and the proposal in clause 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary should consider several issues when he responds to the amendments because clause 30 has implications for local authorities. Our amendments would ensure that there is no negative taxing and that people make some contribution—according to their need —to local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary considers that there should be zero-taxing, will he explain why some people receive services free and others have to pay extra? In many instances, people will not receive services because of the capping of local authority expenditure. I am sure that all hon. Members have the interests of local government at heart: the question is how we approach the issue of providing the resources for its services. We all have problems when considering how to provide resources and facilities for the community care programme and for physically disabled people and for mentally handicapped people. Perhaps the Government could rethink the formula and transfer any excess resources in the UBR and RSG to authorities in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment circulated to members of the working group considering settlements an example of the complex formula involved in setting the council tax. Without copies of the formula in front of members of the Committee it is difficult to explain the matter in detail, but I want to refer to it because of its importance in providing the resources for local authorities and because of the influence of such a formula on authorities receiving benefit under UBR and RSG.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To which formula is the hon. Gentleman referring? There are several in the Bill and, if I am to answer him properly, I must know which one he means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pass the hon. Gentleman a copy. The Department of the Environment produced that example of how the calculations will be worked out for a meeting of the settlements working group. We want to be fair to the Under-Secretary and do not want to ask him questions for which we know that he has no answers, but he must comment to this issue. As my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) has said, when one has to consider such a formula without the advantage of an explanation from those who drew it up, it is difficult to understand how they arrived at those figures. I should appreciate observations from the Under-Secretary on a formula that influences the finances and the operations of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the formula like a game of craps with, unfortunately on this occasion, loaded dice? The dice is loaded against the majority of local authorities in urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>682</span>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to loaded dice and, as we have seen in other instances, the question of who benefits what and where is a game of chance. It is difficult to see how the formula is fair. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will explain how the fairness in the formula applies to local authorities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield highlighted, our suspicion is that it is loaded against authorities that want to provide services in favour of those that do not. I could quote example after example of local authorities that have difficulties because they cannot employ enough social workers or provide the services that people need. I hope that the Under-Secretary will comment on our observations on the formula used for calculating the money required by the major precepting authorities, to provide facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider that the clause is not in the best interests of local government. Local authority associations have pointed out the problems that will arise. The amendments would allow greater flexibility in the redistribution of RSG and NDR to authorities that want to provide services. I appeal to Conservative Members to support these constructive amendments which would help local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been looking through the amendments and I notice that all those on the provisional list deal with the determination of the council tax, such as financial expenditure and administrative precepts. As amendments, they could invite virtually a Second Reading debate, which would be tempting to the Committee. As long as the proceedings remains in order, the Chairman can do nothing about that, but there could be considerable repetition if we had a type of Second Reading debate. I realise that it will be difficult to avoid that, but it would help if hon. Members concentrated on the amendment when trying to squeeze the last drop of juice out of it. However, I sympathise with the Committee, because there is a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) has said, the purpose of the amendments is to limit the payment of RSG to authorities so that the aggregate of the grant and NDR payments does not exceed the authority's budget requirements. We should take the matter seriously, because there might be weighting. Although the Government say that the provision is helpful and friendly and will enable shire authorities to pay less, it could be damaging because some local authorities might feel encouraged—the Government's press release said "helped"—to be low spenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We often use acronyms when discussing local government finance. We refer to the NDR and the RSG, but the SSA—the standard spending assessment—is also important. The clause encourages authorities to spend less than their SSA. We often have debates on local government Bills about whether SSAs are accurate or whether they are proving to be notional. Clause 30 fundamentally undermines SSAs, not only for the districts but for the counties. Either there is a SSA for district needs and for county needs, or there is not. The Government cannot go through the process of working out the standard spending assessment, and then say that some authorities can have a rebate because the needs element is irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>683</span>
They are interested only in getting the bill down and in ensuring that spending is low because low spending is of itself a good thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on a good point. At first glance, the provision is an incentive to local authorities not only to spend less but to spend below their needs assessment. That is the only way that they can save money. In the longer term, it may also be a trap. I cannot believe that a local authority that spent below its needs assessment and benefited from the provision, would be able to argue with any confidence or credibility that it needed RSG or NDR for future years, is not the provision part of a widespread attack on local government spending and service delivery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend drives the point home well. Authorities that read the Government press release which said that they would get help may find that there is no help. Their view of their SSAs will be undermined year after year. Every year the Government will tell them that, if they did not need the money one year, they will not need it the next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basic needs should be provided for in our society. SSAs should bear some relationship to them. The proposal will prove to be a disincentive to local authorities to provide nurseries, for example, at a time when all hon. Members and society in general believe that the need for nursery provision is fundamental. The proposal will undermine the provision of nurseries in places such as East Sussex and Kent, which, unlike Leeds, do not have good records. Leeds has an excellent record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not undermine the general acceptance of the need for nursery provision by saying that there will be a clawback on the budget. When the Government refer in their cosy language to "prudent housekeeping", it means that East Sussex and Kent will get no nearer to providing nursery education. Prudent housekeeping will be seen as having the money back and not providing that basic service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that they want the money to offset the county precepts. We must ask what the county provides and whether county provision of services will not be enhanced, but will remain the same or be reduced on the basis of the reduction in SSA. People will find not that they receive some services free, but that they do not receive some at all—in other words, there will be a reduction in services. Will the Under-Secretary explain how the clause will not fundamentally undermine and finish off the SSA?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It proves that the SSA is a notional guesstimate to which local authorities should pay no attention. Far from rewarding "prudent housekeeping", the proposal would mean that authorities that cut services to reduce their expenditure below the level of their needs assessment would be rewarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) reminded us that the matter does not stop there. The clause will undermine local authorities' ability to put forward a budget for enhancing or maintaining existing services. Local authorities may want to welcome the measure as prudent housekeeping, but they will find that the clause fundamentally undermines their budget year after year and consequently reduces services that they wish to provide.

We should tread cautiously around the clause. The amendment should be accepted to ensure equity, balancing the needs of an area against the resources raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning's debate goes to the heart of the battle over local government spending which has gone on for the past decade. That battle has been fought over the year-on-year redistribution of resources among local authorities. As each redistribution takes place, the Government's manipulation of funding systems becomes more obvious. Through the calculations of standard spending assessments for the poll tax and the related revenue support grant, the Government have undermined local authorities, which—for reasons to do with population, environment and unemployment—are at the sharp end of service delivery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I should like to put it on record that Hackney, Lambeth, Islington and Tower Hamlets each receive more money than any other authority. Three of those authorities are controlled by the Labour party and the other is controlled by the Liberal Democrats. By any standards, that scarcely fits the hon. Gentleman's description.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By any standards, those four boroughs are the poorest in Britain. They are among the poorest parts of Europe. That is an indictment of 12 years of the Government's inner-city policies. It is unacceptable that areas in inner London should get assistance at the expense of other inner-city areas in the regions, while boroughs such as Wandsworth and Westminster get what amounts to a tax holiday in terms of the resources that they receive compared with the services that they provide. We do not need lessons from the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) about local government resources. We have lived with that problem in the north-west and in other parts of Britain for more than a decade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman will take the opportunity then of defending the inequities of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, in his press release of 6 November, put in a nutshell the Government's real attitude to public expenditure. They do not regard it as a system for an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>685</span>
equitable redistribution of resources that takes account of local authorities' provision of services to meet the community's needs. They do not see it in terms of the ability to meet the costs of local authority expenditure or in terms of equity for metropolitan authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rule changes over the past few years have done away with precepting authorities under county control for such services as passenger transport. In respect of the calculation for RSG, such services have been passed down to the districts. They pick up the costs of running transport in the metropolitan areas. Local authorities will be capped as a result of having to take on precepting requirements that used to be the responsibility of passenger transport authorities. The significant difference between the ways in which calculations are made in non-metropolitan and in metropolitan authorities is that non-metropolitan authorities have retained the ability to precept for such things as transport whereas that ability has passed from metropolitan authorities to the districts. Their expenditure is therefore grossly enlarged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is even worse: because of the way in which SSA is calculated, and from that RSG, wealthy metropolitan boroughs are subsidised for political reasons at the expense of other local authority areas. The Government have continued and even extended those arrangements. The standard spending assessment of metropolitan authorities in the north-west, Yorkshire and Merseyside is set so that the amount that they are expected to spend to provide services is radically different from the amount provided to boroughs such as Wandsworth for similar, or even inferior, services. That is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past decade, there have been two significant shifts in the way in which the Government have calculated the distribution of resources. They have withdrawn resources from those parts of the country where there is high unemployment and the structure of the economy leads to social deprivation. There is considerable pressure on local authorities from which the Government have withdrawn huge resources. That is difficult to understand, especially because the Government provide resources to those authorities through the urban programme, to give credence to the fact that they have major social and economic problems. On one hand, identifying authorities for the urban programme seems to reveal, in terms of overall expenditure, a major reduction in resources—tens of millions of pounds that could have been spent on the protection and development of core services have been withdrawn from Wigan. On the other hand, the Government have given the authority a few million pounds from the urban programme in recognition of the serious environmental and social problems that exist in the borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes no sense to identify an authority that requires additional resources, because of its economic and financial make-up, if the funding for core services is significantly reduced year-on-year. That is how the Government have effectively reduced the resources allocated to local authorities such as Wigan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that Wigan is not alone; he visits my constituency regularly. With the Under-Secretary, he has met representatives of my local authority and of other metropolitan areas, such as the Severn authorities, that have broadly similar populations, financial resources,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>686</span>
unemployment and environment. Such authorities lose year in and year out, because of the way in which the Government set the standard spending assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a body blow to elected members of those authorities, to the officers, to community groups and to all those involved in the delivery of services to be told that, once again, there will be a substantial reduction in resources for the provision of core services in their areas. It is worse to find out, within days of that news, that significant resources have been shifted to local authorities which, because they refuse to spend up to their needs requirement, as stipulated by the Department of the Environment, receive a financial bonus. Authorities that meet the needs of their community, as assessed by the Department, lose substantially—not tens of thousands of pounds but tens of millions of pounds. Year-on-year, core services are significantly reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham, Sheffield, St. Helens, Wakefield and Wigan are some of the authorities affected. They have consistently put their joint case to the Under-Secretary and the Minister. Discussions have taken place on the inadequacies of a system that fines those authorities which, on the Minister's calculations, provide core services for local government at a cost relatively below the average for services in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point about whether SSAs reflect accurately expenditure authority by authority. My borough of Havering has made the same representations that Barnsley and Doncaster have made over the years. However, I urge him, in mid-rant, to distinguish that aspect and the constant need to improve SSAs from his sustained and unremitting attack on the totality of support for areas of high stress which, as I have pointed out before, is not borne out by the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way again to the hon. Gentleman, not because he makes a valid point, with which I shall deal in a moment, but because my accent and the way in which I deliver my speech are my business. I do not rant. I take exception to attempts to have a go at my accent and at the way in which I deliver my contributions. If Conservative Members put as much effort into trying to defend their case as I do into defending mine, they would be in a better position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) defend, if that is what he is attempting to do, the Government's calculations of SSAs? Let me cite the example of my authority compared with Wandsworth, the pet authority of Conservative Members. If the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowiss) wishes to intervene on this point, I shall give way to him. On the calculation for dealing with children in need, the document submitted to the Minister by the seven authorities states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The real impact of the existing approach to the SSA calculation can be judged if one assumes that the child population of, say, Wigan and, say, Wandsworth is the same.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>For example, if both areas had 50,000 children:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Children's PSS SSA for Wigan would be:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>3·8 per cent. x 50,000 x £1,925 =£3·6 million:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Children's PSS SSA for Wandsworth would be:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>8·3 per cent. x 50,000 x £5,023 = £20·8 million."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities have a statutory requirement to look after children who are at risk, children who are potentially at risk and children whose families need assistance from time to time for various reasons. How can the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>687</span>
Gentleman defend a system that expects Wigan to provide that service for £3·6 million, yet Wandsworth gets up to £20·8 million for providing the same service? That does not add up in terms of economics or social fairness. However, it does add up to a massive political handout to Conservative-supported authorities in the south-east at the expense of authorities in the north-west.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, even though he has waited a long time to do so. He is trying to compare like with unlike. The costs of providing any service in London are higher than in other parts of the country. The basic formulae used are brought forward after consultation, negotiation and agreement with the local authority associations. If the hon. Gentleman has a complaint about the broad pattern, he should take it to his local authority association, which his party dominates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman compares like with like, such as the neighbouring, comparable inner-London boroughs of Lambeth under Labour and Wandsworth under the Conservatives, he will find that the allocation to all services is higher by a third in Lambeth than it is in Wandsworth, yet the quality of service in Wandsworth is much better. The hon. Gentleman should look at the way in which local government operates and consider the record of Labour-controlled authorities that spend unwisely or fail to collect the rents and charges that help to pay for better services. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the £800,000 that Wigan loses on its swimming pool every year or the £700,000 that it loses on the Wigan pier complex is wise spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman may like to explain why, when Merton became a Labour-controlled instead of a Conservative-controlled authority, the funding criteria changed dramatically? In terms of financial resources from central Government, it is now in a significantly worse position. The figures are there to be seen and I do not know why Conservative Members try to pretend otherwise. Local authorities such as Wigan provide a service that is broadly similar to that provided by Wandsworth, but at a cheaper cost to its poll tax payers. But because it is prudent, it is capped at the end of the year. Conservative Members can bluster as much as they like from a sedentary position, but they cannot change the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to contrast what happens in London boroughs such as Merton which is Labour controlled, and Wandsworth, which is Conservative controlled. Last year, Merton received an increase of 19 per cent.—the bottom of the range—and Wandsworth received an increase of 24·7 per cent. That differential has been built in to this year's standard spending assessment, so Merton is paying the price for voting Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend substantiates my argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever I visit Wigan—with great pleasure—I am told that Manchester has done so much better than Wigan. When I am interviewed on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>688</span>
television in the north-west, the same point is made. Manchester has a Labour-controlled authority and it is in the north-west. The hon. Gentleman misrepresents the debate in his area. It is not principally about whether London boroughs have greater needs than Wigan but about whether a metropolitan borough in Manchester, which is Labour controlled, has greater needs than Wigan, as is reflected in the SSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I defend that position because it is fair, but the hon. Gentleman would be accurate if he admitted that that is what the debate is about. It gives the lie to the suggestion that SSAs are politically determined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was rather disingenuous, given that on two recent occasions I made that point in the Chamber—once during environment questions and once after a statement by the Secretary of State. I asked why authorities in a broadly similar geographical area should have to provide similar services when Wigan, for example, has 69 per cent. less income a year, but the Minister defended that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For politically motivated reasons, the redistribution of money throughout the country has been refined every year. That has resulted in huge disparities between local authorities. We have now reached a stage where the way in which SSAs are calculated is entirely discredited. Metropolitan authorities have told the Minister that the Bill provides an opportunity to end those disparities, but he has failed to take it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a simple point. I agree with my hon. Friend that the system of SSAs has been totally discredited, for the very reasons that he gave. The fact that it is also used in some instances for party political purposes does not invalidate that point. It is an essential complaint about SSAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, as he always has been when defining precisely what the Minister means. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am prepared to give way to the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) if he wants to participate in the debate. If he does not, I hope that he will stop whispering in my left ear, because it is becoming boring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later today or perhaps early tomorrow morning, depending on where we have reached when the guillotine falls at midnight, we shall discuss the way in which the Government have withdrawn precepting arrangements for transport in metropolitan authorities. That has had a disastrous effect on the provision of transport facilities and has made local authorities financially responsible for the development of transport strategies in their areas. That has led to capping in social services, education, housing, personal services and the care of children at work. All the core services have been drastically affected by the political change in the funding of transport at metropolitan and district level from precepting arrangements, which still obtain for the non-metropolitan counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised the issue of Manchester. I was pleased about that, as it illustrated the grotesqueness of the Government's position in regard to SSAs for Manchester and, for that matter, Liverpool. The Minister's attempt to embarrass me failed because it proved that the Government are stuck in a cul-de-sac in trying to calculate SSAs to redistribute resources. They have introduced a formula that undermines medium-sized metropolitan
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>689</span>
boroughs and urban communities. How can the Government defend the fact that Wigan, which lies 16 miles from Manchester, will have about 70 per cent. less in core funding to spend on providing services broadly similar to last year's?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, why are Wigan, St. Helens and other authorities on Merseyside expected to provide their statutory core services with that level of resources? The professional quality of those services is expected at least to equal that provided by the best in the same band of metropolitan authorities. How can authorities such as Wigan achieve that under capping and when tens of millions of pounds have been withdrawn in the current financial year to meet the requirements set by the Secretary of State for the Environment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, the Secretary of State cannot answer that question. He will shuffle it off by saying that it is a local authority's responsibility to determine the spending level in each of its departments. When resources are cut from the education budget, the Secretary of State for Education will stand up at Question Time and attack local authorities such as Wigan for cutting education expenditure. However, the real culprit is the Secretary of State for the Environment, who has withdrawn tens of millions of pounds from my local authority's budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I witnessed only a few months ago, the Secretary of State for the Environment sent civil servants to my local authority. Those of us at the coalface were happy to show them how we were able to provide value-for-money services. The Secretary of State congratulated Wigan on having the lowest level of lets in council house properties in the United Kingdom and on having the lowest council house debts. Despite those plaudits, the same Secretary of State cut millions of pounds from the housing investment programme when the calculations for SSA and RSG were complete. No doubt, in weeks to come, the Secretary of State will score party political points at Question Time by picking on the budgets of authorities such as Wigan for reductions. He will shift the blame for his fiddled system and the twisted logic of SSAs on to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a powerful case. One damning aspect of all this is that, in effect, the Government have made the argument about value for money worthless. There is no proper measure from authority to authority of what represents value for money. There can be no proper comparison between authorities when there are differences—that is the kindest word—in SSAs. That is especially damning because it is most important that authorities should work to achieve value for money and be seen by the public to be doing so. It is a terrible indictment of the Government that they have made that a worthless criterion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. I take the point further: value-for-money exercises have been completed by the Audit Commission and by other independent organisations. Wigan is an authority that correctly claims that the Government have deliberately undermined its ability to provide core services because of the SSA formula. Wigan's provision of services and its cost per head are used as a weathervane and are compared with those of Conservative-controlled local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most recent survey was carried out by the Audit Commission in respect of core services provided by Wigan and by the London borough of Wandsworth. In each of the tests, Wigan's services represented better value for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>690</span>
money in terms of quality, range and cost of delivery, yet there is no kick-back of resources to Wigan and no withdrawal of resources from Wandsworth. The hon. Member for Battersea shakes his head, but there is a huge subsidy to Wandsworth—to enable the hon. Gentleman to keep his seat in Parliament—and a huge withdrawal of resources from Wigan, a local authority that has been proved to provide value-for-money services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that that evidence is from the Audit Commission, not from the Government. We should ask the Minister to get the Audit Commission to carry out that exercise for every local authority. It might find that most Labour local authorities give better value for money overall than Conservative authorities. [HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] Hon. Members shake their heads but I ask: what is the Minister scared of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say what is in the Minister's head, although I have attempted on occasions to find out. I hope that, when I sit down, all will be revealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take as an example children at risk, on whom the minds of the House and the country are focused at present, for many reasons. The Secretary of State expects Wigan to provide core statutory services for children taken into care and support services for children on the "at risk" register. Wigan has to provide those services at a maximum of £1,925 a child. The figure for Wandsworth is £4,952, which is even higher than the £3,223 for inner-city Manchester. Wigan and Manchester lose because of the shift of resources from areas of high unemployment and social deprivation to areas such as Wandsworth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is again comparing like with unlike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can respond to the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) in the twinkling of an eye: the Audit Commission has already carried out the review that he requests. Its investigation into inner-London boroughs showed conclusively that, when run by the Conservative party, inner-London boroughs produce twice the level of services at half the cost. Those are the facts. The report gives them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) compared Merton, which is an outer-London borough, with an inner-London borough. When the Labour party took control of Merton, there was no change in the needs assessment or the SSA but its community charge rocketed overnight. When the change went the other way politically in outer-London Hillingdon, the community charge was immediately reduced. The reason is political. The hon. Gentleman is interested in the political consequences of management of local authorities, so he can compare Wandsworth and Lambeth in inner London and Hillingdon and Merton in outer London. The message is clear: if you vote Labour, it costs you more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention shows in tooth and claw, the Tory concept of the provision of local government services and how grotesque and party-political the matter has become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were talking about children at risk. How can a sexually abused child be considered less at risk in Wigan than in Wandsworth? In Wandsworth eight times as much money has been provided for children at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea says that I am not comparing like with like, but if a child is abused, it is abused whether it is in Wandsworth or Wigan and the authority has a statutory responsibility to provide services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>691</span>
to protect it. Why should eight times as much money be given for those services in Wandsworth as in Wigan? I am sure that hon. Gentleman is not saying that there are eight times as many abused children in Wandsworth. The grotesqueness of his argument is highlighted by that example. My authority has to provide the same core services, the same interventionist, first-class services with vastly reduced resources. It receives under £4 million compared with £20 million. That is unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before we embark on another tangential argument, I wish to point out that the amendment refers to the lines:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having a shot, and so far I have got about 10 bull's eyes. We are talking about the calculation relative to a negative tax. The SSA and the revenue support grant are essential to that calculation. Unless we deal with inequalities, we shall not be able to deal with the Minister's admission on 6 November. I shall paraphrase the hon. Gentleman. He said that he was giving substantial additional resources to authorities on the basis that if they did not spend up to the level of services that the Government believe they require, the Government would give them additional funding which they could pass to another precepting authority—in this case, the non-metropolitan counties—to reduce their bills. At the same time in metropolitan areas such as the one I represent, there will be a substantial withdrawal of resources. The debate is about the grotesquely unfair redistribution of resources. I have tried desperately to explain why I am in order. I am sure that you, Mr. Leadbitter, would be the first to call me to order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come back to this subject later in the Bill and in the run-up to the general election. Ordinary people who live in inner-city areas and urban areas in the north, the midlands and the east midlands cannot for the life of them understand why they are financially penalised after they have provided resources and the quality of service that is required by the Department of the Environment while next door to them a Conservative authority which has not provided service up to the required standard is millions of pounds to the good.

I know Brixton from having been down there during the Vauxhall by-election. Some parts of my constituency are in just as much need as some parts of Lambeth. The hon. Gentleman should get out of his leafy part of Wandsworth and come down to where it is really at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman accepts that invitation, I must question whether he will find there the negative amount that will be set at nil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly shall. I was seeking to find it in the same way as the hon. Member for Makerfield, which seems the appropriate way. I want to respond to the intervention of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) by saying that he should be congratulated on choosing a flat in Wandsworth and then telling me about Brixton. I have a flat in Vauxhall—the borough that includes Brixton—so perhaps I know a little more about the matter than he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate to compare Lambeth with Wandsworth and Merton with Croydon; why did not the hon. Member for Makerfield compare Merton with Croydon? Those two outer-London boroughs have similar needs. The hon. Gentleman is not comparing like with like in tabling the amendment. London boroughs have been treated fairly in accordance with their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by answering the specific point raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). There are deep social problems in Wandsworth. They are every bit as bad as in Lambeth. But there is one difference: a comparison of the social indices at the beginning of the 1970s for the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth would show that they were pretty much equal. The difference is that Wandsworth has had three successive Conservative councils. They have tackled the social problems, privatised services and increased the level of local provision. They have used their capital receipts to improve the council estates in the Wandsworth area, but one would not expect the Opposition to acknowledge those improvements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) made some good points, one of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>693</span>
the most important being that the system is grotesquely unfair. The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) must recognise that. In such a grotesquely unfair system it is difficult for authorities that wish, from the best of intentions, to provide good services. They get blocked all the way. However, authorities that do not give a jot for the people in their area and do not want to spend any money get amendments such as this to help them, in effect, to break the law and avoid providing services that meet the legal standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the hon. Gentleman correctly? Did he say that the Labour authority of Lambeth had the best of intentions? I did not think that even the Labour party believed that any more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour authorities overall are keen to improve services. We all know that Labour authorities are prepared to spend more and send out slightly higher bills, whereas Conservative authorities do not want to spend money on services because they want their taxpayers to have lower bills. That is the difference. The grotesque distortion and unfairness to which my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) has referred is that Government fiddling of the system has caused the bills in Labour authorities to become huge. As a result, services have been damaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give another example. Wigan has to provide social services for people aged between 18 and 64 for £19·59 per head. That amount will have to be reduced even further after last week's statement. By contrast, a borough such as Wandsworth will have more than £52 per head to provide broadly similar services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes his point very effectively. That underlines how well Wandsworth has been treated. We all know that that good treatment is an electoral ploy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Elements of repetition are creeping in. Opposition Members are unable to understand or recognise that Wandsworth receives less money than other, comparable boroughs. The figures are publicly available. The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) must at least acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is about nil bills. How can the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) justify a nil bill in Wandsworth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Are we back to the community charge? If so, what is the relevance of the amendment? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will stick to the amendment. With a degree of ingenuity, he can explore all sorts of matters, but I should prefer him to remember the amendment from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would allow the possiblity of a nil bill in the poll tax to be carried over into the setting of a negative council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 6 November, the Minister stated in a written answer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under our council tax proposals some district councils, because of prudent housekeeping, are likely to receive more redistributed non-domestic rates and revenue support grant than they wish to spend."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 November 1991; Vol 198, c. 	<i>160.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Average expenditure in metropolitan authorities for the provision of primary education is £1,555 per head. My
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>694</span>
authority reduced that last year to £1,400 per pupil, yet suffered a reduction of millions of pounds in its revenue support grant. If the provision of services at lower cost than Department of the Environment estimates is good, why does the same thing for primary school children in Wigan cause resources to be cut?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend again makes the point about the grotesque unfairness of the system very well. It is just as unfair in London. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis), who may care to explain how a council such as Wandsworth can charge a nil bill for the not very good services that it provides. How can that be fair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me help to keep the hon. Gentleman within your happy picture of our discussion, Mr. Leadbitter. I shall refer to the word nil, which also appears in the amendment and which is pertinent to what has happened this year in Wandsworth ahead of the introduction of the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Conservative party took over the management of the London borough of Wandsworth, efficiency savings of £50 million have been made. That can be set against the cost of services. By contrast, each refuse collector in the London borough of Southwark, for example, collects 1 tonne of refuse per day. In Wandsworth, each collector picks up 4 tonnes of refuse, that is a better service at lower cost. Therefore, when the cost of local government is, say, £136 per head and the Chancellor in his wisdom gives every council in the country £140 per head, it is easy to see how a zero charge emerges. That is good housekeeping and good management and is typical of Conservative local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating the council tax, but many local authorities, in London and elsewhere, could point to £50 million of savings made in a similar period of time. However, they have not been rewarded in the way that Wandsworth has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pertinent point remains: Wandsworth has to run children's homes, education, and even some council housing. It also has to employ staff in all sorts of jobs. The hon. Gentleman claims that people in Wandsworth can finance those commitments, but they do not have to pay anything towards them. The hon. Gentleman's argument falls down because the Government will pay Wandsworth's local bills. But the Government will not pay the bills anywhere else, not even in other Tory areas. Windsor and Maidenhead had very high bills, for example. Some Tory councillors resigned when they realised that the Government were paying the bills in Wandsworth but not in Maidenhead. That is not fair. Of course councils will be popular if they set a nil rate for the council tax. If people get something for nothing, it is better than value for money, but it is not sensible or fair when compared with other local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman followed through the logic of his argument? If the Government were to say that when a local authority becomes particularly efficient and generates the remarkable savings that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) has outlined they would reduce by a proportionate amount the revenue support grant so that local authorities would not benefit from the savings that they generate by their own good management but would have those savings
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>695</span>
appropriated by central Government, no local authority would have any inducement to make any savings. What basis for the good management of local government would that principle establish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course local authorities should benefit from any savings that they make, but apart from Wandsworth, no other authorities have benefited in the amount of revenue support grant settlement they receive when they have made savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend would care to reflect on our proposal that authorities should not receive revenue support grant for services that they do not provide. That would mean that an authority such as Wandsworth would be in a very different position: it would not have to restore social spending services after a disaster but would have to spend them in the first place on preventive measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is a good point. It brings us back to the standard spending assessment that the Government propose to change. I believe that last week I quoted the example of Gloucester. That authority receives a grant for children under five in its SSA, yet it has no homes or nurseries for children under five. They are provided for privately, yet the council receives a grant. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield has already pointed out that SSAs are unfair and do not provide equality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are happy to talk about the nil bill, because it is popular, but the Minister should explain how it can be justified when set against other authorities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield said, a system that permits a nil council tax bill to be set is grotesquely unfair. It is all too easy for the Minister to comment on the popular aspect of that, but he should tackle the unfairness between local authorities. That is his responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue. The unfairness lies not only in the fact that some people would levy a nil bill, which means that some people would not be contributing for services, but in the method used to arrive at that situation. Some unscrupulous authorities budget for maximum spending at their SSAs and receive the grants that go with them and then find that their expenditure is nothing near that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point well. It highlights the unfairness in the system. That key point was made in an earlier exchange about value for money. That is relevant to the setting of a nil bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) compared people's bills with the services provided in terms of value for money. He said that the Audit Commission compared the service to the bill. That is not a fair measure of value for money across the board. A fair measure should take into account that needs differ from area to area, as my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield said when comparing Brixton with the leafy glades of Putney. A fair measure would take into account the difficulties faced by local authorities, and consider the provision of the services against their cost. The bill should not come into that measure of value for money. The bill reflects the fiddle of the SSA and other distortions in the system that take place afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>696</span>
Before we discuss nil bills, let there be a proper, independent measure of value for money for every local authority, setting provision against cost and taking into account local factors that might have a bearing on it. Grant should be allocated, and political arguments advanced, on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend said; he may want to incorporate my remarks in his argument. Is it not remarkable that under the comprehensive, universal capping powers, the Government are imposing on local authorities absolute limits on spending and on the delivery of services? They seem completely uninterested in the minimum provision of services. If we accept that Government should have such wide and draconian powers, we must ask why they are not directed to the provision of minimum services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. The Government are probably capping authorities that provide value for money. The Audit Commission, if asked to judge performance on the criterion of value for money, would say, "Yes, you are doing all right in terms of value for money in comparison with other authorities." That, however, is irrelevant to the Government. They will cap authorities on different criteria, and that cannot be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's press statement of 6 November congratulated local authorities for being prudent in the matter of asset sales, which would be taken into account when allocating grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Metropolitan authorities such as mine can be congratulated for their prudent disposal of assets. Those asset sales are reflected in the council's balances, but the Secretary of State attacks those balances when SSA calculations are made. My authority has done badly because it has been prudent and sold assets. The Government do not say, "Use that to improve services." They withdraw millions of pounds of resources from the authority so that there is no benefit from the sale of assets. The authority is penalised for being what the Government say it should be—prudent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Some local authorities could sell assets to achieve a nil balance. That is in line with the Government's privatisation policy. Those authorities would benefit from selling all their children's and old people's homes under the Government's proposals to achieve a nil council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to raise the matter of balances. I went to Orkney and Shetland on holiday—their political control is irrelevant. The Shetland authority has such enormous balances, built up over years, that it does not need a revenue support grant. It has a tradition of spending less than would be regarded as necessary to meet minimal standards. Authorities such as Shetland will now be able to set nil bills. They might even benefit from a grant under the new system, because they will be able to utilise their large balances. Some authorities in London will not be able to utilise balances in that way, because they do not have enormous balances that have been built up over the years but have to meet great needs. Nil bills are unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. gentleman is confusing the provision of services to an adequate and required level with the spending of money to an adequate and required level. The issue is straightforward. Good quality services can be provided at a lower cost. One should forget about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>697</span>
minimum spending and think about minimum services. I am pleased that Wandsworth is able to have a higher level of cover of social workers looking after children than the inner-London average, but that does not mean that an authority has to spend up to the inner-London average on that service. Quality of service is important, not cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we want quality of service. We also want value for money, so let us have a fair measure of value for money for all local authorities. Fair criteria should be set, and grant should be allocated on the basis of quality of service and good value for money. The Government are not interested in that. Their only criterion for allocating grant, giving rewards and allocating authorities to set nil budgets is low spending. Value for money and quality of service are not considered. They are encouraging authorities to break the law. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham said that minimum standards are not being met. Many of those are legal minimum standards, but the Government will turn a blind eye, as with Sunday shopping laws, for political expediency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises issues about statutory core services. Although there is a provision in law for basic statutory services, it is not set out in law what has to be done to meet those services. Local authorities are increasingly being asked to meet their statutory responsibilities by providing the least possible services that can be provided. The reality of meeting needs in that way does not fit the statutory responsibility but suits legislation such as this. We should assess the needs of every authority, whether Wandsworth or Wigan, and establish what is required for minimum needs to be met. In that way, we shall not end up with a system in which Wandsworth gets paid in its revenue support grant settlement for a service that it does not even provide. Wigan may provide that service, but because it does so it is capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a telling point: authorities get resources for services that they do not provide. Of course, then they can set nil bills. That is the grotesque unfairness referred to by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a decade of political manoeuvering so that the preserve of Wandsworth council can provide its nil bill. Under the council tax some authorities will be able to provide a nil bill, and that fact will be used for election purposes. Nil bills have resulted in significant cuts in services such as child care. Because the system has been fiddled, some local authorities have been able to maintain their services and those that have to pay much more find that there is no substantial difference. Core services have held up, although some authorities perhaps break the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there are nil bills, there will be nil services. There will be no child care and elderly people will be neglected. The fiddles can maintain services for only a brief period but, ultimately, nil services will follow nil bills, and that is what the Government want. That is why they must justify their proposals. Although the proposals may be popular in electoral terms, how can they be fair to those who need the services and to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those of us who can remember the beginning of the debate on the amendments will agree that the contribution of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) was a model of brevity and relevance. I have been taunted by my hon. Friends to speak to the amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>698</span>
and I shall try to do so while attempting to deal swiftly with as many as possible of the issues raised by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comments of Labour Members may have been a little wide of the mark in dealing with an important and wide-ranging debate on standard spending assessments. Most of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) were answered more than adequately by my hon. Friends the Members for Battersea (Mr. Bowis), for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) who made excellent contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the intervention of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who spoke of a lack of reference to quality of service. The hon. Gentleman wants it both ways. We constantly hear that we are imposing new statutory demands on local authorities in respect of the provision of services. There are references to the minimum standards that should be provided, but I accept that there are not enough of them. That is why the Local Government Bill in another place provides for the standard of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman sure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks whether I am sure. I am confident that even faster progress will be made. The Labour party shot itself in the foot last night by voting against the clause that included 50 of its prized amendments. Labour Members will now be deprived of an opportunity to debate them in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Under-Secretary agrees that even faster progress will be made if the other place continues to dismember the Local Government Bill at the current rate. If a third of the Bill has gone and the remaining bits are voted down, nothing will be left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a romantic view of the ambush that occurred last night. I believe that the Labour party managed to muster 66 of their lordships into turning up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The other place will be quite unhappy. Until now it has been quite pleased with itself. May we get on with debating the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am properly called to order, Mr. Leadbitter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) made important points, one of which was about metropolitan districts and passenger transport authorities. The difficulties with the PTAs, levies and district budgets to which he referred arise only when districts overspend their SSAs. That will be dealt with in the debate on amendment No. 261, so I shall leave PTAs until that more appropriate time. No doubt, my hon. Friend the Minister will satisfy the Committee on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) warned me that he would have to leave early. He raised several highly political and contentious points. I was grateful to him for waking up the Committee. Yes, I want to encourage local authorities to be low-spending authorities. I do not regard that as a horror scenario, as he clearly does. It is for local authorities to determine how they wish to meet their statutory requirements and what other needs of their communities they wish to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seemed to find democracy uncomfortable and totally foreign to his argument. If people vote for local authorities that spend less, that is their right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say how democracy and accountability are assisted by an authority that has sold assets to raise revenue so as to have a negative rate of local tax and then provides a subsidy for another authority whose electors are uncertain about which element of the budget provided by the other authority they are voting for and what changes are taking place in that budget and expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people paying the tax are one and the same. They live in a geographical areas that happens to have two tiers of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not know who to blame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has hit the nail on the head. That is why we are keen to encourage, where appropriate, the creation of unitary authorities. That would answer the accountability question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to begin by agreeing with the Under-Secretary on the desirability of having unitary authorities, but I take him back to his point about local democracy. Why is it a wonderful manifestation of local democracy for a local authority to put before its electorate plans to cut spending and services, which voters might endorse, but not for it to put before its electorate, and receive support for, proposals to invest in improved nursery school provision, meals on wheels or a new nature reserve? I was at Camley street natural park yesterday, which is an excellent example of a nature reserve supported by the local authority. Why is that form of spending put out of court by the Government's capping plans? Surely that is a total denial of the local democracy on which the Under-Secretary bases his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman changes his ground mid-sentence; he began by talking about SSAs and the level of spending and ended by talking about capping. To come back to the point, it is not mutually exclusive to provide services at low cost. The Labour party fails to recognise that fact time and again. It is not necessarily so that low-spending, efficient local authorities provide services that are either below the statutory requirement or unacceptable to the electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press on, but of course I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is always pleasant to me until he answers. My authority is as he described—it is low spending, it gives value for money, it provides core services at a cost below the average of other metropolitan authorities, including inner-London authorities, but it is capped. That authority does precisely what the Government tell it to do to prevent capping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that the authority will deal with that problem when it considers the capping criteria recently announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It may want to discuss the matter with us should it fall within those criteria. There would be an interesting discussion, as we always have with the hon. Gentleman and his council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield perceives a reduction in the resources allocated to local authorities. The facts do not support that. Spending on local authorities was £19,307 million in 1980–81 and £39,892 million in 1991–92,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>700</span>
an increase in cash terms of 107 per cent. and in real terms of 5 per cent. We should get rid of the myth that there has been a cut in the money given to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intrude, but when Ministers constantly refer to total standard spending or standard spending assessments—Ministers in the Department of Health and in the Department of the Environment are guilty of that—as though that is Government grant or aggregate external funding, they not only mislead the public but delude themselves. If the Under-Secretary believes that what he has said is true, he is fundamentally deluding himself and he cannot be aware of the damage that the Government have done to services or of the true burden that his Department inflicts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course what I said is true. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman questions it. We can look at all sorts of measures of local authority spending and argue at length about expenditure on various items, but it is misleading of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that there have been cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to answer the many points raised by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). If he finds when he reads 	<i>Hansard</i> that I have left out any of his questions, I hope that he will tell me* because any omission is not deliberate.

The hon. Gentleman said that some authorities have more RSG and NDR than they spent while others were capped. That shows a misunderstanding of the grant and capping regimes. Grant does not depend on an individual authority's decisions about its spending. Grants and national non-domestic rate depend on our assessment of spending levels in the standard spending assessments. If an authority chooses to spend less, that is a matter for that authority. An authority is capped if its budget is excessive or represents an excessive increase over the previous year's budget. That regime is to be continued under the council tax. Whether or not an authority is capped does not depend on its entitlement to RSG or NDR.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now tackling an interesting point. If a local authority regularly and consistently over two or three years availed itself of the provision that we are debating and produced a nil or negative amount of council tax, would that be taken into account in any subsequent calculations of SSA? In other words, from that point onwards, would the SSA continue to be applied in the ordinary way and would the money be pocketed and passed on in the way that the hon. Gentleman proposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. One part of the argument is concerned with grants and the other with the level of spending. Those are two separate issues. The hon. Gentleman's logic seems to be that if, for example, a local authority uses its reserves, its external finance should be cut. If that is what he is saying, I find it extraordinary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: am grateful to the Under-Secretary for responding on the matters which I raised. I quoted from a news release issued by the Department of the Environment, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under our council tax proposals some district councils, because of prudent housekeeping, are likely to receive more redistributed non-domestic rates (NDR) and Revenue Support Grant (RSG) than they wish to spend."</p></blockquote>
If that will not happen, what does it mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The technical paper containing equations and examples to which the hon. Gentleman referred was discussed at the settlements working group by officers of the associations and by my officials. It simply showed how the formulae in the Bill would operate. The formulae in clauses 33 to 36 provide for the calculation of billing authorities' taxes; clauses 44 to 47 provide the same for precepting authorities. The formulae are not especially confusing— even I managed to follow them—but they are complex. In discussing the formulae with local authority officers, we try to make them as clear as possible so that they can be readily understood and implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the Government were biased against local authorities that want to provide services in favour of those that do not want to do so—a point made regularly by the hon. Member for Leyton. The Government are not biased. Grant is paid to each local authority according to our assessment of the cost of providing a standard level of service—the basis of the SSA. It does not depend on what the local authority chooses to spend. The important point is that authorities are treated exactly the same, whether they choose to be economical and spend at a level below the SSA or whether they choose to spend at a higher level, above the SSA. That criterion applies even if a local authority chooses a level of spending below its grant and below its non-domestic rate entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why money was not paid to counties or other authorities in the first place. He suggested that we should redirect RSG and the NDR, which would go to the nil tax authorities from the start. That suggestion is based on a misunderstanding. We do not know the local authorities' budgets before the grant settlement, so we do not know which districts will be nil tax authorities. When it is clear that an authority is in that position, there is a choice between asking it to give its grant entitlement back to the Exchequer or allowing it to be used to offset the county precept. We have chosen the second route, which is fairer to the council tax payer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take the Under-Secretary back a couple of sentences. I am doing my best to follow what he is saying and it takes me a second or two to recover from my astonishment at some of his proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to measure degrees of implausibility in what the Under-Secretary says and I want to be sure that he is as implausible as I believe. Is he saying that a local authority that can charge a negative amount of council tax will deliver nevertheless, the same level of services? Is the hon. Gentleman asserting that the fact that it can level no council tax or actually hand money to another precepting authority is entirely due to prudent housekeeping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> If that is not the hon. Gentleman's position, is he conceding my hon. Friend's point, that it happens because a lower level of service is delivered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, of course not. The local authorities have a variety of sources of income. We do not know what those sources are or the amount that they will generate. We are talking not just about a few Conservative authorities—a Labour authority might levy a nil tax. Until the other sources of income are known, we cannot tell which will be nil tax authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>702</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are these other sources, apart from interest receipts on assets and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good example and I shall give others. When there is a large-scale voluntary transfer of housing, the proceeds are used initially to redeem debt and the amount left can be invested to generate income. That income can be considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an authority that owns a large shopping centre, from which it derives substantial rent income. That income helps enormously towards its district expenditure. That is another example, and there are many such examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that example, £3 million is raised for the authority. Why are the Government intent on stopping that authority taking part in such a partnership, to raise revenue for the public purse, and on forbidding other authorities from investing in similar joint ventures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must mean that we naturally have reservations about local authorities being commercial bodies, with the same trading position as a private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton also referred to benefit and nil tax—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves my point about transferring resources to the countries or metropolitan districts, I wish to say that when I referred to the formula for revenue support grant, I meant the number of people in need of community care—the number of elderly people and mentally disabled people who have to be cared for by the authorities. I was also referring to care for the elderly and to nursery school places. The Department has that information. More resources should be given to those authorities that have to reduce those important services, because they fear capping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course local authorities have statutory duties to perform, but I think that, again the hon. Gentleman is confusing the issue of what expenditure the local authority means to undertake and where that money comes from. It is by no means as simple as the hon. Gentleman has said. The matter relates directly to the hon. Gentleman's subsequent point about benefits and nil tax. He asked whether benefit would be paid in appropriate circumstances; that illustrates another misunderstanding, which I shall attempt to clear up. Our proposal will enable a nil tax district to reduce the overall local tax payable in its area; it will be the county precept, reduced by the grant and the national non-domestic rate left over after meeting district spending. With a county precept of, for example, £350 for a band D house, the eventual tax might be reduced by £50 to £300. Benefits and discounts will be calculated on the actual amount of tax payable—£300. There is no question of there being wasteful benefit expenditure. The proposal will, if anything, save money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to the two precepting authorities—the district and the county. What about the parish? That is another precepting authority. A few weeks ago, the Minister and I spent some time with representatives of local authority associations. Financing is obviously important to them. As I understand it—perhaps the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong—parishes precept on a district. If there is surplus non-domestic rate and revenue support grant, will that also benefit parish councils? Will they also have a negative bill? That is very important and will depend on the amount of precept that is levied by parishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>703</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right about parishes. A parish will not have a separate negative tax in such circumstances, because its precept is wrapped up with that of the district. The only difference that will show on a council tax payer's bill will be the tax payable to the collecting district and the amount due to any other precepting authority. The parish is included in the district and it will not be shown separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point in connection with nil bills. Under the Bill, the parishes expect to receive the same revenue support grant and non-domestic rate as they received under the poll tax. The formulae that we have been given show how payment from the pool is made to parish and town councils according to how much they levy. Will the bill that is sent to council tax payers in parish areas identify separately the proportion of pool money that town and parish councils receive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parishes have never received revenue support grant or non-domestic rate directly. That will not change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is important, because the poll tax formula includes revenue support grant and non-domestic rate as well as the district rate, the county rate and the parish rate. All those elements are totalled up, and a parish council that levies a £10 per head poll tax gets the same proportion of RSG and NDR as the district and county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a proportional sum. The parish gets precisely what it requests from the district. Parishes have never received a direct budget through the system and we do not suggest that they should. A parish gets what it decides that it needs direct from the district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about revenue support grant? When we were discussing the poll tax Bill, I received a letter from the Yorkshire Local Councils Association, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any Parish or Town Council issuing a precept after 1990 should receive an amount from the business calculated in proportion to the amount of non-domestic rate received under the system prior to that date"—</p></blockquote>
the old rating system. Under that system, the parishes could precept on the industrial and commercial premises in their area and receive the benefit. I do not have the poll tax formula with me, but I am sure that it can be produced. That formula provided that the parish and town councils received part of the non-domestic rate and the revenue support grant. However, the Under-Secretary has said that those councils have never received that money. That will cause much anxiety in the parish, town and community councils and England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary is unable to confirm the position, I hope that he will give us further information about this matter, as it carries a great deal of weight in the communities. The parish councils are the first line of democracy, and we should have some information on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three messages which I have just received from the heavens may not be manna, but they confirm what I have said. The hon. Gentleman knows that I always try to be helpful. If he will let me see the letter from the Yorkshire Local Councils Association—it has not written to me about this matter—I shall give a direct response to the points that it raises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to correspondence that I received in 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>704</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see. The letter is from an old file and is not relevant to today's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is relevant, but not current.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled at the spectacle of three pieces of paper wending their way to the Under-Secretary at short intervals. Each time he received one, he said exactly the same thing. Does he expect us to believe that his officials regard him as so infirm of purpose and uncertain of his facts that they have to send him three separate bits of paper in three minutes—and a fourth is now arriving—each saying the same thing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the answer is that officials have enormous confidence in me. I have received a communication that invites me to suggest that they want to go back to local business rates. That does not alter what I said about parish councils. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to delve into a particular point about Yorkshire, I should be pleased to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am coming to the end of my remarks and I hope that I have managed to answer most of the points raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has not started to answer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was out of the Room at the time. When he reads 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that I have answered many of his points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being absent, but I had to leave the Room for an urgent telephone call. I shall read 	<i>Hansard</i> and then arrange to visit the Under-Secretary and the Minister, along with 72 councillors from Wigan, all of whom are rugby league players.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to point out now what I have missed. Being a rugby union man, I might find that prospect daunting, but I shall listen to the hon. Gentleman. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am invited to comment on the hon. Gentleman's tie, but that may be a little wide of the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on parishes could be solved if the Under-Secretary and his colleagues would make a statement of intent that they do not wish to interfere with expenditure, with performance or with the delivery of services of parish councils. When invited to do that on the Floor of the House, the answers were so negative and ambiguous that the National Association of Parish Councils was even more worried than it was before. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would like to use this moment to state that the Government have no intention of bringing into play the expenditure of parish councils or of proceeding with clause 54(5), which I understand may be the subject of future debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by that intervention. The hon. Member for Normanton and I recently visited the beautiful city of York to address the National Association of Local Councils. The reception given to both of us was positive. Certainly, I received a positive response to my positive speech; I did not have the pleasure of listening to the hon. Gentleman because we both had late trains to catch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made positive progress. Only yesterday I received from the National Association of Local Councils a written and formal response to the invitation that I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>705</span>
issued in York regarding our various consultations with local government. I look forward to considering how we can act on that. There is no doubt that we treat the larger town councils and the parish councils with great respect. We have invited them to suggest ways in which their role may develop within the process of consultation on the structure of local government and internal management which has just finished. The rather vicious remarks of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) were quite out of character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would remove the ability of authorities to use surplus RSG and NDR to offset the county precept for their areas. As I explained, the Bill does no more than preserve the current position by continuing to allow RSG and NDR to be used to reduce local taxes. The amendments would not permit authorities to pay a dividend to the council tax payer. In the rate event that anything were left after offsetting the entire county precept, the money would remain in a billing authority's collection fund to offset council tax in future years. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment briefly on the negative billing of parish and town councils. We are told that there will be no contribution to the precept levied by parish and town councils on the districts for the benefit of their council tax payers. I assume that, for the purpose of financing parish and town councils, a tax will be levied on properties. A small amount will be added to the bill sent to council tax payers and it will depend on the band into which their property falls. Parish and town councils will be allowed the money raised through the district bill. Council tax payers will be notified of the sum that they are paying for parish and town council purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in parish and town council areas will be disappointed that they are not to receive benefit from RSG or NDR. That will attract the wrath of various associations. Will the Under-Secretary reconsider? He reaffirmed the consultation offer made at York. That is healthy and will give people the opportunity to raise the issue of support from RSG and NDR.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I right about the raising of funds for parish and town councils? Will they levy a precept according to the bands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is not quite right. Parishes levy a lump sum precept on a district and the district converts that into a tax amount, depending upon the band.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the bills for each band show the amounts that people pay to parish and town councils? Will that be shown as separate amounts? Will that system demonstrate the accountability of parish and town councils in levying a global amount on their districts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The preamble to the Bill says that some measure of accountability should be demonstrated in council tax payers' bills. Will the amount paid for parish and town council purposes show up on a bill, as it does on the poll tax bill now? There must be some responsibility. Parish councils may say that they want £50,000 and the district council may distribute that sum across various levels of expenditure. But will the amount paid by parish and town councils on the bands set in the legislation show on the parish precept?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had to wait a long time for that answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>706</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I immediately concede that my hon. Friend knows a great deal more about parish council finances than I do, but I am not sure whether the percepted amount shown on each bill will be the same amount or whether it will be proportionately distributed according to the size of the bill and the band of the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume from what the Under-Secretary said that it will rest with the level of the different bands. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will answer my hon. Friend's question because this is not my Bill, but I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, some hon. Members received a briefing from the Association of District Councils. That briefing is now relevant because the press release refers to district and county councils. The briefing refers to grant aspects. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since an average of 85 per cent. of local spending is to be funded by central Government grants of some form including the share of the national non-domestic rate and grant is once again to be identified with separate tiers of local government, then the need to review Government spending assessments—the SSAs—for district councils becomes imperative."</p></blockquote>
That statement is made not by me or by my colleagues but by the Association of District Councils. We support the association's view that, when we consider the formulae for allocating grants, including NDR there should be a review of the SSAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That relevant point was made earlier. When councils have a nil bill for council tax, the level of service is under question. The Association of District Councils supports that contention by saying that it is imperative that the SSAs should be reviewed under the formulae. The briefing states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In particular, the association will wish to see the SSAs for districts constructed in a more detailed way, taking separate account of the more important services or groups of services with similar features and recognising the real practice which lead to different levels of spending."</p></blockquote>
That is the point which we made earlier. Our amendment would help to meet the association's requests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman says about the association's views. On parishes, I have in mind that the information will show the proportion of district spending that is the parish precept. Would the hon. Gentleman like me to think about the matter further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will drop me a line on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the points which have have been made and the assurances given, and because the issue has generated a great deal of concern among all hon. Members, I request that the Question be put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
