	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 1, in page 5, line 16, leave out "new Board's functions" and insert
	<br><q><p>"functions mentioned in whichever of subsections (1) to (4) above has effect in relation to that new Board".—[	<i>Mr. Renton.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Arts (Mr. Tim Renton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have so far made good progress on this important Bill. However, for the pleasure of the Committee I should say a few words about clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of this well informed Committee will know, the Bill has been eagerly awaited by the national gallery, the Tate gallery, the national portrait gallery and the Wallace collection for many years. I am hopeful that, after the considerate treatment given the Bill on Second Reading, we shall continue to make good progress this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those four galleries are governed by a range of legislation, Treasury minutes and deeds. The bill will supersede that governing legislation and replace it with explicit legislation that is modelled on the National Heritage Act 1983. It will establish new corporate boards of trustees along the lines of the Victoria and Albert and the science museums. The Bill tidies up a good deal of convention, and the interpretation of previous Acts and instruments that deal with the duties, responsibilities, powers and proceedings of the trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incorporation of the four boards of trustees will also ensure that the trustees of the four galleries are no longer personally liable when entering into contracts for the supply of goods and services, and also employment. The trustees' liability will be put on the same footing as that for other national museums and galleries. As I said, not only the trustees but the directors and staff of those four galleries who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
work so hard and well welcome the Bill and hope to see it enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want to provide the galleries with explicit legislation setting out their general functions. The subsections in clause 2 dealing with individual boards have therefore been framed with particular reference to the activities of each gallery. Clause 2 specifies that the general functions of each new board are to maintain, exhibit and grant access to its collection and to promote public understanding and enjoyment of the art with which a collection is associated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards are also empowered to provide education, enter into contracts and acquire and dispose of land and other property. As land is a public asset, the power to acquire and dispose of it is subject to Government consent. The clause also enables the new boards to do what is necessary in pursuit of their functions. The reason is simply that the Government want them to have the requisite powers to manage their collections most effectively. Thus, the clause enables them to charge for admission to their permanent collections and special exhibitions if they so wish and to charge for any goods or services provided by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the Government may decide from time to time that certain Government functions are best carried out by the galleries because of their specialist knowledge. Subsection 2(7) therefore provides that a Minister may direct a new board to carry out functions exerciseable by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also provides new boards with the power to provide facilities for others and thus to generate revenue. In that context I shall say another brief word about charging for admission. It is Government policy that national museums and galleries should have the power to charge for admission if they so wish. However, I stress that there is no obligation on them to charge. The decision to charge is a matter for the board of trustees responsible for each institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the power to charge is not new in respect of these four galleries. As unincorporated trustees, they are already empowered to charge for admission by common law. The Bill merely sustains those powers for the new incorporated boards. The point is sometimes made—not least by Opposition Members—that the Government are trying to force the galleries into making admission charges to supplement the inadequate funding which they receive. In answer to that, the Government's record shows that they are committed to maintaining their support for museums and galleries while encouraging them to develop greater independence and self-reliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Revenue raised from admission charges is kept by the national museums and galleries and is then used to improve facilities for visitors—for example, better catering facilities, access for the disabled, signposting and so on. In the financial year 1990–91 the national museums raised more than £7 million from admission charges, and £48 million from all types of self-engendered income in the year just ending. That £48 million compares with £28 million three years ago, and it represents 21 per cent of museums' total
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
income. That is an important addition to the total revenue of the museums and galleries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides an explicit statement of the new boards' functions. It gives them the requisite powers to carry out those functions, and I recommend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say that Opposition Members are glad that you, Mr. Hogg, are in the Chair, as proceedings later this morning contain pertinent Scottish questions that will be of considerable personal interest? The Committee also welcomes the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland to the Committee. We are sure that he will not be surprised if the Committee applies hard and rigorous scrutiny to his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In broad terms, we support the powers given in the clause, but simply stating those powers covers only half the problem. The powers and duties given to national museums—to care for, preserve, and add to their collections, exhibitions, study and research, and to promote understanding—are admirable and essential to fulfil what society expects from these four great national collections. However, if the Government want to impose that duty, it also requires them to provide the means for the four collections, so that their duties can be fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, if the Government are to fulfil their obligations, they must provide the means to ensure that the buildings are in good order; that they are adequately staffed with high quality people; and that funding and grant aid are substantial enough to allow the duties mentioned in the Bill to be carried out. Over all those areas, however, there are distinct question marks. The ambition embodied in the Bill is admirable, but it is doubtful whether the four collections will have adequate means to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been told many times that all four collections have very substantial fabric maintenance costs. The national gallery estimates that £20 million needs to be spent on buildings. The Tate gallery's estimate is £27 million. The Minister's ears must be continually ringing with the sound of people telling him that there are holes in the roof of the Tate gallery. It was built on foundations of marshy ground at Millbank, so it is crumbling. Its wiring is also deficient. These problems have been identified for the benefit of the Minister—or his predecessor—by the Public Accounts Committee report and the Museums and Galleries Commission report of 1988, yet the Government have done nothing about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So Opposition Members welcome the duties placed on museums by the Bill. However, it is very difficult for those duties to be fulfilled if the buildings in which people sit are inadequately maintained or crumbling. There will come a point when the Government will have to wake up to that. The two reports to which I referred highlighted problems in conservation, cataloguing and security. It is about time the Government recognised and dealt with those problems. Unless they do, all the fine words in the clause will be meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we allow this clause to stand part of the Bill, we must have some assurances from the Minister that there is sufficient will on the part of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Government to provide the means to fulfil the aspirations that the clause embodies. Specifically, the Minister should explain whether there is a change in Government policy. Earlier, in the 1980s, the Government's view was forthrightly put by Lord Gowrie—that museums and galleries should stand on their own two feet in the market. Is that still the Government's attitude? The present Minister has never made a definitive statement about museums. Does he believe that market forces should prevail? In his opening remarks, the Minister said that he was enthusiastic about income generation. Will that be the central thrust for the last few weeks of the Government's custody of museums; or is the increased funding of the previous year indicative of a slight change of policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause contains two main powers which the Committee should spend some time examining: the power to charge for admissions, and to raise income through other means. We deliberately chose not to table an amendment on the power of charging for admissions. The Committee and country know the strong differences between the two parties on this issue, so there is no need to rehearse them now. Because Opposition Members generally wish the Bill well in principle, we shall not obstruct its progress. It would not be for the greater edification of the Committee or the public to go over all the arguments again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, however, for Opposition Members to put on record the fact that museums have been pressured into charging admission fees, and that that has not been to the benefit either of museums or of the public. It has rather been simply a response to inadequate funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister has yet come across a director of a national museum who, having introduced charging, would say that he had wanted to, irrespective of levels of funding. All directors of national museums want the maximum number of people to enjoy, understand and be excited by their collections. There is no doubt that the introduction of charges reduced admissions. That cannot be good policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may well say in response that admissions have gradually picked up again. Of course they would. No one is saying that the initial level to which admissions dropped—an 80 per cent fall in the case of the national museum of Wales—will be constant. We rehearsed the arguments on the Floor of the House yesterday, and there is no need to go over them all again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members, however, believe strongly that charging for admissions is not a good thing. The Minister may say that there is no such obligation on the four museums, three of which, we are glad to say—the Tate, the national gallery and the national portrait gallery—have resisted the temptation to charge, but that is not good enough. If the Government continue to underfund national museums, as they do now, it will be difficult for trustees to carry on resisting the pressures to charge. They will have no alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
It is ironic that charging admissions, which is intended to generate income, generates income on the doors, but depresses income in other areas of a museum's activities. The Government have not adequately reflected on that. They have pointed to an increase in income generation in other areas, but the Minister knows perfectly well that evidence provided to the Select Committee a couple of years ago by Neil MacGregor of the national gallery suggests otherwise. He made it clear that if his trustees required him to charge for admission to the national gallery, income generated by the restaurant, cafeteria and shop would go down. So charging is a self-defeating mechanism to some extent, as decreasing the number of people entering the gallery by admission charges will decrease income elsewhere—in the very areas covered in the clause: sales of books, videos, reproductions and so on. As I said, the Government have never responded to the Select Committee report. They have an opportunity this morning to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(9) requires further scrutiny in relation to other possibilities for income generation. The Committee should consider what is happening in this respect in museums and galleries. Because the Government are underfunding them, museums have been required to consider alternative sources of income—for example, letting their premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different museums have a great variety of policies and enthusiasms, but generally a creeping policy is developing. I suspect that the public, and perhaps even the Minister, are not fully aware of it. I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the natural history museum, for example. Last year it earned £419,000 from letting the space in the museum for parties, receptions and the like. The Minister might say that that is a very good thing; but is it furthering the aims of the clause and of the national museums to use museum space for private functions such as 40th birthday parties, 21st birthday parties, bar mitzvahs and other such events? Does the Minister believe that that is making good use, in a way compatible with the aims and objectives of the clause, of the natural history museum's space—not least when we recall that smoking is allowed at private functions? Smoking is certainly not desirable in museums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that other national museums have a different policy. For example, the Tate lets for private functions only to corporate members. It has a corporate membership scheme which is run constructively to bring in corporate sponsorship; space is let only to members. That ties in more closely the commercial exploitation of the space in the evenings with the aims and objectives of the gallery. Lettings by other museums—for example the natural history museum and the science museum, which had 148 lettings last year, 88 of which were fee-paying—do not further the aims of the museums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Committee and the House to recognise what is happening in the interests of income generation. There is a danger that the Government are forcing museums to let their space to anyone, when they should be concentrating their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
resources on fulfilling the duties and responsibilities of promoting their collections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that there is no conflict and that income should be generated in any way possible, but there is no doubt that staff time is taken up in administering the lettings, and clearing up afterwards. Resources that are provided to fulfil the obligations and duties of the museums are being devoted to clearing up after 40th birthday parties and bar mitzvahs. If that is the Government's policy, they should make it clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there is way of resolving and balancing the issue. Thus far, different museums have evolved different policies. If the Government wish them to pursue this line, is it not an ideal subject for a ministerial circular offering guidelines to the museums, to augment and explain the powers in the clause: "You have the power to generate income and to let your space, but that should be done only in a way that fulfils the obligations of the museum; that does not mean private parties where there is smoking and it does not mean any form of letting."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say in reply that there is a case for a ministerial circular or guidelines to the museums amplifying the clause and limiting the types of income generation from sponsorship and evening events. We would welcome that, because it would represent a constructive use of a ministerial circular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John G. Blackburn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points to make on the clause, the first of which follows on from the comments of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher). I have had the opportunity half a dozen times of attending private functions, especially at the Tate gallery. I want the Committee to know that those functions were of a very high order, afforded us wonderful evenings, were controlled perfectly by the staff and provided a source of revenue. If the revenue from those private lettings is insufficient to cover the administration, light refreshments and clearing up afterwards, that is bad management. I cannot think of a lovelier way of spending an evening at a private function than at one of our wonderful galleries, bearing in mind that if they were not generating income at 7.30 pm they would be closed. I want them to use every legitimate and honourable means of generating funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee and the House know of the hon. Gentleman's great interest in and love for the Tate gallery in particular and for other museums. Does he agree that there is an enormous difference between the Tate gallery, which has considered the matter and lets only to corporate private sponsorship in the evenings, and other museums which let to anyone who is prepared to pay, regardless of whether that furthers the museums' aims?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Blackburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not subscribe to that. Museums should not be used simply as a venue. The longer that the debate continues, the more I find a bond of unity with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to my second point. I pay a warm and generous tribute to my right hon. Friend the Minister.

The Second Reading debate was one of the finest for a long time, and reflected great credit on all who took part. I am assured and convinced by, and grateful to, my right hon. Friend for his comments on clause 2(1)(b), which was on the theme that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) and myself debated on Second Reading, as to the need to ensure that works of art are exhibited to the public.

Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Blackburn) for his kind comments to me and to all members of the Committee in respect of the Second Reading debate. It was interesting, and covered a lot of ground. I hope that that will help the Committee to make expeditious progress in our detailed consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee will remember with pleasure the passion and knowledge with which my hon. Friend spoke, especially on the paintings of Turner—of which he is very fond and knowledgeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the last person to suggest that any collection of pictures or exhibition should be damaged by holding private parties in a gallery after hours, or that they should be damaged by smokers. However, I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, (Mr. Fisher), who leads for the Opposition, that we place great reliance on the decisions of the trustees, who are advised by the directors and their staff. One essence of the Bill is to formalise delegated responsibility to gallery trustees and directors. We should leave it to them to decide how they should organise such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I considered the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central for a ministerial circular, but I do not believe that there is a case for one. If it followed in the wake of the Bill, it would be considered to be ministerial intervention. However, if there were clear cases of rooms being used for unsuitable parties after hours, with smoking where there should not be smoking, I would certainly consider some central advice—if there seemed to be cause for that and if it would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that when the natural history museum lets space for bar mitzvahs or private dances and allows smoking on those occasions, that is a good and appropriate use of which he approves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the 15 months that I have been doing this very pleasant and very demanding job of Minister for the Arts—I thank my colleagues for their support—I have not been aware of any specific complaint about the use of such rooms. However, I repeat that if there were evidence of misuse, I would investigate the matter. Every member of the Committee has a common interest in seeing that the museums and galleries, which are part of our great national heritage, are used sensibly and intelligently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that, within reason, we should do all that we can to encourage—people who would not normally visit museums and galleries to do so. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
should approve if someone who would not normally visit the natural history museum or the science museum held a bar mitzvah there in the evening, when the museum would usually be closed, so long as he did so in a way approved by the director and his staff. That would bring in people who would not otherwise visit the museum. They would enjoy the museum's facilities, which might bring them back with their families for a serious visit on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, that crystallises the difference between the Government and the Opposition over the question of admission to museums and galleries. I do not want to stoke up flames of party-political passion on this amiable Tuesday morning. However, our approach to charging for admission has been to say to museums and galleries, "We encourage you to develop your external revenue. When you do so, you can keep it all; it will not be deducted from your grant in aid." That approach is part and parcel of or attempts to encourage museums and galleries to open their eyes more widely and to get away from the concept that all their funding will come from the state. They should consider other sources of revenue that they could reasonably use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that this is not the policy of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. I must emphasise the success of our policy in recent years. We reckon that £48 million will be raised this year in external revenue which compares with the £28 million raised three years ago. Museums and galleries will keep all of that money, which they could use to improve their visitors' facilities or to mount special exhibitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kernel of the hon. Gentleman's case lies in his comment that admission charges tend to decrease charges in other areas. I refer him to the experience of the Victoria and Albert museum last year, during its "Visions of Japan" exhibition. That museum does not charge for admission but it has a collection box and encourages people, fairly forcefully, to put, I think, £3.50 into it. It charged, I believe, £5 a head for the "Visions of Japan" exhibition, which earned the museum £140,000 straight profit. During the exhibition the average daily attendance to the museum rose from 2,800 in the same period the previous year to 3,770, which is an increase of 30 per cent. That means that 30 per cent more people went through the regular halls of the V and A and visited its restaurant and shop, which gives the lie to the case of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. Charging for a good exhibition attracts more people, who will use the other facilities, which may be free or for which there may be a charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making a false and rather disingenuous point. Of course attendance rose during the "Visions of Japan" exhibition. That was not because there was a charge for the exhibition but because it was an additional attraction. It was an excellent exhibition. People were drawn to it because it was new and because we have hitherto been closed to Japanese culture. People will go to a wonderful exhibition like that even if they have to pay; they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
have always been willing to pay for the privilege of going to special exhibitions. Many of them will stay on and look at the museum's core collection and at its other galleries. That does not mean, however, that they stayed on because of the charge; the two points are completely separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he did not want to wind up the Opposition over this important point, yet he has succeeded in doing so. Despite the rather bland and mellifluous words with which he described income generation, the Government are saying that national museums should flog off their space as a venue for the use of whoever is able to pay. A couple of years ago the V and A ran an advertising campaign along the lines: "Ace cafe, and a nice museum too".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman seems to have forgotten that he is making an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple fact is that these functions take place out of the public eye. They bring in extra receipts without affecting in any way the needs of the museum-going public. Those receipts are put into areas that fulfil the museum's aims. If the V and A did not have a policy of charging for such exhibitions it would not have been able to put on the "Visions of Japan" exhibition in the first place. It was expensive to mount, and the museum needed to be certain that it would bring in increased revenue. It attracted many more visitors to the V and A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the general funding that the Government made available to museums and galleries. I am pleased to confirm the announcement that I made last year—£117 million will be available for next year's running costs of the national museums and galleries. That is an increase of 5.5 per cent on this year's figure. It is being granted against a background of falling inflation. I also made special one-off allocations of £1.64 million for priority projects identified by the national museums and galleries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, like my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham (Sir R. Luce), am concerned about building and maintenance. My right hon. Friend deserves full credit for ensuring that there is more money going each year to the national museums and galleries for their capital improvement building and maintenance programmes. My right hon. Friend achieved a cash rise of over £23 million, which is an increase of 67 per cent. In the years immediately ahead, we shall put over £60 million a year into repairs and maintenance. For 1994–95, we shall provide £67 million. You will be astonished to hear, Mr. Hogg, that that represents a real-terms increase of 116 per cent since 1979–80.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will always be more work to do on buildings, as every member of the Committee will appreciate. A lot of the buildings are old and big, and there will always be roofs to repair. I am delighted that we have made such a substantial start on that important work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The differences between the Government and the Opposition have been emphasised during our debate. I suspect that the Labour party sees museums and galleries as a rather closed world. That is rather like
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
its view of the history of socialism, which is preserved and ossified in Walworth road. We, on the other hand, see the museums and galleries in an open way. They should always be trying to attract new people and they should establish what additional funding can be raised for that purpose. They will always be strongly supported by the Government and by public funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF THE NEW BOARDS TO FORM COMPANIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause will ensure that the new boards have the power to carry out relevant activities as efficiently as possible. It will provide them with powers to form companies to carry out those functions. It will enable each new board to form or to take part in the formation of a company, with the Government's assent. The activities will range from production and sale—of books, films, informative material relating to the fields of art with which the board is involved, replicas or reproductions of works of art, and souvenirs—to the provision of catering or other services. The clause would enable the new boards—this is important—to give financial assistance to any such company. That useful power would allow galleries to manage some of their activities efficiently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support many of the powers in clause 3, but the Minister ought to clarify those that relate closely to the debate on clause 2 stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(2)(c) mentions "souvenirs or other goods." The Minister is aware of a heated and lively debate in the museum world during the past few years about the sale of inappropriate material. Mr. Robert Hewison wrote a good book, "The Heritage Industry", which was published in 1987. Some galleries—including the Tate and the national—have excellent shops that sell a good range of books, reproductions, videos, slides and postcards. But the powers in clause 3 would go wider and, in the wrong hands, the clause could be interpreted as providing that any old souvenir—any tatty model of a Gauguin Tahitian person—could be sold. The Minister should make it clear to the Committee, or in a guideline or circular, that he does not mean that any souvenirs or any goods could be sold, but they should be limited to works—book, either visual or literary—that relate to a museum or a gallery and its functions. Only appropriate and relevant material should be for sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister travels round the country visiting independent museums, he will have seen that some of the shops in the less good, independent museums—not the best of them, such as Quarry Bank in Styal—are there merely to sell any sort of heritage-related tat. We do not want that in national museums. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
would be useful if the Minister made it clear that the right to sell souvenirs or other goods would not be an open licence to sell anything—such as plastic models of dinosaurs—in the natural history museum, but only relevant and appropriate material that would further understanding of the collection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the more absurd suggestions that I have heard from the hon. Gentleman, for whom I have great respect. I know that he spent years as shadow Minister for the arts trudging round souvenir shops, museums, and galleries—and I have no doubt that he acquired a great collection of models of Gauguin and Holbein. Nevertheless, the idea of a Minister issuing a decree saying that Gauguin reproductions shall be 4 cm by 18 cm, and be produced by the Victoria and Albert lithographic prints department shows the terrible power of interventionism that would creep through every aspect of Labour policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that if a ministerial directive of the type that he suggests were issued, the first people to make fun of it would be the art critics and correspondents, including Mr. Robin Stringer of the 	<i>Evening Standard,</i> followed by the hon. Gentleman himself—led by Labour Opposition Members. I would not blame them, because it would be ludicrous not to be able to tell directors of galleries and museums that they were responsible for their shops, that their business was to sell
	<br><q><p>"productions of replicas or reproductions of works of art or … souvenirs"</p></q>
but to tell them instead, "We shall lay down a line. This is acceptable and that is not." What a horrible thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shortly before Christmas I visited the Ironbridge museum and found it most interesting. I bought there an extremely good cheese! It makes money for the museum and many local people buy it. I gave it to my wife as a Christmas present and she was thrilled. The idea that the Ironbridge museum should be forbidden to sell cheese because a Labour Minister for arts, media, communications, culture, and und so weiter had decided that cheese was unsuitable is ridiculous. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman was serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was absolutely serious. If the Minister does not understand the debate in the museum world about the heritage industry and the flogging off of anything under the guise of heritage, he has not even done the homework that I had assumed he had done in his year in the job. This is a serious debate about whether the heritage industry should flog anything that relates to the past, or items that further our understanding of, and enthusiasm for, our cultural heritage. If the right hon. Gentleman's chief memory of the Ironbridge museum was a lump of cheese, that says a great deal about him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to the Ironbridge museum, I did not say that my memory of it was the cheese. I called attention to the fact that one of the things
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
that I had seen and purchased during an extremely interesting, albeit wet, afternoon was a cheese. If the museum decides to sell locally produced cheese, then why not? It is the interference with personal liberty that worries me; I see it creeping through the hon. Member's utterances. However, the last thing that I wish to do is to stoke him up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's policy is, "Lovely museums and wonderful delicatesens, so do come". That says a great deal about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was being serious. The Government are giving open-ended powers to museums. They do not have to specify individual souvenirs or goods, they need only mention souvenirs and other goods that further the aims of the gallery or museum, or are appropriate to it. I had not realised how neanderthal the Government were on this point or I would have tabled an amendment. The Tate has the wonderful "L'escargot" by Matisse; let us not see Matisse snails in the Tate shop in ten years' time! That would not be a good way of helping people to understand that great painting. The Minister need not impose limits; he need say only, "Here are powers to sell goods and souvenirs: these should be relevant to furthering the aims of the museums". If the Minister understood that, we would not need to argue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong this extremely stimulating debate. I know of the hon. Gentleman's great respect for Jack Lang. I am aware that the hon. Gentleman wants a Ministry, a budget and some civil servants along the lines of Jack Lang's. The hon. Gentleman's folk hero has designated 70 items of northern French food, including sausages and cheese, part of "le patrimoine". Surely that makes my point. If it is thought in some absurd way that a Minister shall decide what is a respectable souvenir to be sold in a shop in the national gallery, he would get out of touch extremely quickly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is the hon. Gentleman who is out of touch. He has a determinist, interventionist stance; we say that it is up to the director to sell what is suitable and allowed under the clause, which makes clear what may be sold. If he puts tat on the shelves, it will not sell. That is the key to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause and I am pleased that it has been given a stand part debate. The reason for the clause is that the Government want the boards to have the power to add relevant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
objects to their collections, except for the Wallace collection, which is unique. The Government also want to ensure that the new boards—stress this— have powers of disposal that are appropriate to the institutions concerned. The institutions have thus been provided with differing powers of disposal. We believe that management of collections by boards may require certain disposal powers in some cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 provides for the boards of the national gallery, Tate gallery and national portrait gallery to have the power to acquire items for their collections and, in some cases, to dispose of objects. Those powers are in addition to the transfer powers in clause 6. The national galley board is not provided with any powers of disposal other than the transfer of power in clause 6, but certain limited powers of disposal are provided to the boards of the Tate gallery and the national portrait gallery. The Wallace collection board is not provided with any powers to acquire, transfer or dispose of items from its collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that any money accruing from a disposal must be used to acquire relevant objects for the collection. That is an important power for the boards. It will enable them to manage their collections successfully. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is at the heart of the Bill. In our debate on the Floor of the House we explored it to a considerable extent, so I shall not delay the Committee by rehearsing those arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Minister mentioned disposal powers appropriate to the collection, which is exactly our thrust in the two previous debates. We have been urging the Minister that both catering and the sale of souvenirs should be appropriate to the collection. The Minister did not seem to understand the point in that context but I am glad that he understands it in relation to disposal powers. It is a pity that the Minister cannot widen his vision to see that if it is important in disposal it should also be important in relation to a collection and to the other activities of the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 offers another example of the Government inadequately enacting something that nobody could take exception to in principle. The problems stem, as before, from the museums being underfunded. As we noted on the Floor of the House, the purchasing grants of these museums have been frozen for seven years. The context in which these disposal powers are given is one in which the Government have denied acquisition moneys and powers to these museums. They now turn round and say that museums can dispose of items.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows, and should confirm when he responds, that there is no pressure from the museums. None have come to him to ask, "Please may we have disposal powers? We have an awful lot of things that we want to sell. We are being inhibited from doing so and beg the Government to give us these powers so that we can respond." Will the Minister confirm that the director of the Tate gallery, Mr. Nicholas Serota, did not come to the Minister and say, "Please give us these disposal powers."? The galleries are not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
resisting those powers but they did not ask for them. It is interesting to hear that these powers are not being given to the national gallery. The Minister should say a little more about that. Why is the national gallery excluded from the clause? The Minister must admit that he knows that the trustees and the director of the national gallery have vigorously resisted disposal powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that both the Minister and his predecessor have accepted the case made by the national gallery. Why is the national gallery different from the Tate gallery? Opposition Members believe that if that was what it wanted that is exactly what it would have—no disposal powers. The Minister knows well that there is no wave or movement among the directors of national museums to have these disposal powers. The Minister—or his predecessor— has correctly given way to the national gallery but the policy is different for the Tate gallery and the national portrait gallery. The Wallace collection, of course, does not come into this because it is in a different category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes it to the Committee to explain the difference and to come clean about what pressure and arguments came from the national gallery, why his predecessor and he accepted those arguments, and how, in his view, the national gallery differs from the Tate gallery. What assurances can the Minister give the directors that there will not be creeping pressure to dispose of their collections because the Government will continue with a freeze? After the general election, the Government will not have the chance to continue freezing purchasing acquisition grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should explain why these differences and inconsistencies have arisen in the internal workings of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point. The disposal powers contained in the clause have been much discussed by my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham (Sir R. Luce), and by me. We tried to tailor the disposal powers to the perceived needs of the four galleries and their boards, after discussion with them. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Wallace collection is different because it is a closed collection. It can be sold from but not added to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is made clear in clause 4(5)(b) and (c) that in the case of the national portrait gallery disposal has to be of
	<br><q><p>"a relevant object which is a duplicate of another relevant object",</p></q>
or must be
	<br><q><p>"the disposal of a portrait and the Board are satisfied that the identification formerly accepted by them of the person portrayed has been discredited."</p></q>
The hon. Gentleman wanted to know the difference between the Tate gallery and the national gallery, but he already knows because I often see him in those galleries. He is rightly pursuing his shadow function and I am pleased to see him there. The essence is that the national gallery hangs all its collection—now that the Sainsbury wing is open—and does not collect art which is, in general terms, less than 80 to 90 years old. The Tate is different. On average it hangs only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
between 20 and 25 per cent of its collection. To a large extent, it collects contemporary material, which may be devalued in time, but the trustees and the director may take the decision that they have acquired too much or too many of a particular school of painting and that it makes sense to make disposals and to use the resulting funds to acquire more art— in the words of clause 4(7),
	<br><q><p>"relevant objects to be added to their collection."</p></q>
I have had many discussions with the chairman of the trustees and the director of the Tate about the wording of the clause. Obviously I cannot tell the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central the precise nature and detail of those discussions but I can assure him that the wording has been carefully considered and at least one change was made to bring it in line with the discussions that I had with those people. For that reason, I am satisfied with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this is an important part of the Bill, and no one should walk away from that fact, but the limited powers of disposal being given to the Tate gallery board in Clause 4(4)(b)—that
	<br><q><p>"the disposal is of relevant object which, in the Board's opinion, is unsuitable for retention in their collections and can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of students or other members of the public."—</p></q>
are powers which I have no doubt the members of the Tate gallery board, advised by their director, will exercise with great caution and wisdom in the future; and I have no hesitation in commending the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raised two very important matters, and I hope that he is aware of it. The first is simple. He said that the Bill was tailored to the needs of the Tate gallery. He claimed that he had discussed the problem closely with its chairman and the director. Will he confirm that neither came to him and asked for disposal powers? He knows that they did not. The Minister is correct in saying that they accept the wording; but the idea that the Minister is responding to the chairman and director and that they have needs—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Gentleman used the word "needs", and that is not an accurate description of what took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went on to raise the second point, which is very serious. His justification with respect to the Tate was that the gallery needs disposal powers because it hangs only about 20 to 25 per cent of its collection—the implication being that the Tate has surplus works, so that powers are needed to dispose of them. That is worrying, and the Minister should put the record straight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central got so excited about the points that he would raise in opposition to the Government that he did not listen to what I said. He asked me what the difference was between the national gallery and the Tate. I replied that most of the time, the national gallery—and especially the Sainsbury wing—hangs all its collection. The Tate normally hangs only between 20 and 25 per cent of its collection. That is the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an observable difference, but the Minister knows full well that he is talking about this in the context of a clause that gives disposal powers. There is, therefore, a causal link between his observation of how much of the collection is on display and why the Tate needs disposal powers. Clearly, the causal link is that the gallery needs disposal powers to be able to dispose of works that it does not need or is unable to display. That is a very serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will receive a letter from Dennis Stevenson and Nicholas Serota by the end of the week, to the effect that what he said is potentially very dangerous. So far as the trustees, chairman and director of the Tate are concerned, disposal powers should not be granted to dispose of works that they do not hang. Indeed, the excitement of what Nicholas Serota has done with the Tate over the past two years lies in his circulating his collection and rehanging it every year. That deals with the argument that the gallery is able to hang only 25 per cent of paintings. The truth is that it wants greater flexibility to manage and display the collection. It does not want to be pushed into disposing of the part of its collection that is not on display.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real danger that what the Minister has said will lead to that impression of what the Government really want. People may say that that is why they have treated the Tate differently from the national gallery. The Minister will regret what he said, and he should reconsider it. He should make it perfectly clear that he does not want the Tate to dispose of works that are not on display.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One last contribution from me. The hon. Gentleman is showing his well-known characteristic: he can never see a top without going over it. I have already made it clear that the two galleries are different. I also said—and I repeat—that the Tate gallery is engaged in acquiring modern, contemporary works of art. Unlike those in the national gallery, some of these works may not stand the test of time. It is not right, therefore, as I have said time and again, for the Tate gallery to have the same powers of disposal as the national gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

space, the sale of souvenirs and so on—must be dealt with in the accounts, so that the public can see how much money has been raised through using museums and galleries as venues, rather than through their collections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the practice of accounting for receipts from lettings, which the hon. Gentleman finds so disturbing, differs from one institution to another. It depends partly on whether the institution has established a trading company to handle its commercial activities. If it has done so, as in the case of the science museum, receipts for such activities as lettings would appear in separate accounts of the trading company, not in the museum's grant-in-aid accounts. However, I shall take up the point raised by the hon. Gentleman and write to him when I have more information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and I look forward to receiving his letter. A very serious issue is at stake here. In conducting my research on the scale and nature of lettings as venues, I encountered a variety of responses from museums. Some, such as the natural history museum, were very forthcoming and helpful in providing information about their lettings and about how much income was gained. Others, such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, were different. I was unable to speak to the director, Mrs Esteve-Coll, but members of her staff claimed that the information was private and that they could not release it. Yet these are public museums, operating for the public on behalf of the public, and they are accountable to the Minister. I hope that he will make it clear that all museums should account to him, to Parliament and the public for what they are doing. The coyness displayed by Victoria and Albert museum staff yesterday on the telephone—they were reluctant to say how much they charged, to which groups they letted property and what the income generated was—is not good practice. They have a responsibility to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>with the substitution for the reference to Parliament in subsection (2) of a reference to the Northern Ireland Assembly.'.".</li></ol></ol></p>
	<p>I wish to speak at some length, because this is a detailed amendment. I said on Second Reading that I would table an amendment to clause 10 in Committee. The amendment would delete previous section 16A, which provided for designated institutions to give indemnities when borrowing for public exhibition or study; and would make minor consequential amendments to old section 16B, which would become 16A.</p>
	<p>I have tabled this amendment following representations made to me by national museum and gallery directors who wished the present arrangements, whereby indemnities are issued by my Office, to continue.</p>
	<p>The amendment does not affect two other changes provided for in clause 10, namely, the removal of the need for approval by Ministers of lenders of objects covered by the Government indemnity scheme, and a further provision of a reporting regime to Parliament for the number of indemnities issued and outstanding to be reported on a regular six-monthly basis.</p>
	<p>I should like to explain to the Committee this apparent reversal of policy. Hon. Members will be aware that the National Heritage Act 1980 was passed, as I anticipate this Bill will be, with all-party support. It put Government indemnities for loans of works of art and other museum objects to our national institutions on a statutory footing. It also extended the scheme dramatically to non-national museums and galleries, libraries, the National Trust, and to other bodies approved specifically by Ministers.</p>
	<p>The Act was warmly welcomed at the time, and has proved of inestimable value. The non-nationals saved, in 1990–91 alone, some £8 million in insurance premiums. And, which is more to the point, these loans would never have taken place if these institutions had had to pay such high premiums.</p>
	<p>The statutory power in the 1980 Act for the issue of all indemnities lies with Ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the territorial Secretaries of State, with other individual Ministers who sponsor their own institutions, such as the Ministry of Defence and Department of the Environment, and with the Lord President for museums and galleries funded by the Office of Arts and Libraries.</p>
	<p>Before 1980, the national bodies now sponsored by the OAL had issued indemnities themselves, under cover of a Treasury memorandum. They said that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
they wished to continue to do so and arrangements for OAL-sponsored bodies were entered into between 1987 and 1990. They were thought to be in order under the 1980 Act, but, on further legal advice, they were ended in November 1990. At that time the Office of Arts and Libraries took over the issue of indemnities for its national bodies and continued to issue non-national indemnities; applications were processed and submitted by the Museums and Galleries Commission. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were not in the same position, having issued indemnities departmentally since 1980.</p>
	<p>It was against that background, and at their request that my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Shoreham, undertook to find an early opportunity to take statutory provision to enable designated national institutions to issue their own indemnities. I repeat that that was done at the request of the bodies to the right hon. Member for Shoreham.</p>
	<p>I am pleased to tell the Committee that, since 1990 and despite their initial misgivings, directors and their registrars have welcomed the consistent advice, and its application to individual loans, which has been provided by my office. They have been impressed with the efficient service provided. In January last, for example, 93 per cent of the 81 indemnities requested were issued within 24 hours, after careful scrutiny by my officials. I am sure that the Committee would like to thank and congratulate the officials of the Office of Arts and Libraries for issuing indemnities so speedily and efficiently.</p>
	<p>The original clause 10 needed not only to allow for institutions to issue indemnities, but to provide financially for the payment of claims. It is a reality of our system of parliamentary supply that we would, under the proposed new provision, look first to the individual institutions to make good any claims out of existing resources and, if unable to do so, they would apply to their sponsoring Departments, which in turn would, if unable also to meet the claim, apply to Parliament for the moneys. The 1980 Act refers to the second of those steps since the contract is between a Minister, on behalf of the Government, and a lender. By making a designated institution the contracting party, the first call would rest clearly with that institution.</p>
	<p>I appreciate that that may raise doubts in the minds of some lenders and we do not want that to happen because we want to encourage lending. Such doubts have existed in the past when foreign Governments in particular insisted on an indemnity from the Government and not from the institution borrowing their property. The directors have also acknowledged that in their representations to me. Hence, I agreed to amend the clause to preserve the status quo established by the 1980 Act concerning the issue of indemnities. That change is incorporated in the amendment before us.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the amendment. We are relieved that it was tabled by the Government and that it has the support of the trustees and directors of the museums. However, we cannot allow our welcome of the amendment or the Minister's cloud
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
of words to distract attention from the fact that he made a major and unnecessary blunder which caused consternation and which says a lot about the way in which he has fulfilled his responsibilities. He is a clever fellow with a first class academic mind, but too often during the past year he has shown that he prefers trusting his own judgment to listening to expert opinion around him. This is such a case. He went off on a course of action without taking advice or considering what he was doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to say that this is a very important matter. If the indemnity system is wrong and does not inspire confidence, benefactors and others who wish to lend pictures for exhibition will be deterred from, and will resist, doing so. The long tradition in this country of other collections and benefactors making loans, either permanently or temporarily, will thus be inhibited. The Minister implicitly accepted that the Bill got that wholly wrong; our contention is that it was unnecessarily wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not listen to or take advice. When the draft Bill was circulated to the Museums and Galleries Commission in September 1991, the clause which the Minister has now removed and replaced was not in the Bill. Will he confirm that? People in the MGC were unable to look at it. Had they done so, they could have told the Minister then that it was completely wrong and would cause consternation in the museum world. The right hon. Gentleman did not consult because he did not let people see the clause until the Bill had been published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should make it clear where the clause came from. He tried to give the impression that the original wording was in response to and at the direction of trustees and directors. He must know that that is not so. He has gone on to paint a gloss over his blunder, and in a letter to directors he stated:
	<br><q><p>"I very much regret that, between us all, we did not recognise the potential problems contained in the financial provision in Clause 10."</p></q>
This is an opportunity for the Government to be a little more frank and apologetic to the museum world. To say "between us all" suggests a sharing of the responsibility for a completely wrong clause. The Minister knows that he and he alone has responsibility for the wording. The responsibility for getting it wrong was not shared with trustees or directors of museums and he should make that clear. He should have more humility and say, "I got it wrong." We welcome his courage in changing the Bill and the clause is now more constructive, but he has been less than frank and apologetic to the Committee and to the museums and benefactors which have had a hard few days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the Minister's praise for OAL staff and the way in which they have handled the indemnity system. The Minister should also note his interesting and helpful reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Warley, East (Mr. Faulds) on 20 February 1992, when he itemised at column 241 the amount of indemnities that had been paid out and stated that they amounted to £149,000 over the past 10 years. Payments of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
£78,000 in 1987, £10,000 in 1989 and £61,000 in 1990 were made and in 1985, 1986 and 1988 no indemnities were paid out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting and slightly revealing that the Minister said that in the years 1980–85 central records were not kept and have been maintained only since 1985. We do not know what the indemnities were for those years, but the scale of indemnities has been illustrated. If hon. Members feel that the small amount is significant, they draw the wrong conclusion. The indemnities are a tribute to OAL staff and the manner in which they have implemented them; they are also important as a safety net far beyond the scale of indemnity payments that have been made. The Minister ought to speak again and take more responsibility himself instead of allotting it to others. He made a mistake. He has got it right now and we welcome that, but his cavalier attitude has caused much bother to many people in the past few weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the original clause was a matter for parliamentary counsel. I have explained the background to the way in which the clause was drawn up. The draft of the Bill was sent to directors of museums and galleries in late October for their consideration, and it included clause 10.1 heard from directors the difficulties that they foresaw with clause 10 only on the Friday before Second Reading. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman doubts my word. He made his point on Second Reading, and I then told him the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote the letter to directors of museums and galleries, but not one has written to complain about the wording. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central was not involved; he was a shadow Minister for the arts. I think that the hon. Gentleman has listened to a little too much gossip in Bond street galleries, which does him no credit. The clause was drafted late in October and sent round late in November. The draft was with the directors from late November onwards. The matter is now behind us. We have a revised, satisfactory clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining provisions in clause 10 are germane to the amendment. Clause 10(1) would remove the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
need for Ministers, with the consent of the Treasury, to approve lenders of objects to either national or non-national bodies. This appears to have been an unintended consequence of the 1980 Act. While we wish to continue to approve certain borrowing institutions, in order to satisfy ourselves of their financial and management soundness, there is clearly no need to do so with individual lenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 16A, which previously was section 16B, would establish a reporting regime on indemnities issued. This is a technical amendment which addresses a Government accounting requirement that, in the absence of a specific provision, indemnity liability should be reported to Parliament on every occasion. Clearly this would be onerous on Departments and on Parliament and it would not be a cost-effective use of scarce official resources.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a moment during the Minister's reading of the brief when I thought that he would accept amendment No. 13. If he will, our debate will be brief too, but I suspect that he will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee wishes also to debate the Scottish aspects of the Bill, so I shall not be long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for tabling an amendment to increase the term for trustees from five to seven years is that all the directors of museums to whom we spoke want that. When it suits him, the Minister says that he has listened to, and responded to, what directors and trustees have told him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will confirm that the directors of the Tate and national galleries would prefer seven years. He should make it clear whether any body or person, has said to him, "We want five years, not seven." If he cannot do that, will he explain why he, as a matter of personal whim, prefers five years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is good reason for a seven-year term. The duties and responsibilities of directors of museums are serious. The expertise and knowledge of collections that they must master are onerous and, as collections grow, and museums and galleries expand—for example, the new Sainsbury wing with the Clore collection—and as issues such as income generation and sponsorship grow more pressing and complex and the demands of the capital side grow more difficult because of Government under-funding, so directors' responsibilities increase. We are well served in this country, as I hope the Minister will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directors of our national galleries and museums are expert men and women with the scholarship and knowledge that these collections demand. But to say that they should hold the post for five years only is to demean the contribution that they can make. The Government have recently given the trustees a whole new area of responsibility, namely the management of their land and buildings. The Minister is asking a great deal of part-time, unpaid trustees by giving them that responsibility, which is in addition to all the artistic, cultural and scholarly matters with which they deal. We are in their debt, but we will not get the best from them if we impose a five-year term—their responsibilities are already complex and demanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many trustees, and the chairs of boards of trustees, have told me—and, I suspect, the Minister—that it takes at least a couple of years to get on top of the job, to feel confident and to make the full contribution that their level of scholarship should allow them to make. To leave them with only another three years in which to make their contribution minimises their efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where did the idea of a five-year term come from? Is it the Minister's idea, rather than a response to the views of the boards? I hope that he will consider the common sense of our remarks. We have not been making party-political points. We have simply responded, unlike the Government, to what the chairs and the directors of galleries have said. We believe that their comments make good sense. The trustees should be appointed for seven years so that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
they can contribute to the galleries in the way that they want to, and in a way that those galleries deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair debating point. Committees typically spend their time debating whether to change three for five, five for seven, two for one, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many precedents for a five-year term in the world of museums and galleries. The Victoria and Albert museum, the science museum, and the national museums and galleries on Merseyside have five-year terms for their trustees. The national portrait gallery took the view that five years was satisfactory. After consideration, I concluded that a five-year period was appropriate for a reason that the hon. Gentleman did not mention, namely that the clause will allow for reappointment for further periods of up to five years. The hon. Gentleman will know from his study of the tenure of trustees of galleries—I join him in paying tribute to their standard of knowledge, their qualifications, and the time that they spend on their unpaid work—that it is standard practice for most trustees to be appointed for a second term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normal practice under the clause will be for trustees to serve for 10 years. They would be appointed initially for five years. If the Minister or the Prime Minister were told that a trustee had served satisfactorily, he would be reappointed for a second term. If the first term were for seven years, trustees would be less likely to be reappointed. People might decide that however wise and expert a trustee, 14 years of service was too long. I therefore think that we have got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is obviously a good debating point, but five years, with the power of reappointment and the expectation of reappointment, is about right. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am delighted to see that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) has just joined us. I did not catch his comment, but he should consider that the leader of the Labour party is reappointed each year, as is the shadow Cabinet. The shadow Minister for the Arts has held his post for a very long time—five years, or is it seven? I suspect that he is about to be reappointed for another five-year term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the five-year term with the possibility of reappointment is about right, although I recognise that views may vary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit laboured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1988 report of the Museums and Galleries Commission noted that terms of appointment were generally for five or seven years, but it did not express a preference.

However, in the two hours it took to circle round Birmingham I was able to read and reread the Bill and all of the bits that go with it, so my time was put to some use. Nevertheless I should have liked to have been here at the start rather than so near the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 has the effect of putting the national gallery of Scotland on the same footing as its sister galleries in London. I am assuming that Committee members will have read the debate on Second Reading during which I set out the arguments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
that lie behind the amendment. I do not propose to go over them again from the start because matters have moved on since. Essentially, and this is the important point, if the Bill is not amended in the way that I propose, the national gallery of Scotland will be at a serious disadvantage vis-á-vis its sister gallery in Trafalgar square.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 allows disposals but lays down strict criteria governing those disposals. In other words, it would stop the trustees of the gallery in Trafalgar square from getting rid of works of art that it holds, perhaps to a private collector, because they must be kept in the public domain. Unfortunately, the Scottish galleries are governed by a different regime. In 1985 they were given powers that they did not request and did not want. It is unusual for any Government to give such powers, but give them they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 4C of the National Galleries of Scotland Act 1906 the Scottish gallery has the power to dispose of its works of art. Clearly a problem exists because of financial limits brought about by the economic climate or as a deliberate act of Government policy. For instance, trustees might feel under pressure to get rid of works they hold which they would otherwise not want to dispose of. The problem thus created is that people who might want to gift works of art to the national gallery of Scotland will not want their works of art to end up in private collections. They may decide to make a bequest not to the national gallery of Scotland but to its sister galleries in England. That is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last September these matters were brought to the attention of the Scottish Office, which is the main sponsoring Department of the national gallery of Scotland. There followed an exchange of correspondence, but from what I have seen of it not a great deal happened until Second Reading, when it is fair to say that the Scottish Office was galvanised into action. There has been much correspondence since between the Scottish Office and the national gallery of Scotland. There has also been correspondence between the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood that the Government accepted that there was merit in amending this Bill or some other Bill to put the Scottish gallery on the same footing as the gallery in Trafalgar square. However, the Government have now advanced a completely different reason for opposing the amendment—its possible hybridity. We are not in a court and so I cannot properly advance a legal argument on this matter. But I shall have to cover some ground because the Minister is briefed to advance reasons why my amendment should be repelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Government have satisfied themselves that the Bill is hybrid. I say in passing, with no disrespect to lawyers who advise the Scottish office—as a lawyer myself it would be wrong of me to criticise other lawyers for what they do—that all lawyers will give their clients the advice they want to best support their cause. In giving legal advice one sets out the legal position but before doing so the question is asked, "What is it that you want?". There are always two sides to a legal argument and I suspect
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
that Ministers in the Scottish Office have said that they were in a bit of a jam because they did not have an amendment to the Bill, and asked for advice. What I can see from the letter from the Minister to me is that those advising Scottish Office Ministers have done their best to advance reasons to support the contention that the amendment will render the Bill hybrid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Government's anxiety to get the Bill on the statute book. One of the arguments advanced is that if the Bill does become hybrid certain procedures will have to be followed, such as advertising in the 	<i>London Gazette</i> and so on, which might delay it. Because Parliament is likely to be dissolved within two or three weeks—I see the Minister looking at his watch even now; pehaps he knows something that we do not. Perhaps my introductory leaflet should be sent to the printers today instead of tomorrow—I understand the problem, although I find it difficult to see how the Bill will get through both Houses before dissolution. Still, I think that this is so important that it cannot wait for another Bill to crop up. The Bill has been on the stocks for months and some of the amendments being sought have been around for years. Clearly, it is not satisfactory if the Scottish gallery is at a disadvantage vis-á-vis the gallery in Trafalgar square.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister will not want to wander too far from his brief, I urge him to think about the consequences of leaving the Scottish gallery at such a disadvantage. My understanding of a hybrid Bill is, to quote "Erskine May":
	<br><q><p>"A public bill which affects a particular private interest in a manner different from the private interests of other persons or bodies of the same category or class."</p></q>
The Bill already affects other private bodies—for example, the galleries in London. I do not see how including a provision relating to the national gallery of Scotland would render the Bill hybrid. I accept that it will be the only Scottish body thus affected, but I am not sure that that comes within Erskine May's definition. "Erskine May" also says:
	<br><q><p>"A Bill has not been regarded as hybrid if all the persons or bodies affected by it, and no others, belong to a category or class germane to the subject-matter of the bill."</p></q>
Presumably that would meet the position in this Bill because it affects museums and art galleries by reference to its long title. Erskine May continues:
	<br><q><p>"It is not the practice to treat as hybrid, bills dealing with matters of public policy whereby private rights over large areas or of a whole class are affected."</p></q>
Both arguments are covered there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept that parliamentary counsel is entitled to take a different view. My suggestion is that if the Government have no objection in principle to the amendment, which I understand is their position, it would be far better to accept it and see what parliamentary counsel has to say about it. If counsel then raises formidable objections to stop it in its tracks, perhaps something could be done on Report. If the Government insist on relying upon an arguable legal point, one cannot but suspect that the inertia of the Scottish Office last autumn was due simply to the fact that the Scottish Office does not want to change the position.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
Some of us remember the draft proposals from the Scottish Office Education Department, which suggested that one way for galleries to make some money would be to get rid of some assets. I know that the Under-Secretary is a cultured man who would not be a party to such asset-stripping, but there are others in the Scottish Office—both the Under-Secretary and I know whom I have in mind—who might not baulk at such action. It would certainly be most unfortunate if the national gallery of Scotland were left isolated. Nobody wants that. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] We should listen to what the Under-Secretary has to say. He has just been cautioned by the Minister to be careful, but I have never heard him being anything but cautious. I should like to hear what he has to say and then respond to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that there is a serious problem, which needs urgently to be sorted out. To refer to a possible private Member's Bill or a future Bill is not good enough. If there were a common will to resolve the legal arguments, I am sure that we could succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to many of the hon. Gentleman's points. I am also sympathetic to the principle of the board of trustees of the national galleries of Scotland that it should be able to dispose of items in those collections only to other national institutions. Indeed, as I have indicated to the hon. Gentleman in correspondence, I was disposed to introduce an amendment to curtail the existing disposal powers of the national galleries to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I also explained in my letter, if amendments such as these were accepted, the Bill would be rendered 	<i>prima facie</i> hybrid. As hon. Members know, that would mean that the Bill would have to go through the additional stages that the Standing Orders of the House require for private business. The risk—in the present circumstances, it is a real risk— is that these extra steps would mean that there would not be time for the Bill to complete all its parliamentary stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendments are important to the national galleries, which would be disappointed if their disposal powers were not curtailed as proposed. However, the absence of these amendments would not mean that the national galleries of Scotland would rush to sell items in their collections, and I hope that hon. Members will agree that we should not jeopardise other important provisions, relating to a wide range of national institutions, with which the Bill is principally concerned. It may be helpful to hon. Members if I explained briefly why the question of hybridity arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say whether this is Scottish Office preliminary advice or something more than that? Have we reached the stage where the House authorities have said that if the amendment were carried, the Bill would be hybrid and lead to certain problems, or is this only preliminary advice? It seems to me as if the Under-Secretary is throwing in the towel rather early.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman has asked what I want, and the answer is that I want two things. First, I want this problem sorted out and, secondly, I want the Bill to be passed. Those two aims are not inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not, of course, for the Committee to decide whether the Bill is hybrid. That is for the examiners to decide. A question about hybridity is all that is needed to refer a Bill to the examiners, and a reference to them would hold up the Bill and jeopardise its passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board of trustees of the national galleries of Scotland was constituted a body corporate under the National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985. That had the effect of giving the board a legal personality. The board is therefore a person whose interests may be adversely affected by legislation. If such legislation were applied specifically to that person, the Bill could become subject to the hybridity procedures, which I have already mentioned. I am advised that curtailment of the disposal powers of the national galleries of Scotland, as proposed in the amendments, would affect their interests in such a way as to have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should also deal briefly with two points that were raised on Second Reading. First, I can clarify the respective positions of the national galleries of Scotland and the national gallery, Trafalgar square in relation to powers of disposal. The amendments would give the national galleries of Scotland the same disposal powers as those proposed for the national gallery, Trafalgar square, in clause 4(3) and clause 6. The significant difference is that the amendments would curtail the powers that the national galleries of Scotland already have; whereas clause 4(3) would confer new powers on the newly established board of the national gallery, Trafalgar square. Since existing rights are not being affected, clause 4(3) does not make the Bill 	<i>prima facie</i> hybrid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, my right hon. Friend explained on Second Reading that it was open to potential donors to make a gift or bequest to the national galleries of Scotland under present legislation without any fear that the item would subsequently be disposed of. All that is required is to attach an appropriate condition to the gift, and I understand that that is a relatively straightforward matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my hon. Friend for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), I am not a lawyer, so I am always somewhat confused by legal matters. I am trying to follow the Under-Secretary's argument. He said that the national gallery of Scotland has a legal personality, which causes hybridity. Will he assure the Committee that the national gallery, Trafalgar square, and the Tate gallery do not have legal personalities in the same way, and that the inconsistency does not apply to them? Will he also confirm that the Bill does not give new powers to the national gallery in Trafalgar square, but confirms existing powers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Under-Secretary's concluding remarks, he said that new powers were being conferred on the national gallery, Trafalgar Square. As I understand
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
it, they are not. the Minister needs to reconsider his brief. I do not recognise the distinction in legal personality between the different galleries in the same way as the Minister, nor do I recognise the new powers to which he referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point is that existing rights of the national gallery in Trafalgar square are not being affected or diminished in any way; but the amendments would reduce existing rights of the national galleries of Scotland. That is why the question of hybridity arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pay tribute to the many private benefactors such as Sir Denis Mahon whose generosity has enhanced our public collections. I hope that they will continue to do so, and that they will recognise that, with appropriate conditions, they can safely make gifts to the national galleries of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure hon. Members and potential benefactors alike that we take this matter extremely seriously and, having accepted the principle of curtailed disposal powers, we will consider further how that might be achieved in some future Bill, including a possible private Member's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very grateful for the patriotism of possible donors such as Sir Denis Mahon, whose patriotism, furthermore, is matched by his generosity. We owe it to them to ensure that these matters are dealt with in the best possible way. I repeat that I am in sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point. It should and will be taken forward in future, but not at the cost of scuppering this Bill. I hope that what I have said will persuade the hon. Gentleman not to jeopardise the Bill and that he will withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all agreed that we want the Bill placed on the statute book as soon as possible. The Under-Secretary has said that we should not pursue the valid interests of the national galleries of Scotland because that would take too long. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central, who said that the Bill will encounter great difficulty getting through in this Parliament anyway, irrespective of whether we pursue the question of hybridity. Even so, there is no cause to pass bad, unjust and unfair legislation simply in the interest of haste. The Bill, when passed, will be on the statute book for a considerable time; to pass it, when we know that it is deficient, is a poor way for a Committee to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has already said that he and his Department have accepted the validity of our case—it has been put in writing in letters of February and earlier—for the past few months. The Under-Secretary knows that we have made a good point, and it would make far better law if the point were incorporated in the Bill. Yet in the interest, solely of speed, he is prepared to advocate deficient and unjust legislation. That is a very bad principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more importantly, the Under-Secretary is urging us to turn a blind eye to the unfairness and inefficiency of the Bill because of the need for speed. It is difficult for the Committee to accept that when the Bill has been around for more than three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
The right hon. Member for Shoreham first drafted a version of the Bill several years ago. He tried to introduce it in the House, as did the Chief Secretary of the Treasury when he was Minister for the Arts, and it is to the credit of the present Minister that he has found the time to do so. But having had three years in which to consider the matter, it ill becomes the Government to say that we should accept a provision that we all know to be unfair, unjust and inadequate simply because during those three years the Government did not spot the problem. They have had correspondence with people such as Sir Hugh Leggatt and have been aware of the problem for five or six months, but have done nothing about it. Indeed, in correspondence to the Scottish Office and the Office of Arts and Libraries in the past few months they have given assurances that all would be sorted out. Only on 5 February, when the Bill was finally published, could people see that the matter had not been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not good enough for the Government to say, when the matter had been brought to their attention in September, October, November and December, that all would be well and then to turn round and say in February, "We've just discovered that the Bill is hybrid." That is inefficient and an inadequate response. The Government have had plenty of time to consider the matter, if not for the past three years, at least for the past five months when it has been brought to their attention and they have conceded the point. The Government should not be allowed to get away with this and the Office of Arts and Libraries must also be drawn in, because this is its Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Minister explained that no specific request had come to him although he knew that his Department had known about it since 1 October. It is confusing that it went to his Department without going to him, especially when he said a few sentences later that
	<br><q><p>"I am aware that an approach was made to the Scottish Office."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 February 1992; Vol. 203, c.1010.]</p></q>
The hybridity was not established until 5 February, so that is not a valid reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that civil servants in his Department have been corresponding on the matter since last autumn and it is disingenuous of him to say that he was unaware of that when his Department had been aware of it since last September or October. I am not sure that he was entirely candid with the House on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Office of Arts and Libraries have known about this since September, as have the Scottish Office, and, I suspect, both Ministers—their Departments have suggested that this is a good and just amendment. It is not good enough to claim hybridity at the last minute and, because we all want the Bill to be enacted, to try to shove it through in this way. The Government have come out of this extremely badly, and even at this late stage should be urged to reconsider the matter before Report. We all know that the amendment should be accepted and that not to accept it would damage the national

gallery of Scotland. I repeat: it ill becomes the House to pass legislation that we know is deficient and unjust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman started with a good point, which he spoiled by going over the top. I accept that it is highly desirable that the matter should be sorted out, but it is not in the interests of anyone to scupper the Bill. The matter was fully considered and a policy decision was made to recognise the national gallery of Scotland's representations and views and to take action on them. Only when the drafting was considered did the question of hybridity arise. We had to take the best advice of lawyers, and we have been considering possible solutions since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the technical question, the difference in law between the national gallery of Scotland and the national gallery has nothing to do with their respective locations. It has to do with the national gallery of Scotland being already a private body whereas the national gallery is being set up as a new creature of statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of hybridity may have come to the attention of hon. Members only in February, but my Department has been considering it since the terms of a possible amendment were considered in December. I hope that this matter will go forward as soon as practicable but I do not feel that I would be justified in playing an active role in scuppering the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a good argument. I do not suggest that the difference between the national gallery of Scotland and its equivalent in England rests entirely upon one being in Edinburgh and the other in London "Erskine May" refers to a private interest. The Minister, in his letter, when distinguishing between the gallery in Edinburgh and the gallery in London, said that the latter was getting new powers. I find no reference to new powers in "Erskine May", whose definition is that a public Bill has to affect a particular private interest in a manner different from other private interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the hybridity issue was raised when the Trustee Savings Bank was privatised, but then the Government were happy to rely on the arguments that I am making to stop public petitions against the privatisation. I do not care about irritating the Minister. I appreciate that what happens to the national gallery of Scotland may be a matter of supreme indifference to him—his response on Second Reading when I raised the matter showed as much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's attitude has caused resentment north of the border. The junior Minister says that the Scottish Office had been considering the matter for some time, but my information is that some weeks went by when nothing happened. A policy decision may have been taken to the effect that the national gallery had a good point of principle, but nothing much has happened since. If the Bill had been introduced a little earlier the hybridity problem could have been anticipated and steps put in hand
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
to secure its passage as a hybrid Bill. If the Government had wanted to do something about it, they could have, but they did not—either through disinterest or indolence. It is extremely irritating for those who are anxious about the national gallery of Scotland to find that it is being put at a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary rightly paid tribute to Sir Denis Mahon for his generosity and his contributions to the art world. I should like to pay tribute to his tenacity and his willingness to instruct solicitors to pursue the Scottish Office. Both of us know that Sir Denis and those who act for him have tried hard to convince the Scottish Office that action ought to have been taken. It is sad that Ministers are now falling back on a weak position—they would love to do something, but they do not wish to lose the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of Government business is in the Government's hands. I am not so sure that the Bill will get through its stages here and in the other place. Major legislation is lying in the doldrums with the Government unable to do anything about it, although they tell us that some of it is crucial. It would certainly be curious if the Bill went through both Houses and received Royal Assent before 16 March, or whenever dissolution takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's arguments about hybridity are a statable case but this is not the place to state them; they should be stated before the House authorities. The hon. Gentleman puts only one legal argument—the one that states his case. No one can fault him for doing that—he is reading the Scottish Office brief, and discharging the SO's obligation to defend its position, no matter how weak. But the public will not understand why the Government rely upon a legal point that is, at best, debatable, knowing that it may be many years before more legislation relating to museums and art galleries is introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is deplorable that nothing has happened for so long. It was not until 	<i>The Scotsman</i> reported the subject the day after Second Reading—that, suddenly, the Minister's officials seemed to spring into action. That is a sorry reflection on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made his position known. There was no chance of the Government backing down once the matter had been raised. The Government want to push the Bill through and I can understand that. However, I am sorry that the national gallery of Scotland is being left in such an isolated position. I have no intention of withdrawing the amendment, because I do not want anyone to believe that Opposition Members accepted the Government's arguments for one moment. Given the opportunity to do so, furthermore, we shall return to the issue on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should never be allowed to forget that they have dealt with the national gallery of Scotland in a very unfortunate way. This is essentially an arts and libraries—type Bill, and no one thought that other problems might have needed to be dealt with. It is unfortunate that a more active interest was not taken at an earlier stage by the relevant Ministers. Had it been, we would not be in this difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>'Power of the Board to form companies.</p>
	<p>2A.—(1) With the consent of the Lord President of the Council and subject to any conditions he may impose, the Board may form, or take part in forming, one or more bodies corporate which, or each of which, has as its main object or objects one or more of those mentioned in subsection (2) below.
	<ol>
	<li>The objects referred to in subsection (1) above are—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the production and publication of books, films or other informative material relating to the Museum's collection or theme;</li>
	<li>the production of replicas or reproductions of objects relating to the Museum's collection or theme, or of souvenirs;</li>
	<li>the sale (whether or not at an hour when the collection is open to the public for viewing) of informative material relating to the Museum's collection or theme, or of souvenirs or other goods;</li>
	<li>the provision (whether or not at such an hour) of catering or car parking or other services or facilities for the public at any premises occupied or managed by the Board; and</li>
	<li>any other object or objects incidental to the Board's functions.</li></ol>
	<li>The Board may hold interests in any such body, exercise rights conferred by the holding of interests in it, and provide financial or other assistance to or in respect of it (including assistance by way of guarantee of its obligations).</li>
	<li>This section is without prejudice to any power of the Board to undertake by virtue of section 2 above anything mentioned in subsection (2) above.'</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendment No. 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government wish to provide the board of trustees of the Imperial war museum with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
company-forming powers analogous to those given to the boards of trustees of the national gallery, the national portrait gallery, the Tate gallery and the Wallace collection under clause 3. These powers would enable the board to carry out relevant activities as efficiently as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also noted that the Imperial war museum was limited by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, under which it did not have the power to give leases on land for third parties and could not allow their premises to be used by other persons. If the Imperial war museum were given such powers, they would enable it to generate revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Keith Hampson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support on a subject that he follows closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also wish to amend the National Heritage Act 1983 in order to provide the board of trustees of the armouries with the power to allow their premises to be used by other persons—again, to generate revenue. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear strong support from my hon. Friends—unlike the blinkered attitude of Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 therefore allows trustees of the Imperial war museum to dispose of land subject to Government consent by means additional to those of sale and for the application of moneys received by further means. It provides an additional power to the board of trustees of the Imperial war museum to allow premises occupied or managed by them to be used by other persons for payment or otherwise for purposes not connected with the board's functions, provided that they are satisfied that such usage would not unduly interfere with their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable trustees, therefore, with Government consent, to form or take part in forming companies. The activities of these companies would be to produce and sell books, films, informative material, replicas or reproductions of objects relating to the board's collection or theme, and souvenirs or other goods; and also to provide catering or other services to the public. The board would also be able to give financial assistance to any such companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 12 provides an additional power to the boards of the trustees of the armouries to allow premises occupied or managed by them to be used by other persons for payment or otherwise for purposes not connected with the boards' functions, provided that they are satisfied that such usage would not unduly interfere with their functions. Those useful powers will enable the Imperial war museum to manage certain of its activities efficiently and they will enable the armouries to generate revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
