<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p><b>[Continuation from column 214]</b></p>
<p>8.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It falls to me to be the after-dinner speaker for the second night running. During the break, I read a reference to the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities in the diary column of the <i>Evening Standard.</i> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman saw it, but he was described as a member of the "no combing back group".<br><br>
As for the poll tax, its parting will not be such sweet sorrow. Amendment No. 34 highlights the problems that will be created by a banding system. It proposes that the council tax should be in proportion to the rateable values of properties, thereby making it more fairer and accurate than a banding system.<br><br>
There is considerable confusion about the effect that the banding system will have in London. The results of a survey carried out by the London Research Centre showed that 35 per cent. of properties in London will fall into the top bands covering properties whose value is in excess of £88,000. The Government calculate, however, that 55 per cent. of London properties are expected to be worth in excess of £88,000. That is a great difference. The Minister should be truthful; it seems that the Department of the Environment figures are wrong.<br><br>
Which calculations are right? What will be the effect of those figures on London, especially if the Government are wrong? I wish to highlight the problems caused by introducing the banding system in haste without knowing its exact implications for London. If the survey is right, not so many taxpayers will come into the high bands as was first feared. That would have created a problem as between those in the middle band and the top band. The problem will not be so severe if the survey is right, but higher tax rates will be set and, overall, those in the lower and middle bands will receive higher bills as local authorities in London make up the money lost to them as a result of that calculation.<br><br>
Over the past few years, house prices in London have varied considerably. Let us compare house prices in 1987 with those in 1991. More properties would have been placed in the higher bands if the valuation had taken place in 1987. The bands are unstable, unreliable and out of line with actual house prices in London. If those properties were sold subsequently, there would have had to be new valuations, which would have created a severe problem when trying to assess the depressed 1991 values.<br><br>
In 1990 the Halifax building society compared the regional bands within greater London for 1987 with those for 1990.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is anticipating an amendment that will be debated later, provided that he chooses to sit down before 10 o'clock.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall stop while I am winning; I shall make that point later. Enough has been said to show that there are considerable problems with such a banding structure, especially within London.<br><br>
Before dinner, I mentioned the problem of unfairness at band borders. Bands are not based on the real value of property that people recognise. That confusion will be even worse in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to make a short speech, as I believe that the Committee would like to consider the next group of amendments dealing with regional banding. I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire), for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) and for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) for their contributions. To do so is frustrating, because dealing with the Opposition seems like wrestling with a bar of wet soap. One can never pin the Opposition down to anything; they say one thing one day and another thing the next. Indeed, they often say two different things on the same day. Yesterday, when dealing with annual revaluations, the Opposition said different things within two minutes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said at the end of his speech that he found the banding system "objectionable in principle." He said that despite the fact that a banding system was mentioned in the "Fair Rates" document and despite the fact that in the local government—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. Let me finish the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot refuse to give way in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never refuse to give way, but let me finish the point. The hon. Gentleman said what he did despite the fact that, during the Committee proceedings on the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991, the Labour party tabled amendments that proposed a banding system. It was also despite the fact that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said in the <i>Municipal Journal</i> on 25 October:
<br><blockquote><p>"the party had no objection in principle to valuation bands, so long as the bands were right."</p></blockquote>
Whereas the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside said that there is no objection in principle, the hon. Member for Dagenham said that it is objectionable in principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can put the Minister out of his misery. On that issue he can cease to wrestle with the bar of soap, as he put it. Incidentally, that explains why he and his colleagues are so ineffective. Does he not understand what we thought we made perfectly clear in the "Fair Rates" proposals? We conceded in "Fair Rates" that there might be merit in a system of actual revaluation, in which every property is valued individually, specifically and properly, combined with an annual uprating of the valuation to ensure that the tax base remains buoyant. However, we are not committed to using such a system. There is a great difference between an automatic uprating to take account of inflation, which might be achieved by banding, and an actual property revaluation that involves individual valuation. That is the purpose of the amendment and of all the Opposition's speeches. I am astonished that the Minister has not yet grasped that point.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not entered into the spirit of things by enabling me to make a short speech. As he understands so clearly the difference between annual upratings and revaluations, it seems curious that "Fair Rates" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"we propose to make rolling revaluations each year".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman has often denied things that have appeared in Labour party documents. He said on 17 April 1991 that there would be no transitional relief under Labour's proposals because it was not needed. When I pointed out that the Labour party had committed itself to such revaluations in "Opportunity, Quality and Accountability", the hon. Gentleman denied it. But it is there, in black and white, on page 7. I note that the hon. Gentleman does not want to come back on that. We are left with a problem, the hon. Gentleman says that bands are objectionable in principle, but the hon. Member for Brightside said that there is no objection in principle to banding, provided that it is right.<br><br>
I wish to reply to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Dagenham. First, he accused the Government of choosing a banding system as a panic measure. No; we want a banding system because it has clear advantages. I set out those advantages in a speech last night and I do not intend to weary the Committee by listing them again. The system will give good value for money, and the valuations will be more long-lived. Banding will minimise the opportunity for appeal. It is absurd to base what people will pay in local authority taxation on the exact value of their properties. There should be some correlation with property prices, but it would be absurd to vary what people pay down to the last pound of property value.<br><br>
I said in my speech yesterday—which the hon. Gentleman has repeatedly chosen to misinterpret—that the ratios between the tax bands will dampen the effect of increases in tax as one goes up the property price scale. Thus, the increases in tax between one band and another will be more moderate than they would be under the sort of taxation system that the Labour party wants, where there would be no limit to the extra tax that people might have to pay at the higher end of the scale.<br><br>
The Labour party has been extraordinarily inconsistent. Our proposals, such as exempting students from the tax or giving a discount to single people, are necessary in the interests of fairness, but the Labour party cries out that they are massively complicated, that the tax would need a register and that we were going back to the poll tax. When we try to simplify the administration of the system by using a banding system, the Labour party says that we have fallen into another error. They seriously argue that they could deliver a taxation system that would be less expensive to administer. Even though "Fair Rates" states that Labour's valuation system would be based on four different measures of valuation and even though Labour proposes to make rolling revaluations each year, we are asked to believe that that would be administratively more cost-effective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard before the argument that the Government are introducing a simple tax that will be easy to understand and easy to administer. I have a sense of deja vu when I remember the poll tax Committee debates.</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a sense of deja vu because I have heard the hon. Gentleman say "déjà vu" so often before.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
The hon. Member for Dagenham, in a passage of extraordinary gullibility, quoted a letter from a valuer in Bath that he thought would demolish our case for a banded valuation system. Against that one valuer from Bath, I put 3,900 applications from valuers wanting to participate in the valuation exercise. From among those 3,900 valuers we have selected 2,300 who have been invited to tender. That represents 6,000 tenders for 1,200 different lots. Against the one valuer in Bath who has written to the hon. Gentleman, I can quote 3,900 valuers who have responded and who want to do the work.<br><br>
The Labour party claimed, in the hon. Gentleman's speech, to be aghast at the idea of the private sector taking on the valuation work, but in its document "Opportunity, Motherhood and Apple Pie", or whatever it was called, the Labour party said that it would allow
<br><blockquote><p>"professional valuers to use a range of factors to help"</p></blockquote>
in the task of valuation. So the Labour party is again being wholly inconsistent. I fear that the hon. Member for Dagenham has not read his own policy document.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the problem of disabled people. I say "briefly" because I had hoped that we would discuss this matter on an amendment of its own, but I think that there will be other opportunities in Committee to do so. My objective throughout the framing of the council tax —I speak as an ex-Minister in the Department of Social Security—has been to ensure that we do not require disabled people to pay more, on account of their disability, for adaptations to their property. That led me in August to issue regulations—and a press notice—allowing valuers to disregard certain improvements to properties to make them suitable for disabled people if such improvements would otherwise have increased the value of the property, but to take them into account if they reduce the value of the property.<br><br>
Organisations representing disabled people have suggested that we have not covered every conceivable situation and that some categories may need further consideration. For example, people who use their wheelchairs at home need turning space and storage space for the wheelchair. I make no commitment this evening, but serious discussions with groups representing disabled people are still taking place. I shall continue to approach the problem in a spirit of determination: that physically disabled people should not have to pay more on account of necessary alterations to their property. I hope that I shall have more to say on that matter at a future stage.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West was worried about agricultural properties, which have a lower market value because they are tied to agricultural activities. If a property has a lower market value because of legal constraints on its use, its lower value will be reflected in its valuation for the council tax. For example, a property that is subject to a planning consent restricting its use to occupation by agricultural workers is likely to have a lower market value than a similar property with no such restrictions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was also worried about farmers. The valuation will take account of the fact that a farmhouse is part of a working farm. Many working farmhouses have a lower market value than a similar house that is used for purely residential purposes. My hon. Friend will, I know, strongly support the provision to limit bills—three times as much for the most expensive property against the least expensive property in the district—because, if nothing else, that will be an important safeguard for people who happen

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
to live in expensive properties. I hope that she will be reassured about the way in which the use of the property is likely to be reflected in the market value that it will be given by the valuer.<br><br>
The Labour party's attitude during the debate has been to oppose what we have proposed, merely because we proposed it. Obviously, Labour Members have frequently considered the administrative advantages of banding and have committed themselves several times in print and speeches to examining the option of going for such a system. They have chosen, however, completely to ignore all the arguments that have been used in favour of a banding system. At heart, what they are aiming for was contained in almost the first sentence used by the hon. Member for Dagenham. They object to the ratios that we have imposed. In other words, they are worried that banding would restrict the way in which this tax could be used as an envy tax. They still want to squeeze every last penny out of people.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) thinks that the people of London have problems with a banded property tax, he should consider what his party's proposals would do for the rates that would have to be paid in London. Need I remind the hon. Gentleman that, in his borough of Waltham Forest when we last had rates, the rates bill for a four-bedroomed detached house was £1,234. Since then, we have taken £140 off the community charge, so one could knock something off for that. However, one could put something back on to that charge for two years of inflation. We must remember that the hon. Gentleman's party is committed to revaluation which, with no ceiling on what people would pay, would be absolutely disastrous for London.<br><br>
Before the hon. Gentleman criticises the Government, he should examine the proposals of his party, although I take it from the way in which he spoke that he has no expectation that they will ever be put into effect. On that point, I agree with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way because I want to get on to the next debate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch got it right when he quoted the interview between the hon. Member for Dagenham and David Frost. There is a matter of principle here. There is opposition for opposition's sake. We have devised a banding system that is administratively easier and more durable, which means that there is less need for revaluation. In particular, it enables us to provide a fair tax which asks that people in more expensive properties should pay more but not, as under the rates system in days of yore, that they should pay almost infinite extra amounts. We do not intend to squeeze every last penny out of people, on the ground that there might be someone in a more expensive property with an appropriate income.<br><br>
We recognise that although higher taxes should be paid by those in more expensive properties, there is no direct pound for pound correlation between the value of a person's property and his income. Again, I warn the Labour party that in making that false assumption it is treading on extremely perilous electoral ground. However, that is its lookout, not mine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is sometimes impressive to hear a Minister, or anyone else for that matter, winding up a debate in a seemingly off-the-cuff manner, without
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
apparent reference to notes or effort at preparation. However, there are occasions when a rather different impression is made by someone winding up a debate who makes no serious attempt to understand or grapple with the issues raised in it. I fear that this is just such an occasion.<br><br>
We heard a series of rambling observations from the Minister that repeated some of his prejudices, with which we are becoming familiar, but that made no attempt to deal with the serious and sincerely meant arguments presented by Opposition Members. In the interests of local government and local government taxpayers, we have done our best to alert the Government to the real problems that they are storing up. It is a matter of great regret that the Government are so purblind that they have refused to recognise that anything other than perfection could be involved in their proposals.<br><br>
The Minister dealt with the very real objections to banding as a means of setting in train an entirely new valuation register, which is what we are discussing, but showed no sign of recognising any of the problems. He simply repeated his earlier assertion that his proposals would produce value for money. No one would dispute that they would be cheap, but whether we would get value for money is another matter. He also claimed that his proposals would produce a long-lived set of valuations and reduce the number of appeals. That is a triumph of optimism over experience, and we will discover before long how misplaced that optimism is.<br><br>
The Minister defended the dampening of banding by saying that that was a means of achieving more moderate increases for those at the higher end of the scale. Of course that is true, and that is exactly our objection to it. The Minister may describe our proposal as an envy tax—one that displays an attitude of envy—but all that we are doing is carrying through to its proper conclusion the principle which, one assumes, the Minister has reluctantly been forced to adopt. The basis for liability, as we now understand from the Government, is to be the value of the property in which people live. If that is so, what is wrong with allowing the value of the property to reflect itself in that liability? That has nothing to do with envy—simple fairness and good sense dictates that outcome. It is the Minister who is fiddling around with the ordinary application—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty in listening to the hon. Gentleman because there is too much talking going on in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir Michael. I am sure that at least some Conservative Members may be interested in what I have to say, as it may be illuminating for them.<br><br>
The Minister's defence of the dampening of the banding system is no defence—it is an admission of guilt. That is what we find objectionable in the proposal and what leads to so many problems. The Minister would not have a debate on the problems of banding in the regions, which is to be the subject of our next debate, were it not for the fact that he has chosen a system of banding which compresses the liability and makes the range of bands inappropriate to so many regions of the country. That proposal produces all the difficulties of what is, in effect, in some parts of the country, a flat-rate tax. That proposal creates the problems of unfairness—the old principle of the poll tax. The defence that it is simply a means of creating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0139">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
moderation in increases for those at the top end of the scale is a statement of the obvious and a plea of guilty to the charge.<br><br>
The Minister then attempted to dismiss the evidence produced in a letter to me by a valuer in Bath. I understand why he is reluctant to accept such evidence. It is extremely damning and, particularly as it comes from Bath, it reflects that rising tide of discontent in that part of the country and elsewhere with all the Government's actions on this matter. He prayed in aid the fact that 3,900 firms had applied for pre-qualification, each of them, no doubt, desperate for the business. That was exactly the point made by my correspondent in Bath, who would maintain that many of them were applying in order to solve their cash flow problems, but without any real chance of carrying out the work at a satisfactory level.<br><br>
I welcome what the Minister said about the disabled. I am always willing to give the Minister credit when it is due, and I hope that what he said will be borne out by a fruitful outcome to the negotiations that he is conducting. I have every confidence that he will do his best to achieve such an outcome and I have faith in his ability to do so. I look forward to his coming to the Committee to tell us the outcome and being able to satisfy us that he has fulfilled the undertakings that he and some of his colleagues have given on this important subject.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) may agree with me when I say that I was less than totally satisfied with what the Minister said about agricultural property and tenant farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, she is more easily satisfied than I, and I am not sure that her constituents will thank her for being so easily fobbed off. The Minister did not grapple with the point that both she and I attempted to put before him.<br><br>
I conclude by reassuring my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen), although I am sure that he does not need reassurance. He should not be worried by the misleading information peddled by the Minister. If he compares the figures produced by the Government for their council tax with our fair rates figures, which, as he knows, have been confirmed by most independent experts, he will discover that—guess what—bills would be lower in Waltham Forest under the fair rates system than they will be under the council tax.<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
As the Minister shows no sign of heeding our warnings or recognising the dangers implicit in the crazy banding proposal, we have no alternative but to press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be fairly brief to allow other hon. Members to contribute to the debate.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is, first, to ensure that the banding proposed by the council tax is made fairer for those on low and average incomes. The problems caused by the bands presented in the Bill have already been rehearsed. Of course, we would prefer a local income tax, but we are stuck with the council tax. It is unfair that a millionaire in a mansion would pay only three times the sum paid by a person who lived in a bed-sit. We regard those proportions as totally unfair. Amendment No. 55 is designed to change them and we make no apology for it.<br><br>
London and the south-east have special problems and we want to tackle them. I shall cite figures from my constituency of Eastbourne, which has been mentioned in previous amendments, to demonstrate why the amendments are so important. Two adults in a household in Eastbourne, one earning and the other non-earning, currently pay poll tax of £548. However, despite the fact that the council tax would be cheaper than the aggregate of two poll tax payments, it is still expensive. In band C, the amount is £390, and in band D, £438. Those two bands contain the greatest number of hereditaments in the Eastbourne constituency.<br><br>
The local income tax for a household in Eastbourne with one earner and one non-earner—let us suppose that the earner is a teacher on £16,134 a year—would be £322·45. It is important to place that on record.<br><br>
In Eastbourne, the south-east, London and other areas of the United Kingdom, national banding will impose an unfair burden on people on low and average incomes who live in areas where properties have a high value. There are many such properties in London and the south-east. Let us consider the Government's figures. An average household in Hackney will pay £500. In Scarborough, a similar household will pay £346. The services provided by local government in each area are no different and the charge should be equal.<br><br>
In London, 1 per cent. only of homes will be in the lowest band; in the south-east, the figure is 6 per cent. and in the south-west it is 9 per cent. Yet in the north of England, 46 per cent. of homes will be in the lowest band. How can that offer equality of treatment to people in England? It means that far fewer bands will be available for homes in the south compared to those in the north. That will hit those in London and the south who are low wage earners.<br><br>
House prices vary enormously in different regions and regional banding would allow easier and fairer revaluations. There is considerable anger in the south-east about the Government's proposals. That is not too surprising because millions of people in that region will lose out as a result of the council tax proposals. Many of them are represented by Conservative Members of Parliament and I know that they share some of the anger being expressed. I hope that I may hear some of that anger in the debate, but if it is not voiced in the Committee I certainly expect to hear it on Report in the House if the Bill is returned unamended.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
The Government have claimed that there will be "quirky anomalies" in the boundaries between regions. Certainly, anomalies are a feature of any property tax but they are a particular feature of the council tax and we need to remove them. Regional banding would be fairer overall because it would allow lower bands to be established in low-priced property areas and higher bands in high-priced property areas.<br><br>
National banding creates bad examples of regional inequality. I have a list of them but I shall cite just one more in order to allow other hon. Members to speak. Let us consider the boundary between England and Wales. On one side of the Welsh border, a family in an average detached house will pay £490. On the other side, it would pay £199. There can be no equality of treatment of individuals who contribute to local taxation when such wide variations exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Janman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way because I want to leave time for other hon. Members to speak. The hon. Gentleman may contribute to the debate if he so wishes. I am nearing my conclusion and I hope that hon. Members appreciate that.<br><br>
It is not my fault that the Government have chosen to guillotine the debate. I shall make all the comments that I want to make and I hope that other hon. Members will have time to do the same. I tried to intervene twice today, but one hon. Member deliberately ignored my question and the other would not take the intervention.<br><br>
National banding produces unfair treatment across the United Kingdom, but it is most unfair in London and the south-east. The regional banding proposals set out in the amendment will at least produce a fairer opportunity for people to contribute to the council tax. Many of us believe the council tax to be inappropriate and horrendous, but we should all try to make it fairer. If the regional bands are accepted, they will undoubtedly present a fairer opportunity for people to contribute towards the council tax. The council tax must be improved and this is one way to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to follow the example of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) and keep my comments short, as many hon. Members want to contribute.<br><br>
There is, at first sight, an anomaly in having separate bands for Scotland and Wales and it seems justified only after one has analysed it. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will explain when he sums up the debate. The justification is based not least on the fact that there are three Secretaries of State, three different percentages of money being raised in the three countries to meet local expenditure as well as a number of other distinctions. There are sufficient distinctions to make a sound case.<br><br>
Having admitted that, I hear no case for extending the principle to all the English regions, not least because they are less defined. Moreover, there are not the same distinctions that exist between England, Scotland and Wales and, as I said briefly on Second Reading, there are major practical problems and ultimately it avoids the aim of the tax.<br><br>
The aim behind the amendment is essentially that someone in a house valued at £80,000 in the north of England should pay more than someone in an identically valued house in the south of England, assuming that in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
each case the council was spending in accordance with guidelines. If that is not what the hon. Member for Eastbourne means, I am not sure what he is saying.<br><br>
My argument is the reverse. We have a property tax. It is a property tax with a personal element, too and it meets a lower percentage than was the case under rates. Surely, people with £80,000 properties, wherever they are in England, should pay the same amount. My hon. Friends recognise the logic of that and I expect their support for it. The more one moves away from that argument, the more one is trying to defend the indefensible.<br><br>
There are major technical problems. In fairness, the hon. Member for Eastbourne said that prices vary considerably. They certainly do. There are significant variations within London and within Kent, Essex, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire, depending on whether one takes a richer or poorer area. There is no typical region. The more one examines the proposal in detail, the more difficult it is to justify it rationally. I cannot be justified in terms of morality or common justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Janman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend notice that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) rightly identified the massive disparity between what a person in England and a person in Wales would pay on properties of the same value, assuming a standard spending assessment in both places?<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the Government were already committed to the introduction of regional banding in the United Kingdom, which he rightly questioned at the beginning of his speech, and that the introduction of regional banding in England would create five, six, seven or 10 times the number of disparities within England, as opposed to the current disparities that exist between England, Scotland and Wales.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.<br><br>
The amendment provides for extra levels of banding at the higher level. I am fairly certain, although I should appreciate some confirmation from my hon. Friend the Minister, that the effect of more property bands at the higher level will be to increase what we used to term "resource reallocation" In plain English, that means that even though more money will be brought in, the relevant councils will find that more money will go elsewhere. I am sure that my hon. Friend will explain that in more elegant language.<br><br>
I conclude as I started. Regional banding will mean that owners of properties of the same value, but in different parts of England, will pay different amounts. That is not reasonable or fair and it will not seem fair to our electorate, so I shall vote against the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a brief word about Scottish banding, and tell hon. Members a small story to illustrate the absolute absurdity of the Government's proposals.<br><br>
I refer to the estate of one of Scotland's more distinguished visitors—if not the most distinguished—who visits Scotland each summer. There is a gardener's cottage on his estate, which is worth below £27,000 and which, therefore, is in the bottom tax band. As the estate is in an area of low taxation, the cottage will carry a tax of some £200. The castle on that estate is valued at above £212,000 and therefore, will carry a tax of, say, £600. It so happens that the castle of which I am talking is a second home. It is not the sole and main residence of the occupier. As a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
result, the tax paid on the castle is only £300. That £300 is the only tax that the castle's owner pays in the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Janman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendments No. 87 and 94, which I tabled in a probing spirit. I share the scepticism of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) for the idea of regional bands. Although I agree that separate banding for London would create more anomalies than is worthwhile, I understand why some of my hon. Friends should request separate bands for London when different bands already exist for other parts of the United Kingdom. London's population is as large as the total populations of Scotland and Wales. One could argue that the case for excepting London is as strong as for excepting Scotland and Wales. However, there is a stronger case for being consistent in the other direction —if there is not to be separate banding for London, there should not be separate banding for Scotland and Wales either.<br><br>
The figures show that anomalies would arise between people living in Berwick-upon-Tweed in England and those living just north of the border. Moreover, there may be a huge disparity between people in Hereford and people in Monmouth. Assuming that all local authorities involved spend according to their standard spending assessments, the two people, or more, who live in a £55,000 house in England would pay £356. In Scotland, they would pay £420, yet in Wales only £163. At the other end of the scale, two people in a house worth £220,000 in England would pay £668, while the inhabitants of a similar house in Scotland would pay £840, and in Wales only £272.<br><br>
That is an exmple of the regional banding that is being proposed. Is it defensible? I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister, with his great debating skills and ability, will be able to advance a very strong defence, but I shall be intrigued to hear it. The Government appear to have decided that the same percentage of properties in the respective total property markets of England, Wales and Scotland should be put into each of the eight band categories. Each country's property market is being assessed in a relative way, but surely a system that is based on property values requires an absolute system of banding. An £80,000 house in England, Scotland, Wales or anywhere else in the United Kingdom is still an £80,000 house. Logic dictates that assumptions made about the owners' ability to pay the commensurate tax should be unequivocal, regardless of where the people live. Of course, if the owners are on low income and are unable to pay, they will be taken care of by the rebate system, irrespective of whether they live in Scotland, Wales or England.<br><br>
In short, my opinion is the exact opposite of that of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti). A degree of complication and anomaly already exists as a result of regionalised banding in the United Kingdom. The last thing we should do is to move towards regional bandings in England, which would simply extrapolate the anomalies that I have identified between England and Scotland and between Scotland and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 67 proposes a lower valuation band for Scotland to take into account low house prices in the highlands and islands. The valuation of £27,000 is too high as a starter band. It would mean that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
39 per cent. of houses in Caithness would be in the first band, as would 32 per cent. in Ross, Cromarty and Skye and 33 per cent. in Sutherland. Only 3 per cent. of houses in those three districts would be in the top three bands.<br><br>
The bands simply do not reflect the true cost of housing in remote rural areas. Residents in the highlands will pay more than the value of their house suggests. In addition, they will be doubly discriminated against because the commercial valuation of property will presumably take into account the inflated prices that holiday home owners will pay in some of those areas, but which people who live and work there cannot afford to pay. We have seen not only in Scotland but in other parts of the United Kingdom the problems that are caused by holiday homes being bought and local communities priced out of the market. I do not have similar figures for the Western Isles, but the community there is facing horrendous problems, with the loss of jobs and services, following the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Everything possible should be done to help.<br><br>
One of the things about the poll tax that angered people in very remote rural areas—particularly those on the islands—was that often they were paying the same as those in urban areas, yet they did not have access to anything like the local authority services provided in urban areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that one factor that must be taken into account is that Scotland has more than one third of the United Kingdom's land mass, and that there are many islands and isolated areas? Scotland is not a region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I do not think that he was here last night when the Minister made an extraordinary mistake in referring to Scotland as a region.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman's point about the land mass of Scotland—he put his finger on the nub of the matter. A number of islands have to be catered for in my constituency of Argyll and Bute, and I know that that causes a great problem.<br><br>
I do not want to take up the Committee's time and I hope that the Minister will respond to my points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two Members of Parliament have got into trouble tonight because of the language that they have used—I am one of them and the Leader of the Opposition is the other. I at least will try to clean up my act.<br><br>
Regional banding is a misconceived idea. I understand why it has gained some popularity in London, but I think that that is for entirely misconceived reasons. There are a number of illogicalities in proposing a regional structure of banding, and I should like to give one as an example.<br><br>
For reasons which will be clear to the Committee, I was in Langbaurgh a few weeks ago. I was in Guisborough, which is a very lovely market town. Indeed, I saw some familiar faces from the Committee there. From looking in estate agents' windows in Guisborough, it is plain that the price of housing is similar to that in outer London. I represent an outer London constituency and so I can make the comparison. If a regional banding structure put Yorkshire into the bands that are being proposed by Liberal Democrat Members—at their lowest point, some £10,000 below London values—how would that make the system more fair? Such a patchwork quilt of different
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
prices and values is being proposed that it would be impossible to achieve a regional structure that was anything like fair. The issue needs to be re-examined.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
I am pleased to say that I today received a letter from the leader of the London borough of Harrow, councillor Donald Abbott who says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not support the regional banding proposed, for the reasons we discussed."</p></blockquote>
Those reasons were the reasons that I have just outlined. Councillor Abbott, as a very able council leader, sees the illogicality of the proposals of some other local government administrators in London. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local government must, however, acknowledge that introducing bands additional to the eight in the current proposals, or applying regional variants, may disturb the fundamentals of the tax."</p></blockquote>
That is my other crucial point. We propose a system, whereby those living in properties of the same value would pay the same amount for the delivery of the same quality services at the same value for money: that system is fair and easily defensible.<br><br>
Strangely, I am expected to support a regional banding structure and persuade the Government to adopt such a system because it would lower the bills of some of my constituents in outer London; as their Member of Parliament, I am told that I should naturally find that desirable. That would not be my duty as a Member of Parliament; we have a wider responsibility than that, a responsibility to produce a fair, reasonable, efficient system.<br><br>
If one wants to know what will happen to my constituents, one has simply to look at the figures. In 1989–1990, the last year of the rating system, the rates bill for a three bedroom semidetached house—which is, broadly, the median sort of house in my constituency— was £549. Last year's community charge bill was £506 for two people. So there was already a reduction under the community charge. This year's indicative figure for the council tax bill is £441. So it is not possible to argue that my constituents will be getting anything other than a good deal from the proposals put forward by the Minister.<br><br>
In the neighbouring borough of Brent, the figures for a three bedroomed semi-detached house are even more stark. I hesitate to reveal which party controlled Brent when the disaster ws upon it: in the last year of rates an occupant of tht kind of house paid £1,550. Under this year's community charge two people paid £656 and under the council tax, the indicative figure for this year is £517. The proposals are obviously fair to those people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The arguments that have been made for banding changes do not add up. In areas like that of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) and in my own area, there will inevitably be some loss of grant because there will be more properties in higher bands. But in our boroughs we know that good Conservative authorities will be able to counteract that loss by spending under target, as usual, and by implementing a charge that people in all bands can manage. I do not understand the argument of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) about too many properties being in the bottom band. In such cases, people will gain from the grant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a valuable point.<br><br>
Local government leaders in London have suggested several methods of putting the problem right. One
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
proposal is to return to the London equalisation scheme, but that scheme was predicated on business rates from the City of London and Westminster. It would not be possible to return to that or to the London discount scheme, which derived from London's property boom in the early and mid 1970s. London prices had become inflated and it would be illogical to return to that scheme. Of course, we want money to come into Harrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I must finish because of the time. The people of Harrow are used to a high level of service, but also to paying more than they otherwise would. They want that service to continue. This scheme will allow that and ensure that reasonable bills come through people's letter boxes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak to amendment No. 56. Those of us who were—and still are—not committed to a valuation system that uses samples and banding were interested to learn, this year, that Ministers were trying to find a fairer system than that which ultimately emerged. On 1 May, rating circular 53 was admitted to be an authentic document, four days after its existence had been denied. Rating circular 53 was issued on 22 February 1991; it instructed valuers to perform a desktop exercise using 14 bands rather than seven. No exercise was undertaken on seven bands until the beginning of May, when the Secretary of State denied that there had been 14 or nine-band exercises. The latter was carried out under rating circular 58 and was denied by both the Department of the Environment and Downing street until it was produced. Once produced, officials decided that it was better to admit its existence.<br><br>
These circulars are not incidental to our discussions because they show that the Department, and the Secretary of State, were interested in finding a system with a deal more fairness than that which we are debating. Amendment No. 56 lays out a scheme with 14 bands, with a bottom band of up to £15,000 and an upper band of £500,000, which deals with the problems described last night by my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). It is obviously more equitable and fairer than the eight-band system before us. The eighth band was added, as the Secretary of State put it in answer to a recent question, for psychological reasons, not because it made any difference to the system. In answer to a question from me last week, the Minister declined to exemplify the impact on the amounts to be paid of having eight bands. He said that the eighth band was insignificant and trivial.<br><br>
It is on record that the Government thought that 14 bands would have been fairer, then decided to have nine, then seven and now it has turned out that there are eight. If we must have a banding system of the sort desired by Conservative Members, it must be as broad as possible to be fair. Whatever the regional differentials, the unfairness as between different individuals and different families is at the root of the Bill's problems—as it was with the poll tax. That is why the council tax is similar to, and as flawed as, the poll tax, which will apply until April 1993.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) touched on the problem that the valuation system and the way that those values are spread affect resource allocation and resource equalisation. Those matters are crucial in determining what people have to pay, in ensuring fairness between families, and in balancing different parts of this country. I therefore hope that we shall discuss the matter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
later. If the Government had meant what they said in February, and carried it out, they might have produced a system that protected people on middle or low incomes, not those on high incomes. The Conservative party is committed to protecting the rich at the expense of the rest, and it deserves to lose the next general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was particularly gratified by the contributions to our debate by my hon. Friends the Members for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes), for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) and for Thurrock (Mr. Janman). My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West was right to point out that variations in property prices makes this a complex matter. For example, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti), 10 per cent. of properties are in band E, 4 per cent. in band F, and 3 per cent. in bands G and H. Each of those is well below the national average, although his constituency is in the south-east. However, the average three-bedroomed, semi-detached house in, for example, Stockport, South Lakeland, or elsewhere in the north of England, falls into band D, as it does in Oxford and Woking. In Milton Keynes or Eastbourne, a similar house would fall into band C. The problem is more difficult than some hon. Members would lead us to believe.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West raised the question of a special equalisation grant for London. He rightly recalled that the previous system was based on a business rating system that is no longer with us and is therefore no longer appropriate. He succinctly put the case against regional banding. Any special RSG arrangement for London would involve regional banding under another guise, and would be subject to the same anomalies and resentments that grow wherever one draws the boundaries of a regional banding system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I must protest, in the strongest possible way, about the fact that no Scottish—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch was right to say that the effect of the Opposition amendment to impose extra bands in London would increase the tax base, and less grant would be needed to bridge the gap between the tax base and his authority's spending. My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock was so enthusiastic in his denunciation of regional banding that he even denounced its use in Scotland and Wales.<br><br>
Scotland has a different system of law and of local government, and it has its own Secretary of State. If we changed the banding structure in Scotland and Wales, we should not change the money thereby raised. If the bands in Wales and Scotland were brought into line with those in England, more properties in Wales and Scotland would fall into the lower bands. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock wants that.<br><br>
The anomalies that a regional banding system would throw up are so absurd as to defeat the amendment that the Liberal Democrat party proposed. A couple in a £60,000 three-bedroomed semi in Northampton would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
have to pay £43 more than a couple in a similar house in Milton Keynes. People would be bound to ask why. In Hertsmere the bill on such a house would be £88 more than in neighbouring Enfield, and people would not understand why. In Salisbury, a couple in a three-bedroomed semi would pay £44 more than their neighbours in Test valley. Bills would also rise in Scarborough. For a couple living in a £60,000 house, bills would rise by £40.<br><br>
The anomalies thrown up by a regional banding system are indefensible. I therefore hope that the Committee will join me in decisively defeating the amendments.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'(subject to section <i>(Liability of Students)</i> below'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take new clause 2— <i>Liability of Students—</i></span></p>
<p>'()—(1) Persons engaged in full time or part-time education or training shall not be liable for the Council Tax.
<ol>
<li>The Secretary of State shall reimburse to a local authority costs incurred as a result of subsection (1).</li>
<li>The Secretary of State shall make regulations to secure any charges incurred by educational institutions, local authorities or other parties as a result of subsection (1) shall not be passed on to students in their housing costs or in other ways, and such regulations shall make provision for an appeal in any case where a student considers that the requirements of this subsection have been contravened.</li>
<li>The Secretary of State shall make arrangements to ensure that any costs incurred by educational institutions or other agencies validating the status of a person by virtue of subsection (1) above, shall be fully compensated for."</li>
</ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that we are a trifle jaded after our hours of discussion but that should not diminish the importance of the new clause and the amendment.<br><br>
The purpose of the new clause is to exempt full and part-time students in education and training from liability to the council tax, to ensure that the council tax is not passed on to students through rents, and to compensate local authorities and educational institutions for any loss of income.<br><br>
The Minister of State should be aware that these are probing amendments, initiated by bodies representing students throughout the United Kingdom, whose purpose is to discover the Government's intentions in respect of students.<br><br>
The Minister said earlier that one purpose of the banding arrangements, a principle underlying the council tax, was to act as an essential safeguard for those who happen to live in very expensive properties. That is obviously not the only reason for the introduction of the council tax; there are many others, including the fact that the poll tax had to be abandoned. If that is a raison d'être of the council tax, any discussion relating to students or to any other group of men and women must be put into a certain perspective. We are talking not about people who happen to live in very expensive properties but about one of the great tragedies of the poll tax.<br><br>
A few years ago, Sir Michael, you were the Chairman and I was a member of the Committee considering the poll tax. We discussed its effect on students then, although the Committee sat not for three weeks but for three months. For many weeks, members of that Committee considered how best to protect those youngsters—they are the future of this country—in respect of their liability to pay local taxation. We discussed one of the problems that led to the demise of the poll tax: its treatment of students was abysmal and disgraceful. Students reacted to that treatment more dramatically than any other sector of the community.<br><br>
Students had to pay a percentage of the poll tax, and colleges and universities were thrown into financial and administrative chaos as a direct result of the rules by which they had to deal with the poll tax and their students.<br><br>
An unnecessary and unfortunate distinction was made, in Committee and later, between education and training. From our valuable discussions today, it has emerged that that distinction is not now as acute. A youngster on a training scheme in a local community should not be treated any differently from someone at one of our ancient universities. Under the poll tax, there were problems with full-time and part-time students. The question of student
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
nurses was a cause célèbre at the time of the poll tax and will be under the council tax. Those problems should be seen as a backcloth to the individual financial plight of students.<br><br>
10.30 pm<br><br>
I am sure there is not one hon. Member who has not received, directly from constituents who are students or from parents of students, evidence of the hardship that students face at college or university.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify the hon. Gentleman's point on new clause 2. As I read it, it appears to give rise to the same problems as the Liberal Democrats had in defining who is a student, who is a part-time student and who is a trainee. New clause 2 does not require that a course be accredited and contains no reference to the type of institution, to students of the Open university or to trainees who are released from their employment for a week for a course. Can the hon. Gentleman relate the new clause to the reality of life?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I shall return in more detail to those points. I am only making my opening remarks. The Government should answer the important question that the hon. Gentleman has raised. The anomalies that occurred in the case of students and the poll tax created controversy and difficulties throughout the country.<br><br>
The problem of students and local taxation must be seen against the backcloth of the student loan system, the freezing of grants and the inability of many students to claim any sort of benefit. The combination of those factors means that students are disadvantaged by comparison with those who were students in the 1960s and later.<br><br>
The first point of new clause 2 is about students' liability for council tax. Our debate has been fruitful in many respects in defining what students' council tax liability will be, but there are still gaps. We need to examine the Government's claim that students will not add to a household's council tax bill because of the discounts. Clause 4, we have been promised, will make all-student dwellings exempt. The Minister has already mentioned halls of residence and ordinary dwellings.<br><br>
Students will be liable for council tax in some situations and I shall give the Committee some examples. Two students are co-tenants of a property. They are therefore at an equal level in the hierarchy of liability in clause 6. One of them ceases to be a student. The liability rises from zero to 75 per cent. At law, co-tenants are jointly and severally liable and the council could begin proceedings against either person in the event of non-payment.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales referred to his former secretary who is the owner of a property and a mature student. She will presumably be exempt from liability for the council tax. If she takes in a lodger, she will become liable for 75 per cent. of the council tax because as the owner she will be above the lodger in the clause 6 hierarchy. All sorts of difficulties and confusions will be rampant, what with the discounts, exemptions, liabilities and so on. The simpler the system for exemptions and students, the better.<br><br>
Subsection (2), which the Under-Secretary mentioned, raises the issue of the cost of discounts—about £780 million. Local authorities could incur costs of £780 million because of student exemptions from the council tax. That will particularly affect certain local authorities—Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester and Cardiff. The borough of Taff-Ely includes the only polytechnic in Wales. My hon.

Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) has often described the difficulties of small towns with large educational institutions, such as housing problems and the loss of income that would result if students were to be exempted from any contribution to local taxation. Subsection (2) deals with the income of local authorities if major exemptions from liability are given to students. Local authorities have to deal with fluid populations where there are thousands of students. Central Government could reimburse the local authority, presumably by then a unitary authority, for the loss of income.<br><br>
Subsection (3) would prevent the additional costs of educational institutions, local authorities and other parties incurred through student exemptions from being passed on to students in higher housing costs or in other ways. The problems with that is exemplified by the poll tax. Many people's rents had incorporated the old rates. When rates were abolished and the poll tax was introduced, landlords did not necessarily reduce rents, so there was a hidden rental increase for many tenants, including students. Subsection (3) would ensure that if students benefited from exemption from liability, they would not have extra housing or rental costs imposed upon them. Private landlords, such as educational institutions, could be liable for either the council tax or non-domestic rates. Subsection (3) would also create an appeal system whereby individual students could appeal if they believed that charges had been passed on to them by any of the three bodies stipulated.<br><br>
Subsection (4) deals with costs incurred by colleges and universities for the administration of validating people as students. At a time of increasing cuts, the increased costs of higher education institutions are horrendous. If the cost of validating people as exempt from local taxation falls upon educational institutions, those institutions should have money allocated to them to cover it. Subsection (4) would ensure that institutions or other agencies would be fully reimbursed for such costs.<br><br>
The new clause would ensure that students would not be liable for any costs passed on to them through the administration of student exemption, loss of revenue or landlord liability for the council tax or non-domestic rates. Any change would be for the better, but the essence of such a change must be simplicity and fairness. The new clause has not been tabled to embarrass the Government or to cause any division but to seek clarification on the matters that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Dr. Hampson) leapt to his feet—I thought rather prematurely—to congratulate the Government on making exemptions for all students. Perhaps that was because he feels that he represents the university area of Leeds, but when I checked the figures I found that most of the student population in Leeds live in terraced houses in Kirkstall and Burley in my constituency. Leeds has a large university, a polytechnic and a teaching hospital and its student population is about 20,000.<br><br>
As a result of the Government's introduction of the students' loan system, students are already under pressure. They have been hammered by the 20 per cent. rule where that has been applied under the poll tax and they face real hardship. The new clause seeks clarification on whether all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
students are exempt from the council tax, as the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West announced with such euphoria. If that is true, it should be plainly stated, but the Bill is ambiguous.<br><br>
It has been said that students in halls of residence will be exempt, but the number in halls of residence in Leeds is very small, because there is a shortage of such accommodation. Leeds university can guarantee a place in a hall of residence only to first-year students; after that students have to move into private rented accommodation. Students at the polytechnic are often housed in the gymnasium for the first few weeks of term, until the private rented market settles down. There is always a severe accommodation problem for students in Leeds. Not all students—<i>[Interruption.]</i> It may be true that university students are there for only three years, but polytechnics do not have as many halls of residence as universities. A huge number of students need to be housed in Leeds, as the figures show.<br><br>
Furthermore, not all students live in student-only dwellings. Some live in houses where the landlord is resident and others in houses of multiple occupancy which they share with other tenants. And there lies the problem, because in such cases the tax will be passed on to the students.<br><br>
What would happen in a household of multiple occupancy if one person was working and the other was a student and if both paid rent to the same landlord? Let us suppose that one person of a partnership is a student and the other either unemployed or working. Who would pay the council tax? We need clarification on the joint and several liability provisions.<br><br>
At present, it is difficult to persuade young people to take up courses of further and higher education and we should not put barriers in their way. If the burdens of the poll tax are carried through to the council tax, young people may be priced out of the opportunity to take up courses. Surely that is the most shortsighted policy possible, given that we want to extend training and move the economy forward in a positive direction. Surely the Committee can agree that we should be encouraging young people to take up courses rather than discouraging them by imposing financial barriers. If hon. Members dissent from that, I am sure that they will say so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about encouraging people to take up tertiary education, but the figures show that the number of people going into university education has increased over the past 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but might care to relate that rise to the size of the population, the increased birth rate and the number of people who, as I discovered when I checked last week, have resigned their courses because—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Come on, let us have an anecdote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not an anecdote, it is a fact. The loans system is not working. Students who are unable to pay their rent are being evicted and are therefore leaving their courses. Hon. Members who do not believe that should check with colleges and universities, which will confirm that what I have said is a fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be more than happy to go with the hon. Gentleman to the educational establishment of his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
choice to check on the truth of the matter. I am absolutely sure that, throughout the country, more students are leaving their courses because their loans are not coming through and so they cannot pay their rent. Does the hon. Gentleman still deny that fact?</span></p>
<p>10.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that the rise has not been confined to the absolute number of students. The proportion of students as a percentage of the population has risen substantially, and that proportion is forecast to rise again in the next couple of years.<br><br>
Secondly, will the hon. Gentleman say whether he knows of another country anywhere in the developed world, apart from the Republic of Ireland, where the package of support for students is as generous as it is in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Sir Michael, would rule me out of order if I were to outline the conditions of assistance for students in Germany, Japan or France, for example—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is far too much discussion from a sedentary position. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has made his comments and will doubtless make further comments but I ask him then to return to the amendment. Moreover, I request that there be no further interventions from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that there is much discussion from a sedentary position, Sir Michael, although assertions seem to be tossed across the Room at me. But I am staggered by what I have heard. I had thought that what is happening to students in Britain would be blindingly obvious to any hon. Members who read the newspapers or even looked at their mail. I had thought that that was accepted, given that the banking institutions have informed us of the difficulties that students face and that the landlords associations in Leeds have asked to meet Members of Parliament because landlords are being forced to evict students as a result of the problems in the grant system. I am slightly surprised to discover that Conservative Members are so out of touch. However, I know that you, Sir Michael, will rule me out of order if I pursue that line of argument in any further detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall only rule the hon. Gentleman out of order if he is out of order. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that his remarks can be firmly attached to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that ruling, Sir Michael. However, if the Committee cannot agree that students are suffering as a result of the changes in financial arrangements—that is to state the matter neutrally—can we agree at least that the rules under this Bill should be clearly understood and should be plain and easily implementable? That was not the case with the poll tax, and I am not sure that it is yet true of the Bill as it stands. The amendment suggests that the Government should clarify the position and make it absolutely plain so that students, and the whole educational establishment, know where they stand.<br><br>
Students are perhaps the most mobile sector of the population. I know that from the numbers of students who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
move house from term to term. They do not stay in the same place for long. That is part of the problem with the collection of the poll tax, which proved to be an absolute nightmare for local authorities. When people say that local authorities have not managed to collect the poll tax, they might like to relate the figures for non-collection to the number of students in those areas. That analysis shows how some authorities have done a very difficult task incredibly well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, it might be simpler under the new system, which provides that if premises are used wholly for students they are exempt. If premises are used partly for students, the owner, freeholder or landlord can apply to have the student population of those premises disregarded.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for Leeds, West and I were students living in halls of residence, our hall paid rates which were passed on to us in our rent. When we moved into digs, our landladies paid rates, which similarly were passed on to us. Under the council tax, students in halls of residence will be totally exempt and students in digs will be disregarded. If a landlady living on her own takes in a student who is disregarded, she will pay a discounted amount. There will not be the same burden passed on to students as when the hon. Gentleman and I were students.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful suggestion, although I must point out that I have never lived in halls of residence. However, I understand how the rates were passed on in the rent.<br><br>
We must ensure that students are not discriminated against because they cannot find a flat in which everyone else is a student. Some will have to accept that they must live with other people. It is unfair that they should suffer discrimination as a result.<br><br>
What the hon. Gentleman suggests is not what the Bill provides—would that it were, with one proviso: that the landlord is not in the pivotal position of deciding whether to apply. In some cases, students could still have to pay because the landlord had not ensured that the benefit flowed through to them. If that guarantee was built in, it could go some way towards meeting the intention of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although there are good intentions behind what the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) said, unless there is some mechanism to ensure that landladies and landlords reduce the costs to students pro rata, the system will not work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recommend that hon. Members read new clause 2, which emphasises that the benefit should be passed to the student. We want an absolute assurance, before guarantees can be given by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West who, I am sure, will be distributing leaflets in his constituency that suggest that he has won exemption for all students. If the Minister can give us that guarantee, I will accept it and we will have achieved something in this poll tax row. Young people in education should not be penalised.<br><br>
It is ludicrous for a local authority to spend time trying to raise revenue by chasing students, given the number of times that they change addresses. For example, under the poll tax, students could choose whether they were charged at their primary or secondary residence. Local authorities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
were losing money hand over fist chasing small amounts from students. Local authorities do not need such lunatic economics imposed on them.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will make it plain that students who can prove that they are students, which is quite easy to do, are exempt from the council tax. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will at least accept the spirit of the amendment, if not the wording, and will give us the assurances that we seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. McCartney.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, a filibuster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put the Minister's mind at rest; I never filibuster. I genuinely attempt to get a result from the Government. So far it is something like 499:1 against. I once got a result from the former Secretary of State for Energy and perhaps that is why he resigned from his life in politics.<br><br>
I rise to speak for two main reasons. First, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) has asked me to. Secondly, I want to return to the issue of students. I do not want to repeat all the arguments about student nurses but there are a few points that I should like to clarify. I am sure that the Minister wanted to cut short that debate because of his personal embarrassment about his high-handed rejection of even the minimal demands. I shall return to that later but I will not repeat myself.<br><br>
I have heard the Minister's comments about the general principle but I am not prepared to allow it to lie there. I am still waiting for the Minister to clarify certain aspects relating particularly to student nurses who come into the schools via the district health authorities.<br><br>
I should like to deal with the views of the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation. Tory Members get upset when Opposition Members quote from professional organisations with no political affiliation because they cannot then accuse us of political filibustering. The points that we quote are made by organisations that have no direct or indirect links with Opposition parties but with a professional interest in the subject. The evidence that they provide about the shortcomings of the Bill are therefore worthy of consideration.<br><br>
The IRRV has a wide membership drawn from local authority valuers and professionals in the private sector. It therefore has unique insight into aspects of the Bill. I was interested to receive a letter in the past few days from the director of the institute, Colin Farrington, about the status of student discounts. I assume that the letter has been sent to other members of the Committee but that Tory Members have chosen to ignore the professional advice contained in it. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is important to recognise that local authorities must be able to clearly identify valid claims of student status for discount purposes. A certification process, as was used for community charge, has been allowed with respect to Scotland, but not England and Wales. There is no apparent logic to this."—</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister could respond to that later. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The same powers should be provided for in England and Wales as in Scotland. We do not accept the argument that a certification process would not be feasible due to the different types of students falling into the discount category (eg youth training trainees, apprentices)."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
To that could be added the different status for nurses. It goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"The certification process could be extended to require returns from employers in these cases; at least, the power to require verification from appointed officers of educational establishments should be retained, as it has been in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is not here because this is the first time that we shall be able to speak about retaining some aspects of the Scottish legislation. The letter went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Additionally, the provision of a special residence rule for students should be retained to cover changes in residence from term-time to vacation-time, between different local authority areas. Even if students are to be disregarded for purposes of this tax, it would be administratively expedient to have students defined as resident through out the academic year in the area in which they live at the start of the year in order to carry out their course of study."</p></blockquote>
Has the Minister any views on that submission from the association? Has the association written to him directly and, if so, has he responded?<br><br>
11 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) has rightly set out three clear objectives in amendment No. 95 and new clause 2. The first objective is to exempt full and part-time students in education and training from the liability of the council tax and to ensure that the council tax is not passed on to students in their rent. Students sometimes live in flats that are also occupied by non-students. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) was right to point out the realities of student life at—as it were—the coal face. Students have to seek accommodation wherever they can. Because of the changes in rent policies and the sale of student accommodation, students have been forced to seek accommodation in the private sector, sometimes sharing it with non-students. We must ensure that a student is not required to make a contribution towards the council tax for a shared property. In some areas, the pressure for private rented accommodation is exacerbated by many students chasing few lettings.<br><br>
The amendment proposes to compensate local authorities and education institutions for any loss of income. My hon. Friend for Torfaen said that a substantial amount of resources would be lost unless the Government made clear the way in which local authorities would be reimbursed.<br><br>
When I was a member of a local authority, I remember housing benefit regulations being introduced and how the regime operated. There were shortfalls of millions of pounds for medium-sized local authorities such as mine in a metropolitan area. In the first six months of the scheme's operation there was a shortfall of more than £1 million because of the way in which the Government introduced it. The interpretation of the rebates system left the local authority to make good the Government's miscalculation. Two years after its introduction, major changes were proposed in the House to take account of the shortfall. The housing benefit scheme was encountering difficulties because of it. We do not want to repeat the experience of local authorities and introduce a new discount scheme relating to benefits when local authorities are expected to carry out the Government's functions.<br><br>
It is also important to raise the issue of bureaucracy, particularly in relation to what local authorities are being asked to do in identifying students and collecting the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
council tax. The Government have deliberately tagged nursing students as employees as an excuse to exclude them from the benefits that the legislation will give the 7,500 nurses in Project 2000. The former Prime Minister was implacably opposed to any amendments to the original poll tax Bill that would recognise the rights of student nurses. Amendments in the other place forced the Government to compromise on community charge exemptions for students.<br><br>
The Government have learnt that lesson and are now imposing the phoney employee tag on 55,000 student nurses. By doing so, those nurses will be excluded from their right of exemption from the council tax. That will leave local authorities with a difficult task. Collecting the council tax from students will be difficult; collection officers must identify student-only households and differentiate them from houses that students share with non-students. Unless the Government accept the concept of amalgamating the provisions relating to the two sets of student nurses, local authorities will be left to deal with the anomaly of one type of student nurse, who has come through a local health authority, and another, who has come through the Department of Health, eventually working together in the same hospital and same ward. Therefore, it is vital that the Government respond to this issue.<br><br>
On page 41 of the report produced by CSL, which is a summary of the Bill produced on behalf of the Department of the Environment, the Government's position on social security council tax benefits is set out clearly and that is important for the debate on students. When the Government responded earlier to this issue, the Minister stated that there was a clear defining line between Project 2000 students and students employed directly by the health authority because those 55,000 student nurses would be eligible for assistance through the benefit system. I want to show why that is not the case.<br><br>
The CSL report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 when published will be amended to cover the administration of council tax benefit.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Authorities will take appropriate steps to make people who are eligible for council tax benefit aware that they are eligible.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A person will be entitled to benefit if there is an appropriate maximum council tax benefit in his case and he has no income, his income is less than his applicable amount or A exceeds B where:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A is the appropriate maximum council tax benefit in his case.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>B is a prescribed percentage of the difference between his income for the week and the applicable amount."</p></blockquote>
That seems fair. However, the equation's implication for nurses means that it is impossible for the 55,000 student nurses, who are deemed employees, to overcome the hurdle posed by A and B. The figures provided by the Royal College of Nursing show that the employee earns, on a average, after tax and deduction, £96.83. That is approximately between £55 and £56 above the figure needed to fall within the calculations set out in the CSL report. The Government peddle, not an illusion, but a complete untruth when they claim that those 55,000 students are as well protected as the 7,500 students in Project 2000. The Government owe the Committee an explanation for their failure to negotiate with the Department of Health a formula to cover that group of 55,000 nurses. That group will reduce in size annually until it is eliminated.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
If the Government are not prepared to provide such a formula, perhaps they will give us other assurances about those students in that group of 55,000 who would find it difficult to pay their council tax. Do the Government intend to enforce payment under schedule 4 by deductions from income? Will they issue distress warrants or impose charging orders? Will the Government, through the district health authorities, impose an attachment of earnings provision on nurses who find it difficult to pay the council tax? That could lead to outright hostility from a key group of workers in the national health service. That is the wrong message to send at a time when we are trying to provide for students a career structure in and access to the national health service. The Government should, later in our proceedings, present ideas for transitional arrangements for the 55,000 employee students.<br><br>
I wish to make a suggestion, but I do not know whether it is feasible. I do not claim that the suggestion should definitely be adopted, but it costs the Government nothing to consider an idea, even if the Minister returns to the Committee and ridicules it. The Minister could ask the Secretary of State for Health for a detailed timetable for phasing out the 55,000 so-called employee students until every student is part of Project 2000. He could then provide a time scale for transitional arrangements for payments of the council tax during that period, so that no student nurse, irrespective of their position in the training scheme, was treated differently from the others. That seems a reasonable proposition for the Government to consider even if they decide that it is unworkable.<br><br>
11.15 pm<br><br>
Transitional arrangements are not an unusual feature of the Government's policies in respect of changing systems and benefits. When he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the Minister was involved in the development of ideas for transitional arrangements for benefits. As a member of the Select Committee on Social Security, I was involved only last week in discussions about the continuing need for such transitional arrangements for the benefit system. The idea is not unique: the Government understand it and have and are continuing to implement it in certain policies. They do so when it suits them. Therefore, I ask them to consider such arrangements as a possible means of overcoming a serious anomaly that has been thrown up because of the poll tax legislation and the then need of the Government to take account of amendments passed in another place. However, I should not like the other place to table another set of amendments that we would have to consider later. Perhaps the Minister will second-guess the other place and come back with suggestions to meet the practical points that I raised about nurses who have been designated as employees instead of student nurses.<br><br>
It is significant that the CSL report made no differentiation for student nurses. In each section dealing with students, it did not differentiate between student nurses on Project 2000 and student nurse employees: it dealt simply with student nurses. The Minister should reconsider that lack of differentiation.<br><br>
Finally—I do not wish to be accused of filibustering because that was never my intention—I ask the Minister to think about some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) about students whom the Government are attempting to place in housing in that sector of the market where there is a serious lack of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
accommodation. We hope that that policy will not be used by unscrupulous landlords as a means by which students are asked to pay part of the burden of community tax obligations.<br><br>
In another guise, the Minister had responsibility for housing matters. He may still have a responsibility, if only to say hello to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). Serious problems occur when there is a lack of housing if people try to take advantage of those who seek to gain access to the market place. Abuse may take the form of asking for additional payments to secure a tenancy.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) was a student and he has also been involved in housing in a professional capacity for a decade or more. A few weeks ago the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities opened a new housing estate in my constituency, and did it well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it still open?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West used to be a social worker in that part of the estate. He knows from the underground what happens when people need accommodation, and of the pressure that they are under. Perhaps the Minister will take those pressures into account. I also hope that he will respond to my comments about student nurses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendment and the debate about students and the council tax as a means of obtaining clarification of certain points from the Minister.<br><br>
The wording of the Bill in relation to students is almost impenetrable. The point about students, among other categories, being disregarded is not at all clear. I thought that disregarded for discount meant eligible for discount. But there seems to be a turn-round of two negatives somewhere. Rather than saying that people are disregarded for discount, surely it would be better to say that they are eligible for discount. When we have the countless amendments that the Government will eventually put through this Committee, perhaps they could simplify that silly nonsense of the two negatives. There is something similar in the data protection legislation. But a two-negative approach does legislation no credit at all. Let us bring some simplicity into the Bill and say that students and other categories are eligible for discounts.<br><br>
The CSL report makes little reference to students. But I mention this reference so that the Minister and other members of the Committee can say whether it is clear to them. Paragraphs 11.1 to 11.4 state:
<br><blockquote><p>"The tax payable will be discounted by 25 per cent. (the 'appropriate percentage') if there is only one resident and he is not 'disregarded' or if there are two or more residents and all but one of them are disregarded for the purposes of the discount."</p></blockquote>
Is that clear? It is as clear as mud.<br><br>
Can the Minister find a way to remove the double-negative approach, to simplify the matter and state that students are eligible? It is part of the problem.<br><br>
Again, I ask for clarification of what the Minister said on Second Reading. To paraphrase, he said, "Joy, oh joy". Well, he did not quite say that, but he said that students are invisible for this tax. What does that mean? As I understand it, many students will have to pay the tax. How can they be invisible, to use the Minister's phrase? Surely it would be better to say that students are exempt from the tax and take them out altogether. That would also benefit the bureaucracy, which would have to collect the tax.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Janman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister was referring to those students who do not wish to join the National Union of Students. If they do not join, they become invisible because they are not allowed to do their course— <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we do not have a debate on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the Tory record, the Tory vote among students will probably be invisible at the next election.<br><br>
Will the Minister clarify the term "invisible"? Why cannot the Minister say that they are exempt? Is it because they are not exempt?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be surprised at this. The tax is on property, with a personal element. If the hon. Gentleman wants students to be exempt, he should advocate a personal tax, which is what we have at the moment. But I believe that the hon. Gentleman has opposed that for the past couple of years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a hybrid tax. In justifying the tax, the Minister said that it is a property and personal tax. The discounts involve a personal element. It is recognised that there are categories—for example, single people—who should receive discount. Therefore, why cannot we have a proper system for students? Let us recognise that their circumstances are special. We want to train them; they represent the future of our country. Whatever arguments bounce across the Floor of the House, we know that many students are hard up while pursuing their studies and they must spend a lot of money on books.<br><br>
Let us say that students should not pay this tax. Let us simply write into the Bill that they are exempt. Why cannot the Minister do that? If he has an objection, surely the phrase about them being invisible is nonsense if they are to be charged the tax. Will the Minister clarify that point?<br><br>
Further, why is the Minister interfering with the love lives of students? The disregarding, or eligibility for discount for students applies only if they are living in student-only homes. If they are not, and other people in the household have to pay the tax, problems arise. For example, if students are sharing accommodation with a landlord or landlady their single person allowance will be lost. If a student is sharing with another student—a girlfriend or a boyfriend—he will not pay the tax. If he is sharing with a partner who is not a student he will have to pay the tax and the other person, his partner, will also pay tax and not receive a discount. That will be a disincentive to take a student as a lover. It is an interference in people's lives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is a sign of the moral indignation of the right wing of the Tory party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. Clearly the Tory party only want students to have lovers who are students. That is inbreeding. We already know that there is inbreeding in the Tory artistocracy but surely we do not want that in society as a whole.<br><br>
I see in the CSL report that the proposed discount is 50 per cent. If there are no residents, and if there are they will all be disregarded for the purposes of discount. If a couple of students share accommodation and one of them has a partner or lover who is not a student he will not receive the 50 per cent. discount.<br><br>
I am not saying that the Government deliberately sought to interfere with student relationships but the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
legislation has been drafted in such a way that that will be a side effect. Will the Minister look at the legislation to see if he can get over that problem? The best way to do that is to make all students exempt, no matter where they live, and to give anyone with whom they are living the right to receive a 50 per cent., or 25 per cent., discount. That is the key point of my speech. I do not think that the Minister should interfere with students' love lives.<br><br>
The Government are not treating students equally. It is unfair to treat students living in halls of residence differently from those who share accommodation with a landlord or a landlady. The hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) often says in the House how wonderful it is to have a friendly landlady. Although that statement receives laughs from both sides of the House, I have sympathy with her point. But there is a danger that that friendly landlady could lose the discount that she would have received if her home were a single person household.<br><br>
Will the Minister guarantee that a landlady with a student—or even a non-student—will still receive the discount? If not, there is a real danger of students facing higher rents.<br><br>
11.30 pm<br><br>
Students outside halls of residence are to be treated differently, but there is not enough accommodation in halls of residences in big cities such as London. Inevitably students have to find private rented accommodation. So the Bill is unfair to students in those circumstances. Will the Minister deal with that?<br><br>
Another offshoot of the problem is that a single person with whom students are living is likely to lose discount, which will put pressure on students not to declare and to come off the voting register. We have already faced that problem with the poll tax. Will the Minister give an assurance that we will not have to go through it again? There is no incentive for students to ensure that they are on the electoral register.<br><br>
I intended to speak about the RCN but my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) has already dealt with the issue very well. However, I shall cite what the RCN said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This unequal treatment has caused widespread bitterness and resentment among nursing students. The anomaly has no logical basis whatsoever … all nursing students should be treated equally under the council tax to avoid a repetition of the difficulties caused for nursing students by the community charge."</p></blockquote>
There should not be such a difference between Project 2000 and other student nurses.<br><br>
Finally, there is the question of who exactly is a student. Schedule 1 deals with that. It describes students as apprentices, students, student nurses and youth training trainees. But there should be further clarification of the problem.<br><br>
The Government gave an assurance that they would provide a job or a place on a youth training programme for every young person. Yet figures show that the Government have not met that guarantee. In my area, there are about 100 young people who have neither a job nor a youth training place. That is the Government's fault; and because those young people do not have a place they will not be counted as students and will be disregarded from the discount scheme. That must be wrong, and the Minister should consider the problem again. He should write into the Bill a commitment that young people to whom the Government have not met their obligations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
should be classified as students despite their invisibility. Even better, we should discard the notion of invisibility and deal with exemptions instead. I strongly urge the Minister to recognise the problem and take action on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a shame that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was not present during our deliberations. He would have delighted in yelling, "Déjà vu" as he heard the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) make the same speech for the second time the same day—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I object to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did so under the skilful guidance of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy). The hon. Member for Makerfield did not disappoint the hon. Member for Rutherglen. We missed the hon. Member for Cathcart and Scotsmen now abed will think themselves accursed that they were not here this evening.<br><br>
I am in the businsess of instant gratification whenever I can deliver it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and the Minister's comment on Scotsmen abed being accursed, the hon. Gentleman may like to know that my hon. Friend, perhaps to his chagrin, was born in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the original quotation from Shakespeare would have done as well.<br><br>
I return to instant gratification. The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) referred to Youth Training Scheme trainees who are guaranteed a place and are not eligible for benefit. Under the Bill, those 16 and 17-year-olds will not have to pay council tax.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton was also concerned about a landlady's bill if she has a student tenant. It will not increase. If a student or students are living with her, her bill will not change. In that context, the students are invisible. That is a good phrase and conveys the meaning very well. I am only sorry that it does not seem to have conveyed the meaning to the hon. Member for Leyton. Perhaps now that I have repeated the point, it will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister an example? If a landlady has a student living with her and the student has a girl friend or boy friend who is not a student, will her bill change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a non-student lodger brings in a girl friend or boy friend who is a student, the bill will not change because students are invisible. Their love life may be less interesting if they are invisible, but the bill will not change.<br><br>
My next piece of gratification is for the hon. Member for Makerfield who was keen that the system of certification of students should spread from Scotland to England and Wales. If he looks at the amendment paper, he will see that amendments Nos. 118 to 121, which have magically appeared in my name, would give effect to that. The average to which the hon. Gentleman referred earlier has now risen to 499:2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Janman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene as a voyeur in the debate between my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen). I want to ensure that my hon. Friend has not accidently misled the hon. Gentleman.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
In the landlady example, if the student lodger has a girl friend or boy friend who is not a student, presumably the landlady would lose her 25 per cent. discount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a single landlady takes in a non-student lodger she is no longer entitled to a 25 per cent. discount, whether or not that lodger brings in a student or non-student. That is logical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke so briefly that he feels he must make up for it by intervening now, so I give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps assuming that the landlady's lodger is a non-student, but the lodger may be a student and the landlady would then be entitled to the 25 per cent. discount. If her student had a partner who was not a student, she would immediately lose her 25 per cent. discount. Does that not amount to interfering with the student's love life?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not, because the arrival in a household of a non-student would put up the bill, whether or not the non-student lived with the student. For the purposes of the provision, the student is not only invisible but irrelevant, which may make things very uninteresting indeed.<br><br>
By far the most outstanding contributions to the debate were a couple of interventions from my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis). He seared his way through the problem and shed daylight on it. My hon. Friend said that the new clause was too widely drawn, and I agree. Subsection (1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Persons engaged in full time or part-time education or training shall not be liable for the Council Tax."</p></blockquote>
To be exempt from the council tax, students must be engaged in at least 21 hours of education a week at a qualifying institution for at least 24 weeks a year. That is the standard definition of a "student". Surely, on reflection, Opposition Members would not really want to extend the non-liability to people in training and those in part-time education. The proposal is possibly a slip of the pen.<br><br>
Judging by the wording of subsection (2) of the new clause, it seems that we are going much further than the Opposition want us to go. Many students will not bring about a loss to local authorities. They will be living in properties for which a council tax was already being paid, for example, if they were living with their mother or father, or a landlady and her husband. In many circumstances, the fact that discounts are given to students will cause no loss to the local authority.<br><br>
What will happen—as it does under the community charge—is that local authorities will assess how many students are on their registers and calculate what difference that makes to their tax base. That tax base would be lower than it otherwise would have been and the difference between their tax base and their standard spending assessment will be made up to them in redistributed business rates and rate support grant. The lower the tax base of local authorities, the higher the payments of RSG.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is right, but the calculation that will be required of local authorities is more complicated than the process that he described. Not only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
will they have to assess the number of students, but they will have to guess the circumstances in which the students are living. Whether the students are living in accommodation that is exclusive to them, whether they are sharing with non-students and how many people they are sharing with is a complicated calculation, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is no different from the calculation that local authorities will make about the number of single discounts that will have to be given. They will be dealing with students who are eligible for single discounts or those who live in halls of residence and who are, therefore, exempt. The local authorities will estimate the number of students who are wholly exempt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not just a matter of counting the number of students.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but local authorities will estimate how many students fall into each category.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton said that all students should be exempt. That could be done only under a personal tax. We are not discussing a personal tax. Furthermore, the hon. Gentleman does not want a personal tax; he argued for its removal. As a consequence of the Bill, we must consider what happens to properties in which there are students. The hon. Gentleman described what he thought would be a desirable situation. I thought that that was a most lucid description of the Government's proposals. In other words, students should not pay the tax when they live together as students and, when they live with people who are not students, they should not add to the bill of the non-student population. I hope that my analysis of what happens with landlords and landladies reassures the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p>11.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A landlord who has a furnished, empty dwelling would pay two charges, but if he told the local authority that the property was tenanted by students, he would pay no charges. How can the local authority check on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The local authority would want to ensure that that was the case in just the same way as it would check on other circumstances. At the moment, the local authority has the right to check claims that properties are not sole or principal residences. Under rating law, the local authority had the right to check a declaration that a property was empty. If a landlord declares that a property is full of students, the local authority will have the right to check. Fraudulent declarations made in connection with the council tax could be penalised. That would include people who fraudulently applied for a single-person discount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend just said will be a great help to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), who said how worried he was about homeless students. My hon. Friend has given clear encouragement to landladies and landlords to put students into accommodation. In so doing, they will pay less to the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a most interesting and valid point. I know that he was itching to tell the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) that the number of people going into further education has risen from one in five in 1979 to one in five now and that it will shortly be one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
in four. It caused some hilarity among Conservative Members when the hon. Member for Leeds, West said that it was due to the explosion in the birth rate. If more people born 17 or 18 years ago are now students, and one in five are going into higher education, the number of places created for those people must be even greater than if the birth rate had fallen. The hon. Gentleman's point was rather counter-productive—and my point is likely to lead me into trouble, so I shall move on.<br><br>
New clause 2(3) states that local authorities and education institutions shall not pass on council tax liability to their students. However, education institutions with halls of residence will pay no council tax, because the halls of residence will be filled entirely with students. Continuing my theme of trying to please those hon. Members who have spoken, our proposals go further and are better than what is suggested in the new clause. Subsection (4) suggests that the Secretary of State should reimburse institutions for certifying or certificating students. They now certify or certificate—the latter is a better word—students for the community charge. Fewer students will have to be certificated under the council tax proposals, because those in student halls of residence do not need to be certificated. Only those who are living in the community would need to be certificated, so the administrative task that will fall upon councils will clearly be less than it is today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, prior to the change from rates to the community charge, Nottingham university had a total rates bill of £1.6 million. That became a business rate during the community charge period. If halls of residence are now to be totally exempt, will the universities pay a substantially smaller business rate contribution through the national pool, or is there another mechanism that we should have explained to us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are talking about the generality of the rates bill for a university, I suspect that the student halls of residence were typically a small part of that. Many other buildings on a university campus could still be rated. But if my hon. Friend is saying that because we have exempted some of the buildings, universities will have lower rates bills than before, that seems logical. Does it make much difference to the university at the end of the day? I am not so sure about that. When they paid rates on the student halls of residence they were, I presume, in the habit of passing that cost on to the students through their rents. Whether it makes any difference to their cash flow I am not sure, but it seems likely that their rates bills will be reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister prepared to reconsider more helpful transitional arrangements for the phasing out of one student nurse scheme and the phasing in of another? We do not want to rehearse the arguments with the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) because we know where he stands—he is stony-faced at the best of times. Is he prepared to say whether this is the end of the road, or is he prepared to reconsider the matter with us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During his speech, the hon. Gentleman offended my sense of justice very considerably when he revealed that the student nurses to whom he referred had incomes that placed them quite a long way above—I am relying on his calculations—not only the level of income support but the level at which any rebate entitlement would run out. I realised that he was suggesting that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
student nurses, because they were so described, should be given benefits to which other people on equivalent or lower incomes would not be entitled simply because they were not described as student nurses. My sense of justice was deeply outraged and offended by what he said.<br><br>
I could not imagine proposing to the Committee or to the House of Commons a system under which, simply because someone had acquired the label "student nurse", that person was to be treated discriminatingly and quite differently from someone on an equivalent or lower income. I was shocked when the hon. Gentleman proposed that. In my closing remarks I did not want to embarrass him by returning to the injustice of his proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister is being so glib. I genuinely attempted to put forward a proposal. The income level concerned is almost precisely the same as that of the student on Project 2000 who is to be exempt, so the Government cannot use that argument. They have already sold the pass on income levels, which are not an issue with respect to student nurses. The issue is equality of access to a benefit that the Government have decided should go to one set of students rather than to another.<br><br>
I see no party political advantage in this argument, nor have I attempted to gain one. It is unbecoming of the Minister, at this late stage in the day, to try to gain one by this personal attack. All I asked was whether he was prepared to reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not mean to offend the hon. Gentleman, but I think that he is only offended by having been presented with a piece of logic. All through the Committee Labour Members have urged us to give discounts on the basis not of status but income, but when we say that student nurses should not be given a discount if their income does not justify it, they become outraged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But—I think I foresee what the hon. Gentleman is about to say—we believe that certain people should have discounts on the basis of status—namely, students. Students are clearly defined in the regulations that we shall publish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend bear in mind that student pilots are often extremely well paid?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave this point, does the Minister recognise that the Royal College of Nursing says that there is great bitterness among its members who consider that they are being treated illogically and that that treatment results in inequality between nurses? I hope that the Minister has not sat down—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have sat down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall keep going, because I hope to get the Minister back on his feet before we rise tonight. There is great bitterness among RCN members. When I visit my local hospital, Whipps Cross—an excellent hospital in Leytonstone, run by excellent people —the nurses often raise the matter and say that if they are still students and employees of the NHS, they are not exempt from the poll tax, yet Project 2000 nurses are. That will continue under the council tax and it is unfair. I put it to the Minister that apprentices are employed but are granted an exemption. They are in schedule 1—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are mentioned in schedule 1, but schedule 1 deals with discounts, not exemptions.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. Nevertheless, an allowance is made for apprentices who are employees. Student nurses who are not on Project 2000 do not get an exemption because they are regarded as employees, but their income may be no greater than that of Project 2000 nurses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman plays into my hands. Paragraph 4 of schedule 1 puts student nurses, apprentices and youth trainees on the same footing. They are all eligible for discounts, but those categories are not exempt, except for student nurses on Project 2000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, but it still leaves an enormous inequality between a Project 2000 nurse, who is totally exempt, and an ordinary nurse who is employed by the NHS but is a student and unfortunately cannot get on to a Project 2000 course. It is not her fault; the number of places on that course is limited, as the scheme is being phased in. It is unfair that such inequality should exist. That point has been made to me several times by local nurses. The Royal College of Nursing has made it clear that there is great bitterness about it. I echo the appeal made by my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) to the Minister. Will he reconsider the matter and try to establish equality between two nurses who work together but are treated differently? That is unfair. I seek an assurance from the Minister.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister on a point that he made, which I am sure was a slip of the tongue. He tried to justify his position and to criticise my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) by pointing out what we all accept—that income is not relevant to discounts. After a moment's reflection, the Minister will realise that we are talking not about discounts but exemptions. Clearly, income can be relevant to exemptions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield would defend himself against the charge of illogicality by saying that the Opposition did not raise the question of access to benefits as a bar to exempting all student nurses in the way in which student nurses on Project 2000 are exempt. Will the Minister reconsider what he said and, at least, apologise to my hon. Friend for misrepresenting him? The Government introduced the question of income and resources as a bar to exemption. Is not that so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not a bar. We believe that certain categories of people may need help; students are exempt because they have no income beyond their bursaries, and people on low incomes can qualify for social security benefits and so can be compensated. That is appropriate, as we have said several times.</span></p>
