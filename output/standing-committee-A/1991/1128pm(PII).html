	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 222, in page 16, line 44, leave out "24 hours" and insert "7 days".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 252, in page 16, line 45, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) A local assessor when exercising his power under subsection (2) above shall provide the occupier with the option of a visit out of normal working hours if the occupier so wishes.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 253, in clause 89, page 59, line 35, leave out "24 hours" and insert "7 days".</p>
	<p>No. 254, in clause 89, page 59, line 36, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) A local assessor when exercising his power under subsection (2) above shall provide the occupier with the option of a visit out of normal working hours if the occupier so wishes.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced—it has been put to me by the assessors in Scotland—that a statutory obligation to give 24 hours' notice or any other notice should not appear in the Bill. A surveyor should be able to turn up at the door, ring the doorbell and, if the householder is happy, to do the job without having to give notice. If there has to be notice, however, it should be seven days, not 24 hours. Two people in employment and out at work when the notice arrives through the post—it will arrive at 9 o'clock in the morning—will not find out about it until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening when they come home. That is not 24 hours' notice; it is no more than about 12 hours. It is not long enough; they are not able to take time off work to ensure that someone is present when the surveyor arrives. We suggest a more reasonable timescale. The amendment cannot be considered a political obstruction. It is not a matter of principle. It deals with the realities of life. I hope that the Minister might have regard for that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the valuer or surveyor should not produce his authority "if required"; the Bill should simply provide for that person to produce his authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put my name to the amendment, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti), and I tabled a similar amendment for Scotland. I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
this day and age, giving 24 hours' notice by post that their property is to be inspected is unrealistic. It shows that parliamentary draftsmen are living in the age of the non-working spouse or, indeed, of domestic servants. As the hon. Member for Cathcart pointed out, many households are not like that any more and 24 hours' notice does not give enough time for people to arrange time off work or to move their appointments, or even arrange for a neighbour to look after the house. On the islands in my constituency, one certainly could not guarantee that the post would be delivered within 24 hours. Far from it; some islands do not have the facilities and the boat calls on only three days a week. We live in the days of the citizens charter but the clause gives a power to state officials that is almost arrogant. The amendment reminds the Government as well as the councils that they are there to serve the people, not the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 252, 253 and 254 would give the option of inspections outside the working hours. Why should someone lose a day's pay to help the workings of the tax? Again, I remind the Committee of the citizens charter, which is supposed to ensure that services are provided in a manner and at times convenient to the customer or the client, whatever term the Government use. It may be more expensive because of the overtime payments required when a valuation is made outside working hours, but that is another price that must be paid for a property tax. If the Government believe in service to the people, it is essential that they allow valuations to be made when it is convenient for the householder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government will accept that this is a valuable amendment. If someone is at home when the valuer calls, he is likely to object no more than he would if the meter reader was on the doorstep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members have said, 24 hours' notice is no use for people who are out at work. Someone could arrive to carry out the work before the householder was even aware that they were required to be there. People cannot just disappear from their jobs. Many people cannot phone in and say that they are going to take the rest of the day off, because if they did so they would lose a day's pay. If seven days' notice were required, people would stand more chance of making a flexible arrangement with a colleague to take over their responsibilities for one day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the valuer could state whether he would call in the morning or the afternoon, to save the frustration of a person waiting in all day for the valuer who arrives at half-past five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing party political in the amendment. If the Government really want to show that they are serious about meeting the needs of working women, they will reconsider the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendment and hope that the Minister will reconsider the clause, which confers a strong power—the power of entry. That has serious implications for civil liberties. Before a power of entry is given, it is necessary carefully to protect people's rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At least 24 hours' notice",</p></blockquote>
but that is not good enough. Some officious authorities will give only 24 hours' notice, and that is appalling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inappropriate in this day and age, when both members of the household may be working or have commitments to fulfil—taking the children to school or looking after elderly parents, for example. There is no time to make alternative arrangements if only 24 hours' notice is given. It is worse—the 24 hours' notice is by post. The post can take 24 hours to arrive at its destination—two or three days if it is second-class post. This is not a satisfactory arrangement, and it is tied up with the penalties in subsection (4) which says that there could be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a fine not exceeding level 2".</p></blockquote>
Level 2 is a penalty of up to £100. That is set to increase under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to £500. It is therefore not right for such short notice to be given. I ask the Minister to reconsider these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also reconsider subsection (3), which provides that the person from the valuation office must "produce his authority"? That is reasonable, but his authority could be just a card and a photograph. There is a serious problem in some areas where someone simply rolls along, produces a card, claims to be an official and demands to be let in. He then robs the house or intimidates the resident in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger, if the clause is passed as it stands, that a person will turn up with his card and photograph, claim to be from the valuation office and demand to be admitted to value the house under section 26 of the Local Government Finance Act. People will be intimidated and it will aid those who want to carry out robberies. I hope that the Minister will tighten the clause so that the authority is more powerful and will deter those who might try to use it to commit a robbery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see the point of providing for penalties and fining people £500. What could be done if a valuation officer was prevented from entering a property? We obviously need a longer notice period to give the resident a chance to let the valuation officer in, but if he consistently refuses to let him in the valuation officer could threaten to set the valuation in a higher band. That in itself would encourage the resident to admit the valuation officer. I cannot therefore see the benefit of tough penalties in these circumstances. All that makes a strong case for the Minister to take the clause back and to tighten it to protect our civil liberties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been conducted rather as though we were talking about rates or fair rates, were that not a contradiction in terms. The debate has been conducted rather as though we imagined that there would have to be many visits to individual properties to value them. One of the great advantages of the banding system is that visits to individual properties will be rare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I venture the opinion that they will be rare. They would certainly be much less frequent than they would be under rating legislation. Bearing in mind, I am glad that no hon. Member made the point that I thought that they might make—that this gives a power to estate agents to enter people's property. Fortunately they were all able to read clearly in the clause that the power is given only to servants of the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been an interesting debate and some interesting points have been made. I would like to reflect upon the 24-hour provision to see what I think of it. I am aware—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. When the Minister considers the matter, will he do so for more than 24 hours before he decides whether the period should be 24 hours or less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an intervention rather than a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Sir Michael.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have until consideration on Report to think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of precedent. I have great respect for Scottish legislation on the matter. The power is precedented in Scottish legislation as far back as 1928. In England and Wales we did not catch up with it until 1967. We have used 24 hours for some time: we certainly used 24 hours in non-domestic rating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Is it in order for the Minister to make speeches about points that we should have made but did not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ministers are entitled to make speeches in their own way, provided that they are in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your protection, Sir Michael. I thought that the Committee might produce examples of real people who had been inconvenienced by real inspections and the pursuit of this power, but we heard none, although there was much speculation on how difficult it might be if 24 hours is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between legislation and practice is that, in performing its duties, the valuation office will act sensitively—for example, by making arrangements by telephone and agreeing a suitable date. We are discussing the legislative position, not the practical position. It may be argued that if, in practice, arrangements were made on that sensible basis, why should it not be reflected in the Bill. It is on that that I wish to reflect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want also to discuss with the valuation office what is its normal practice about making arrangements with people who are at work during the day. I am sure that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) would not wish to saddle the valuation office with the hopeless task of trying to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
see people at improbable times and paying officers vast sums of overtime to visit houses, but I wish to discuss with valuation officers what their normal practice is in such circumstances. Perhaps I can provide the Committee with some comments on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reflect further on whether the period should be 24 hours or some other suitable time, I do not necessarily think that it should be seven days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reply: at least it is a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people do not believe that there should be a statutory obligation on an officer to inform the occupier of his visit. If no one is there, the notice should be seven days, but a seven-day or 24-hour notice should not be necessary for every visit. If an assessor is in an area and asks whether he can do the valuation there and then without giving any written notice, that would make sense, but would it be permitted? Will the Minister think about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between practice and statute. In practice, the valuation officer knocks on doors, telephones the owner, or makes all sorts of informal arrangements. The provision represents the bottom line. If there has been difficulty or resistance when the valuer wishes to enter the property, the provision can be invoked. It is a formal position before a serious power of entry can be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) is not in the Scottish clause. Perhaps, later this evening, the Scottish Office Minister will explain why.

	<div class='title'>INFORMATION ABOUT LISTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 213, in page 18, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) A requirement under subsection (1), (2) or (3) above shall not include the giving of access to any information if—
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) it was not obtained by the listing office or the billing authority for the purpose of carrying out their functions under this Part of this Act; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) it is personal information.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4B) For the purposes of subsection (4A) above personal information is information which relates to an individual (living or dead) who can be identified from that information or from that or other information supplied to any person by the listing officer or billing authority; and personal information includes any expression of opinion about the individual and indication of the intentions of any person in respect of the individual.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 48, in page 18, line 42, at end insert—
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) Access to the information under subsection (5) above may be refused if the access in question—
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) is to information that relates to another living individual who has not consented to the access in question, and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) is not for a purpose associated with the Council Tax, and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) if the billing authority has passed a resolution to the effect that the privacy of individuals in the area served by the authority needs to be protected.".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are again in danger of great difficulty because of the guillotine and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) would like to spend time discussing some of the remaining Scottish amendments. I shall be brief and I hope that the debate will be conducted quickly. We are considering the duty, under clause 28, of the listing office and billing authority to provide certain information to the public on the list that is to be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I mention a general concern on which I am certain mat the Minister will be able to give the assurance that we want. Under this scheme and others, local authorities will have a great deal of information about people, such as details of their incomes—obtained when they apply for benefit—and details of arrears of poll tax and any other debts that they owe a council. I ask the Minister for an absolute assurance that none of that information will become available by virtue of the clause. We merely want to know what further instructions, if any, the Government may deem are required. I fully understand that the Data Protection Act 1988 should cover that point, but some local authorities have got into difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, information will be obtained for the purposes of the scheme. I seek a similar assurance that no information about the names of liable persons, other occupiers, those entitled to discount, benefit status, people's position in the hierarchy of liability and other such personal details will appear on the list or be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, clause 23 provides that a list must show, for each dwelling, which valuation band is applicable and
	<br><blockquote><p>"such information … as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
I am a little alarmed about what that might mean. I have no problems with regard to the first two matters which I mentioned, because we know what happened in the past with rating legislation, but I am concerned about the third possibility. Is there a possibility that information about why a building is exempt will be provided? As exemption might depend on status, the Minister will see where my argument is taking me. Under the provisions relating to exempt properties, there is reference to exemptions being determined by people in particular categories, again, "as may be prescribed". It would be extremely valuable if the Minister could reassure us on the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief but I wish to talk about my linked amendment No. 48, which is a probing amendment designed to obtain information from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 would restrict access to information under subsection (5). Clause 23(3) refers to information relating to dwellings, and I am not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
sure whether that includes information about owners. I believe that personal information on lists should not be disclosed, according to the three conditions in my amendment: if the access
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) is to information that relates to another living individual who has not consented to the access in question, and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) is not for a purpose associated with the Council Tax"—</p></blockquote>
the information should be used for the purposes for which it was intended—that is what the Data Protection Act 1988 is all about—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) if the billing authority has passed a resolution to the effect that the privacy of individuals in the area served by the authority needs to be protected."</p></blockquote>
Those provisos are important. Such information should not be disclosed for junk mail or similar purposes without the consent of the individual involved. Amendment No. 48 is a probing amendment to which the Minister should respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have corresponded with the Data Protection Registrar for some months on the matter. My officials have met the assistant registrar to discuss the points raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham, and those exchanges will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective of the amendments is admirable, but I hope that I can convince the hon. Gentlemen that they are unnecessary. The valuation list will contain no information about individuals. The information for each dwelling will include the address, valuation band and a reference number. The names of the owner or occupier will not appear other than in wholly exceptional circumstances, which the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) will recognise, where the occupier's name forms part of the postal address. The list will show the code number, the effective date if, for example, there has been an alteration to the list, and whether a dwelling is a composite property. The address and band would appear automatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point that it would be possible to put that list together with other lists. Copies of the lists must be available to the public—members of the public should be able to take copies of entries that may be important to them, for instance, in connection with an appeal against banding. However, it is not our policy that whole valuation lists should be sold to companies that compile data bases of personal information. We shall give further consideration to how to achieve that object. I hope that I have reassured hon. Gentlemen of our intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsections (5) and (6) are a relic from the original proposal put forward by the Scottish Office and should not continue to be part of the legislation. When the Government decided to abolish the poll tax and to introduce the council tax, the Scottish Office's original proposal was that the valuation in Scotland would ignore the assessors who are employed already in local authorities in Scotland. The valuation in Scotland would be handled in exactly the same way as it would be in England and Wales and so be carried out by Commissioners of Inland Revenue who would employ private surveyors and estate agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pointed out to the Under-Secretary that that was a mistake and that it was absurd to ignore the great expertise of assessors in Scotland who also had the staff in place to do the job. After the Scottish Office received representations and the Under-Secretary and his advisers met the assessors, the Government changed their mind, but they did not go all the way. They decided that the assessors would do the work—even though they are employed, independently, by local authorities—but that they would still be under the control of Commissioners of Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the purpose of that. Assessors in Scotland have, in the past, carried out valuations without any bother and have kept a balance. The Under-Secretary argues that that would ensure uniformity between the various local authorities in Scotland and perhaps between England and Wales. That is not necessary. The bands are different in Scotland, so there is no necessity for uniformity between the countries. Assessors have created uniformity across Scotland in the past without having to be controlled by the Inland Revenue. Therefore, I suggest that the Under-Secretary accepts our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) suggested that the purpose of subsection (5) was to ensure uniformity throughout the United Kingdom. That is unnecessary. Moreover, it could possibly cause confusion because of the three different banding system in England, Scotland and Wales. I cannot see the purpose in this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in our proceedings, the Under-Secretary said that he welcomed the diversity that sometimes occurred in the ways in which different parts of the United Kingdom do things and said that he was not out to ensure exact uniformity. We shall reject the change unless a very cogent reason for it is produced. Subsection (6) raises fears that it is a step on the way to bringing the assessors under the control of the Inland Revenue. I can see no reason for that. The assessors have always been highly regarded in Scotland for their excellent work. They have acted independently of the Inland Revenue for many years and have done an outstanding job. We must not forget that they kept valuations going in Scotland when they had been abandoned in England for a long time. I look forward to hearing the Under-Secretary's reasons for the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.45 pm</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made a wry smile when the hon. Member for Cathcart said that there had been valuations in Scotland in the past without any bother at all. Valuation practices north and south of the border have differed, in relation both to domestic and to industrial valuations. I do not criticise the assessors, who are very professional, but the differences between valuation systems have led to problem after problem with such things as sports grounds, petrochemical complexes and shooting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) that the purpose of subsection (6) is simply to allow the Inland Revenue commissioners to incur expenditure in Scotland as they perform their duties in setting up the council tax. The amount of money involved is small, amounting to about £100,000 over three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart was incorrect to say that the Government had ever ruled out the use of assessors. I recall that I gave a television interview on the evening after the Secretary of State's statement—I cannot remember whether the hon. Gentleman was also on the programme—and responded to a question on that point by making it clear that the use of the assessor's expertise had not been ruled out in Scotland. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has accepted that the Government listened to the representations received by the Scottish Office. The Scottish Office is very much part of the listening Government, and we took full heed of all reasonable and constructive representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always possible that different professionals will reach different conclusions for technical reasons. It is not true that the treatment given by assessors in Scotland has always been consistent. We have been told about different professionals taking a different view in different parts of Scotland. The council tax is a Great Britain tax, not a United Kingdom tax. It is right to aim for consistency of practice in the valuation process. The assessors have accepted that the fall-back role of the commissioners of Inland Revenue is not unreasonable. I do not suggest that they approve of it, but they understand its value in the light of the need for consistency throughout Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those assurances will persuade the hon. Member for Cathcart to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary may intend the level of spending by the Inland Revenue in Scotland provided for in subsection (6) to be low, but the subsection implies that there are much wider powers than he outlined. The hon. Gentleman referred to problems in the past because of different practices in valuation. I wonder whether he is referring to industrial properties. In one country an industrial property may be banded according to the profitability of the firm, and in another country according to square footage. That could produce strange results. A business that occupied a very small floor area may be highly profitable, but a huge business, such as a shipyard, may be losing money. Clearly valuation factors would produce variations between the two countries.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
If this proposal is about bringing valuation factors across the whole of Great Britain into conformity, the Minister owes it to the Committee to spell that out. We would not have known that if we had not pressed him on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained this matter publicly on several occasions. I can reassure the hon. Lady about the powers that subsection (6) give to the commissioners of the Inland Revenue. Those powers are limited by reference to subsection (5). Expenditure can be incurred only by giving directions to the assessors; the commissioners will not have a general power to incur extra expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that valuations can differ if the legislation differs. She clearly referred to the situation in which there are different legislative provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. There have been problems because of not only legislative differences but differences of interpretation. That is accepted by the assessors and the district valuers in other areas. Indeed, working parties are trying to iron out these problems. The purpose of the powers of direction for the commissioners of the Inland Revenue is to ensure that such problems do not recur with the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 230, in page 57, line 5, leave out subsections (7), (8) and (9).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three subsections refer to the possible use of the private sector by the assessors to carry out some of the valuations in Scotland. I do not think that they are necessary. We could say, "We know the assessors in Scotland. They won't use them anyway, so it doesn't make any difference."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, let me read briefly from the document issued to local authorities in Scotland on the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991 and how it should be implemented. It considers the authorities' estimates of the cost of carrying out the valuations. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In considering whether or not an authority's estimate is reasonable, the Secretary of State will expect to be provided with
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
evidence that the contribution which the private sector may make to the valuation exercise has been explored."</p></blockquote>
That comes close to being a threat by the Secretary of State to local authorities that they must use the private sector and, if they do not, the Government will consider that they could have done it cheaper, and should have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That document shows that the Government expect the assessors who undertake most of the valuations required to implement the property tax to give some of the work to estate agents and private surveyors even though, unlike the assessors, they have no experience of valuing for tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally, the Government were going to give the whole job to the estate agents—who tend to be their friends—and to those who own and run estate agency businesses. They were forced to admit—I concede that they gave way—that that would have been an act of supreme folly given that the enormous expertise of the assessors department was available. The Government are now determined that the private sector should receive some of the gravy, if not the meat. That is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our discussions, we have noted two conflicting pressures on assessors. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue claim that so much information is sought that the valuation officer cannot cope and the Scottish Office claims that the private sector should be used. However, the work can be effectively completed without the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assessors have proved their ability to carry out wider, more sophisticated valuations than those required by the Bill. They do not need the help of estate agents who know little or nothing about valuations, especially for public housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate emphasises that the Government never have the humility to admit that they are wrong. They hang on to a vestige of their thick-headed pride and insist on retaining part of their original proposal instead of scrapping it completely. For once, I hope that the Government will consider the good of the Scottish people and forget their ideological fixations and their constant need to put money in the pockets of their friends and backers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee welcomed the opportunity to listen to the hon. Member for Cathcart reading out his press release. The hon. Gentleman did not refer to amendment No. 231, which is designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Hon. Members all agree about that principle. The Government will propose regulations under clause 82 to effect it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the general point made by the hon. Member for Cathcart was absolute nonsense. The Government have never ruled out the use of assessors. We were not forced to make a U-turn. We responded quickly and constructively to the reasonable representations that were made to us. That should have elicited praise from the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart referred to a circular. It is reasonable for the Secretary of State to ensure that the assessors are satisfied, and have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
satisfied him, that they did not need to use the private sector. I believe that the assessors might use the private sector, especially to improve the quality of information about properties that are near the band limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart put forward some theory about ideology that does not conform to the facts. He knows that, even if those who receive his press release do not. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment in the light of reassurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight chance that I might withdraw the amendment, but I shall not withdraw my press release. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument. Assessors have not needed to use private agents in the past. The new valuation is less sophisticated and less complicated than those that they have carried out in the past. There is no point in forcing them to consider giving work to the private sector.

	<br><blockquote><p>"and having considered the incidence of council tax on the residents in its area".</p></blockquote>
When I taught, the last lecture on a Friday afternoon was always the most difficult and this is a somewhat comparable situation. The amendment would require billing authorities, before setting their council tax, to have regard to the incidence of the tax at that level
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
on the residents in its area. Its purpose is to ensure that the socio-economic consequences of the council tax are neither forgotten nor submerged beneath the weight of financial pressures placed upon local authorities by the Government. For the purposes of the Committee, it is also to probe the Government on the extent to which it has assessed the number of gainers and losers in the council tax, their status and means, and the extent of any gains and losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members who served on the Committee that considered the poll tax Bill, which went on for three months, not three weeks, will recall, as you will, Sir Michael, as you chaired many of our meetings, that we studied the number of gainers and losers from the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make every local authority—every billing authority—consider how the council tax within the banding arrangements will affect the people in its areas. There is no doubt that the tax will have different effects in different local authorities. The council will have no discretion in determining how the tax affects its inhabitants, but it can find out what the banding arrangements will mean when the council tax is set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated the question of the bands and their proportionality. There was only a 3:1 ratio between those at the top and the bottom of the bands. We considered that the poorest would be losers and the richest would be gainers. It is important to ensure that before a council sets the final figure of the tax, having taken away precepts, grant and the non-domestic rate, it should consider what will happen to the people in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a fundamental difference in philosophy between Conservative Members and ourselves about the nature of the bands. We consider that differences within the bands will mean that it still is not a fair tax. The old problems of the poll tax where the rich gained and the poor lost, will remain. Therefore, it is incumbent on the local authority carefully to consider the effect that the council tax will have on local people before setting a figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the run-up to the introduction of the poll tax in 1990, many local authorities calculated the number of household and individuals who would be gainers or losers. The majority of each lost, particularly those in middle and lower income ranges. The failure of the poll tax was that it was not related to the ability to pay it. If the council tax is to have any meaning, local authorities must ensure that it reflects people's ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comparable analyses have yet to be undertaken by local authorities. That may take some time because of the absence of reliable information on capital values, household sizes and individual status. However, this week, the Institute of Fiscal Studies produced a study that considered the effects of the council tax within the eight bands set by the Government. The study compares the numbers who will gain or lose in the switch from the poll tax. It also gives the number of gainers and losers if the Government were to alter their proposals and have more bands, which would make liability more closely proportional to bandings on actual values rather than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
banded capital values. The report is called "The Proposed Council Tax".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not been sent to us. I have not seen a copy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make sure that the Minister gets a copy as soon as convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report stated that the council tax is a hybrid tax. It is neither a poll tax, the rates, a property tax or an income tax; in many respects, in its effects on the inhabitants of an area, it is all of those things. The report concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is partly a poll tax, as the first and second liable adults each contribute to the bill. It is partly a property tax, as property values also affect bills. But unlike a pure property tax, bills will not rise in proportion to values. The different elements interact. For instance, the size of the 'poll tax' element depends on the property value, so one cannot put precise values on the contributions of each part, but it would be hard to argue that the tax was more than half 'property tax'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In addition, once properties are in the bottom and top bands, property values have no further effect on tax payable. In some areas most properties fall into just two or three bands. For instance, the DoE (1991b) estimates 65 per cent of properties in South Buckinghamshire and Barnet to be in Bands F and G, and 63 per cent of Manchester properties to be in Band A. In such areas, the 'property tax' element will be largely invisible in terms of local variation and the tax will look more like a hybrid of a household tax and a poll tax."</p></blockquote>
The Government have made a choice between two principles, that of protecting those on the lowest incomes and that of giving accountability to local voters affected by local spending. The latter will not be breached, not only for those who receive full rebates, but for all those—perhaps 13 per cent of households—receiving rebates. In such cases the new tax will be more like an income tax than anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the report states that the council tax will be quite a mixture. It will be part household tax, part poll tax, part property tax and part income tax; and that it would be wrong to see the tax wholly or, indeed, mostly, as a property tax. The report's findings are quite dramatic. The Institute of Fiscal Studies found that under the Government's proposals, 27 per cent of families will gain and 37 per cent will lose. If the number of bands were extended—our suggestion last week, which the Government foolishly decided against—there would be as many losers as gainers but the tax burden would be shifted towards those on the highest bands. In other words, it would be shifted towards those who were able to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report's third conclusion about making liability more proportional to bandings would leave 43 per cent of families better off, but only 32 per cent worse off. If capital values were used, the basis of liability would leave 41 per cent better off and 33 per cent worse off, those at the bottom gaining most. The results of that study make it clear that the council tax will not fully reverse the shift in the tax burden brought about by the poll tax. The Government's refusal to make liability proportionate to bandings or to use actual capital values as the basis of liability will ensure that gains made by the best-off in 1990 are retained as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
That is a damning indictment of the Government. An independent professional organisation comprising economists and accountants has concluded that the council tax will, in many respects, be no better than the poll tax with regard to people's ability to pay. The Government rejected the poll tax, first, because it was not collectable and, secondly, because it was perceived by the majority of people not to be fair. The study rightly maintains that the council tax will be almost as unfair as the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment, when deciding their budget local authorities would consider the effect of the tax on individuals in their areas. They have no discretion to alter the tax but they can examine how the tax will affect different people within the different bands. If they conclude that the tax is very unfair, they can either reduce the tax and, as a consequence, cut local services or they can increase local services to help those who would be disadvantaged by the implementation of the tax. I have raised an important principle, and I hope that the Minister understands that the relationship between the tax bands and poverty is very real. If the Government are serious about abandoning the poll tax as a result of its lack of relationship with the ability to pay, I trust that they will seriously consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government cannot resist boasting. Their press release of 6 November states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under our council tax proposals some district councils, because of prudent housekeeping, are likely to receive more redistributed non-domestic rates … and Revenue Support Grant … than they wish to spend. We do not propose to claw back NDR or RSG in such circumstances.

As for the councils being prudent, they will be encouraged by the Government to cut their services to the bone. They will be rewarded for cutting their needs assessment. Often, local authorities break the

law by not providing the services that they should. There should be proper minimum standards to protect local people in those, mainly Tory, areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. It is central to his argument that more money should be spent. Is he saying that the amount of money for local authorities would be increased were there to be a Labour Government next year, or would central support remain the same?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman realises that there will be a Labour Government next year. I thoroughly agree with him. However, such decisions will rest with the next Labour Government's Front Bench, and I have not been chosen to be on the Front Bench. It shows the depth of talent that there is in the parliamentary Labour party when I am stuck on the Back Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am almost certain that a Labour Government will increase the provision of public money to local authorities because the authorities provide essential public services. We want to see an improvement in those services, not the public squalor over which the Tory party has been presiding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very modest because I understood that he had been elected to lead his party on defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If more money were allocated to local authorities from central Government, would it be used in the ways for which it was intended? I remind the hon. Gentleman that in the London borough of Lambeth the council is not spending on education the amount that the Government have allocated for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making my case for minimum standards. Instead of the Government rewarding the Tory shire councils which do not provide those minimum standards, they should insist on such a provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us return to this important amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Sir Michael. The amendment is about having a negative council tax. The mere fact that some authorities could have a negative tax demonstrates the standard spending assessments fiddle. It is scandalous that people in boroughs such as Wandsworth pay nothing while those in neighbouring boroughs pay a tax for services. Everyone knows that services cannot be provided for nothing. That relates to gearing. I said on Second Reading that when some authorities spend 1 per cent over their budget they are penalised and have to put 10 per cent on their council tax bills. We see the opposite in place here: the gearing works the other way when shire counties spend less than their needs assessment. That is the only reason that they can have a negative council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trespass upon your Thursday evening spirit, Sir Michael, because I know that the next
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
amendment explores this issue more fully. However, as I am doing my preparation, I have a list of 30 authorities—not all of which are Conservative-controlled or in shire counties; the list includes Labour councils—which would have negative council tax rates based on illustrative 1991–92 figures. Is the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) saying that his only interest is in taxing people, not in rewarding good government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If the Minister introduced an amendment that gave all councils a negative tax, I would support that immediately. He can start with my local authority of Waltham Forest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asked what would be done with the surplus money that the Department of the Environment's press release stated will be available when councils' non-domestic rates and revenue support grant are above their expenditure. Amendment No. 237 would ensure that the negative amount was paid to people. Conservative Members fail to understand that under the proposals councils may be paid more money than they need to spend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a good point, which shows the inequity of the system. The proposals will reward local authorities which cut their services to the bone. Almost £2 billion of business rates from London will be distributed away while London's council tax payers receive high bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said earlier that everybody knew that services cannot be provided for nothing. May I say how pleased Conservative Members are that the Labour party has finally admitted that. I had thought that Labour party policy stated that services could be made available for nothing. I welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Conservative side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we are the realists and the Conservatives are fiddlers. We have examples of them fiddling the poll tax for Wandsworth and Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman had a point when he referred to gearing. However, his complaints should have been directed at the past incompetence of Lambeth Labour councillors. He also referred to levels of support and the reasons for different rates of community charge and council tax. Lambeth receives £1,500 per head from the Government compared with Wandsworth's £1,000 per head, yet it provides lower quality services. After the needs assessment and standard spending assessment have been made, it is up to a local authority to make efficiency savings that enable its services to be provided at a cost that local people can afford. That happens in Wandsworth, where, after the budget this year, the poll tax was reduced from £136 to zero. Wandsworth will be efficient again next year. I shall not delay the Committee tonight, because the hon. Gentleman can read the motion about Conservative success in Wandsworth in tomorrow's order paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes his point rationally, but it is a cheap political point. We all know that Lambeth's problems are deep-seated. If the Government had chosen to they could have helped the councillors to solve the problems, but they deliberately did not do so because they wanted Lambeth to be a political scapegoat. For all the hon. Gentleman's rationality, his argument amounts only to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a most enjoyable debate. Where are the London authorities with the highest per capita external finance? They are in Lambeth, Islington and Hackney; they are not in Wandsworth and Westminster. Those Labour-controlled authorities receive more public money per head than any other authorities in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) must try to guide himself back to the amendment. I know that the third act of a long day must end in a climax, but perhaps the climax could relate to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall definitely have further opportunities to exchange statistics. I shall come to the climax of my speech. I would support a negative council tax and a negative income tax, although that is not party policy. I support putting money into the pockets of the poor in some way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have studied the Bill and it contains no reference to a negative council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 237 would allow the setting of a negative council tax. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are going to have a negative income tax, I want it for my borough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the aid of the hon. Gentleman. There is an easy way to get a negative council tax for his borough, and that is to vote Conservative and elect a Tory council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would get negative services then, and that would be a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the Government will not give the money to the council tax payers in those circumstances. Whatever surplus has been built up will stay in the coffers of the service-cutting local authorities. They will invest and earn interest on money that belongs, if it belongs to anybody, to their council tax payers. The Government have no worries about the complexity of the Bill in other respects but they say it is too complex to pay council tax payers in those circumstances. They should not boast in their press release because they have nothing to boast about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A council tax payer might not live to enjoy the refund that he might otherwise have had. I am sorry
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
to be morbid at this time of night, but why should that money—his money—be stored up? The Government should hand it over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend had time to reflect that while he is working so hard to raise the level of debate, the Liberal Democrats are again missing from the Committee for the second time after dinner, despite their press releases saying that they would be here to fight tooth and nail. I hope that they are not celebrating the birthday of the wife of my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) while he is here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will reduce standard spending assessments to a notional guesstimate. The standard spending assessments are already discredited; the proposals will make them a mockery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the SSAs are discredited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best that we can say about the Liberal Democrats is that they are a negative vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I check that an important principle has got through to the hon. Gentleman? He referred to the concept of the ownership of money and said that it was a bad thing for a council to hold on to money taken from tax payers. Does that principle extend to his own political beliefs, and does he now understand that the Government spend tax payers' money and should therefore spend as little as possible, not as much as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that logic. The hon. Gentleman claims that Conservative logic dictates that money held by the state or a local authority should be handed back to the tax payers. Yet the proposals will allow the shire counties to keep the money in total opposition to his party's professed logic. That is typical of Conservative double standards. I do not object to councils holding on to money if they use it for capital purposes. It is essential for councils to work the system to build up capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have the weekend to think about my point. When he reads the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of what he has said, he will see that he has spoken against the concept behind the London equalisation scheme, against the London discount scheme and against redistribution. Is that now his policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of redistribution and equalisation, but I am not in favour of Government fiddles to tilt SSAs away from urban areas with needs in favour of the leafy suburbs. That is why I support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
