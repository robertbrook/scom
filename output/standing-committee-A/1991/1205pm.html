	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney (Makerfield)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good afternoon, Sir Michael. Before I continue my remarks, I should like to apologise to the Minister of State. In the cut and thrust of the debate, I thought that he was trying to get under my guard and I was not prepared to let him in. Unknown to me, he was genuinely trying to catch my eye in relation to Mr. Leadbitter. I apologise to the Minister of State that he had to speak on a point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was coming to the climax of my remarks. I want to make one final point. In a matter of months, 60 per cent. of all students will be transferred on to Project 2000 courses. A short time after that, the remainder of students will join them. Is the Minister prepared to hold discussions with his colleagues in the Department of Health between now and Report and advise us on Report whether they are prepared to reconsider the matter and perhaps accept some of our amendments? If so, that would be a reasonable approach. I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendments today or accept in public my arguments about Project 2000. But as we know how quickly students will be transferred from one scheme to another, the Minister might be prepared to come a little way down the road towards me and agree to discussions with his colleagues in the Department of Health. With those few remarks
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>958</span>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as we have debated the issue several times in Committee. The amendment gives the Government the opportunity finally to make the break with the poll tax, which they keep saying that they want to do. It gets rid of the 20 per cent. minimum payment for the poll tax a year earlier than the introduction of the council tax. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] That is right. Note it down. Shall I say it another five times so that the Under-Secretary can write it down, or is that cheating?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the Minister of State trying to defend his position this morning. It is difficult to believe that a Government can be so ideologically stupid. By introducing the Bill, the Government have admitted that the poll tax was a disastrous and unfair, chaotic mess and it was foisted on the Scottish people. The 20 per cent. minimum payment rule created most of the problems for local authorities and for thousands of people in Scotland and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Government still refuse to let it go at the earliest opportunity. That is absurd. It has led thousands of people into debt. It has forced local authorities to use the most draconian means to try to collect relatively small sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government insist on continuing it for another 12 months, local authorities will spend enormous amounts for the next five or six years collecting small sums from people who cannot afford to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No Minister, including the Minister of State, has been able to advance a rational argument for the retention of the 20 per cent. rule after 1 April next year. In my view it is nothing but blind bigotry [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Under-Secretary is writing down my words again. He may have been reading 	<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> I am winning and I am so intent on winning that I keep saying that to keep him happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had my way, the Government would go further than abolishing the 20 per cent. minimum payment. Thousands of people in Scotland have been led into greater debt than otherwise by the non-payment campaign of the Scottish National party. People believed the Scottish National party when it claimed that people did not have to pay the tax. Those people did not then claim their rebate on 1 April 1989. A couple can now be left with £2,000 to £2,500 of debt. The Government, if they had any sense, would allow the backdating of rebates to 1 April 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would have been easier to show up the Scottish National party as isolated and irresponsible if it were not for the largish number of Labour Members and councillors who also advocated non-payment? Can there be any doubt about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My party and I have opposed nonpayment. In Scotland we had a conference on it, which overwhelmingly defeated those who wished to run a non-payment campaign and the party has been clear about that. Some people in the Labour party have, wrongly in my view, led non-payment campaigns. However, they stuck to it. Whatever else one might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>959</span>
say about them, they have not walked away from the people whom they led into it. What annoyed me most about members of the Scottish National party was that as soon as the Government announced the council tax, they abandoned their campaign, pulled out their cheque books to pay off their debts and left thousands of people with debts that they could not pay because they do not have cheque books and bank accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government to backdate rebates to 1 April 1989. Local authorities should also have the right restored to them to examine individual cases. Local authorities can then decide whether collecting the debt is viable and see whether the collection of the debt would force the family into an unacceptable level of poverty. If so, they can say that enough is enough and write off the debt. The Government should also refund local government for any write-off of that nature. That is probably asking too much of the Government. That is what I should like to see them do, but the minimum that they should do is abolish the 20 per cent. minimum contribution. That would not cost very much. In Scotland it would cost about £45 million in any one year. That is only 10 per cent. of the sum that the Government were happy to hand out to reduce the poll tax of everyone in Scotland by £140—everyone, that is, except those who were on the minimum payment of 20 per cent. who did not have their bills reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he did not expect it of us, but that he would wish it himself, and that it was only a small sum of money. What is £45 million? A small sum! So that it can go on the score sheet, will the hon. Gentleman give a straightforward assurance that a Labour Government would pledge themselves to making those payments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my opinion, we should use some of the money that the Government have allocated to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will Labour do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Minister commits the Government to holding a general election before 1 April 1992, it will be impossible for a Labour Government to do that. I am sure that the media would be delighted to know whether the general election will be before 1 April 1992. I will commit the Labour party to getting rid, in Scotland, of the 20 per cent. minimum payment on 1 April 1992 if the general election is prior to that date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us get on with the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton.</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> You are right, Sir Michael. The Government are being ideologically stupid. They have an opportunity to retrieve at least a small amount of the ground that they have lost over the poll tax. There may not be many votes in it for them, but they could show a little humility and a little understanding of the enormous damage that they have caused to people with the poll tax by getting rid of it on 1 April 1991. It is not much to ask the Government to give 10 per cent. of the money that they gave to reduce everyone's tax by £140 and to get rid of the requirement in Scotland and so help the poorest people in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>960</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am about to sit down. The Government should make that sort of committment. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Stewart) should reply because most damage has been done in Scotland, where people have had the poll tax longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 276, which is grouped with amendment No. 329 and No. 330, would have the same effect. That amendment stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put three points to the Minister in the hope that he will respond to them. First, will the Minister address the illogicality of asking people to pay the 20 per cent. contribution in the next financial year when the Government accept that, for the following year under the council tax, those people will not be asked to pay a contribution? There is no logic in that whatsoever. Either the Government are or are not about their proposals for the council tax from 1993. Or, perhaps the Government drafted the proposals in the hope that they would not have to look at them in detail before a general election and were planning to change them after the election. That is not now possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a real effort for people to pay the 20 per cent. contribution. The Committee has heard many examples of the hardship that it causes. Will the Minister explain the logic in the Government's proposals, if there is any? Opposition Members fail to understand why, when the Government have conceded that people on income support, students and others on low incomes should not pay the council tax in 1993, those people are being asked to continue to pay the 20 per cent. contribution from April 1992. There is no logic in that. Perhaps the Minister believes that, having inflicted the horrendous poll tax on people, who can ill afford to meet the bill there should be at least, one last year of suffering. If the Government want to inflict that last year of suffering, they should be honest enough to say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to address the real hardship that has been caused. The Minister made great play of the benefits that were available, but he did not deal with cases of people who, as we have shown during the course of the Committee, are in real hardship and do not have the ability to pay. That ability is part of an important principle. In Britain, taxation—until the introduction of the poll tax—had always been based on ability to pay. Many people cannot meet their charges under the poll tax. The citizens advice bureaux have drawn many cases to our attention, and I shall mention a couple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essex has been a popular place from which to cite examples this week because of the publicity about the unpopularity of the Conservative party there. A citizens advice bureau in Essex reported the case of a client who suffered a severe mental breakdown as his income support was reduced to £19.50 because of direct payments. He cannot afford a proper diet if he contributes his 20 per cent. of the community charge. The Minister could end such suffering by accepting such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>961</span>
amendments. I could cite many other examples. I shall give one more so that the Minister can say whether he believes that the Government should inflict another 12 months of suffering on such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A citizens advice bureau in south London reported the case of an owner-occupier aged 60 who is sick with chronic arthritis and diabetes. He receives income support which barely covers the cost of keeping his home. The imposition of the community charge has made it even more difficult for him to survive and he is rapidly sinking into debt. The introduction of the poll tax has led many people who could not pay it to sink into debt—they have had to borrow money to survive. That creates a circle of deprivation. The person in my last example was an owner-occupier. He used his wealth during his lifetime to purchase his home but, because of dwindling income through retirement and ill-health, he is unable to meet his outgoings. That demonstrates that property-based taxes are ludicrous and suggests that an income-based tax is the only alternative. The Minister should accept the reasons why the 20 per cent. should not be collected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and his party should be more convincing about a local income tax being the best alternative. A recent poll in the 	<i>Daily Mail</i> put his party at 6 per cent. in my constituency. I would not mind if that figure were to increase a little. Could the hon. Gentleman be more specific?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My comment will both help and not help the hon. Gentleman. I would not take any notice of the opinion polls. When I was elected to this House an opinion poll two weeks before election day gave me 21 per cent. The hon. Gentleman and others in his constituency have everything to play for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received some excellent passes at Wembley from the hon. Gentleman, so I shall always give way to him in the hope of getting the ball back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost forgot what I was going to say. The hon. Gentleman is encouraging the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman)—the opinion poll showed that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us not have a recital of everyone's favourable standing in the opinion polls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other good reasons why the Minister, even at this late stage, may wish to abolish the 20 per cent. requirement for next year—for example, it is expensive to collect. All the professional associations that have considered the matter have urged the Government to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>962</span>
abolish the 20 per cent. requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some professional associations have already been mentioned, but one that has not is the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation. Despite the fact that I was hoping to be called second in the debate, I believe that I am about the fourth or fifth to speak. It is the first time that the body has been mentioned in the debate on amendment No. 329. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation recently organised an excellent conference in Bournemouth, at which it reiterated its opinion about the 20 per cent. contribution to the poll tax. It said that it cost far more to collect than the actual sum collected. The Audit Commission supports that view, saying that
	<br><q><p>"those with 80 per cent. relief contribute £6 a year net to the Exchequer"—</p></q>
in 1990–91–
	<br><q><p>"and the average cost of collection per chargepayer is £15."</p></q>
[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I am pleased that 	<i>Hansard</i> will record that hon. Members endorse my comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge the Minister to refute the Audit Commission's claim. If it costs two and a half times the amount due to collect the 20 per cent. contributions, surely it would be cost-effective to abolish the 20 per cent. charge, save the cost of collecting it and leave the local authority with a net profit. If the Minister cannot understand that, I wonder what financial advice the Government receive. The argument stands on its merits and is supported by all professional opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given three reasons for abolishing the 20 per cent. contribution—it is illogical, given the Government's policy for the council tax; it causes real hardship to individuals; and it is very expensive and not cost-effective to collect. Those arguments are overwhelming and I hope that the Minister will deal with them as specifically as he can. On previous debates his answers have left much to be desired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first spoke in our first debate, I sought to entertain the Committee by reading a civil service draft about Rufus and the approach of Christmas. I shall now entertain the Committee by reading the civil service draft for the clause. It says, "Mr. Chairman, these amendments seek to extend entitlement to 100 per cent. maximum benefit to all beneficiaries for the last year of the community charge. The Committee has already covered much of the ground in this debate on the last amendment, and I do not therefore propose to rehearse these arguments again." I do not think that I shall be lucky enough to get away quite so lightly, so I shall go a little beyond the civil service draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the first question from the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti), which was whether I could justify the Government's decision to maintain the 20 per cent. contribution in the last year of the community charge, I assure him that I have done that at length, possibly 	<i>ad nauseam</i> and 	<i>ad infinitum.</i> I shall not cover that ground again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A dilemma confronts the Minister as he attempts to reply to the debate. He and some other members of the Committee have indeed mentioned the issue in an earlier debate. Some of us understood the Minister's predicament and refrained from challenging his arguments on that premature occasion. However, it would be unfortunate if he believed that he had fulfilled his duty to the Committee, when he was actually frustrating some hon. Members' opportunity to challenge some of his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obviously in the Committee's hands. I believed that I had covered the arguments. However, I shall run through them again. In 1993, we shall move to a new system that is based on property. Until then, the system of taxation will be based on people. We increased people's social security benefits so that they could contribute to the personal tax; the community charge. The amounts added to social security benefits are more than what's required to cover people's 20 per cent. contributions to the community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money paid into social security benefits has been raised from taxation, which falls not only on the rich and those of middle income but on those of low income. It is important that that basis of taxation continues during the last year of the community charge. Those moneys that were made available for people to make those contributions should be used for that purpose. When we change the system of taxation and base it partly on property, partly on people, the basis of the benefit system will be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a financial question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make progress so that I can answer some of the points that have been made. Far from the assertions made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne and others, that there is a nil-cost option for abolishing the community charge, I assure the Committee that no such option exists. The hon. Member for Eastbourne is misinformed. The cost would be £440 million this year to extend community charge benefits to 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman quoted an Audit Commission document, about which I have refreshed my memory since this morning. Paragraph 15 of the document makes an extraordinary comparison. It compares the amount of money paid by those who receive social security benefits in community charge with what they receive in benefits. That is the net £6 figure. It is a very silly argument of astonishing spuriousness to compare the amount that a person receives with the amount that that person pays out. The only sensible comparison is between how much people are due to pay in community charge and the cost of its collection. The figures that we used are based on the 20 per cent. contribution in England, which is about £50. I outlined the cost of collection this morning. If some enforcement action was taken into account, the average might be £15. Any figure above that would be recoverable from the community charge payer. The tax would, therefore, be worth collecting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could follow through the Audit Commission's argument only by advocating that the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>964</span>
could save money by clawing back the amounts of money that are paid out in benefit. That would mean £440 million to pay 100 per cent. community charge benefit. It would be £580 million if the knock-on effect on other social security benefits was taken into account. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) should know that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) claims that the Labour party is committed to paying 100 per cent. rebate in 1991 in Scotland, but not in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to intervene when the Minister was considering the cost-effectiveness of chasing people who are required to make the 20 per cent. contribution. He suggested that the true calculation was the amount that such people were due to pay less the amount that it cost to make them pay it. That is the wrong calculation. If the Minister is to be allowed to get away with censuring the Audit Commission, he must be rigorous himself and accept that what is at stake is what money can actually be squeezed out of this stone, by comparison with what it costs to try to squeeze it out. What estimate of that can the Minister give us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first year in England local authorities have already collected 95 per cent. of the amount that they estimated they would collect in community charge. I do not know what figure will be raised eventually, but the process goes on and will continue after the end of the first year, the second year and the third year. Local authorities will continue to be obliged to recover the contributions that should have been made in community charge. I am confident that the figure will be high. Much of the cost of seeking to recover those amounts will be recoverable from the community charge payers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland is further down the road and so may be a better example than England and Wales. From the first year of the poll tax, the outstanding debt is still 11.5 per cent. That percentage was given to me last week by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. There is about 20 per cent. outstanding from the second year and at present, 64 per cent. of the poll tax in Scotland for this year is still uncollected. Out of the 3.5 million poll tax payers, there are a million warrants outstanding for the collection of the debt. Even if we take the Minister's figures of only £15 per warrant, it still means that £15 million must be paid—but that figure is way out for the cost of collecting the debt in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: England and Scotland are different. The suggestion that England will follow Scotland is not borne out by our experience. In the second quarter in England this year, a greater proportion of the community charge debit was recovered than in the second quarter last year. Therefore, England is apparently not on the descending curve that the hon. Gentleman argues that Scotland is. The experience of the two countries are not the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall, but I must say that I am determined to make a short speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>965</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all relieved to hear that. Will the Minister accept that the figures prepared months ago on the likely costs of collecting the poll tax will be a substantial underestimate? As the whole process unwinds of taking people to court and issuing warrants against them, it is proving to be a long and costly business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, however inaccurate the Minister's remarks about the level of collection may have been, am I to understand that he has no more specific figures and that he has no idea of what proportion of those obliged to make the minimum 20 per cent. contribution have actually paid the poll tax? We are anxious about that category of people. What they actually pay must be set against the costs of compelling them to pay. Unless the Minister can produce figures on that, he has shot himself out of the water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe so. The obligation of those people to pay is clear. Whether they pay willingly and in a timely fashion may or may not be influenced by what is said by Ministers and by Parliament. That is one of the reasons why I am so keen to make it clear that the process of enforcement and recovery will continue unabated all the way through the coming year of the community charge and after the end of that year. The costs of that recovery—not the costs of billing—will fall to the community charge payers who have defaulted and not to local authorities and to all community charge payers. The costs will be reflected in what the defaulters are asked to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really want to make progress. Let me make it clear that I am now giving way for the last time for quite awhile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I gave the Scottish figures for non-payment, I was talking about the percentages of money that had not been paid to the local authorities. There is a big difference between that and the number of people who have not paid in Scotland. The majority of those who have not paid in Scotland are either on the minimum 20 per cent. or on some benefit, if not the whole rebate. I am not proud of this—in fact, I deplore it—but in some large housing schemes in parts of my constituency where the unemployment rate runs at over 30 per cent. some people do not pay, have not paid and do not intend to pay the poll tax. It would take enormous sums to try to collect it and, in the end, the amount collected would not be worth it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder what the hon. Gentleman's next frontier will be. He seems to believe that if people do not pay a tax, the tax obligation should be removed from them. That is not a defensible position for legislators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me recapitulate and reply to the second point of the hon. Member for Eastbourne by giving the compensation amounts for the 20 per cent. of community charge that must be paid and that are included in income-related benefits for the year. They are £1.31 for single people under 25, £1.48 for single people of 25 and over and £2.62 for couples. Next year those figures will be uprated to £1.40 for single people under 25, £1.58 for single people of 25 and over and £2.80 for couples—yet the 20 per cent. contribution averages
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>966</span>
around 80p a week for single people and £1.60 a week for couples throughout Great Britain. It is evident that the amounts put into community charge benefit are well above the average that people are being asked to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to return to our long discussion on tariff income, but I want to make one point to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), whom I took to imply that local authorities took into account people's actual interest from capital. That is not permitted in law. Authorities take account of the capital and then apply the tariff income, about which we had a debate this morning. There is no double counting; they do not count both the interest and the capital for the tariff income. That is the purpose of the tariff income, so that no more complicated calculation is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to tariff income, but when a local authority advises a widow with £5,000 or £6,000 in capital that her rebate is reduced because of the income that she receives from that capital, it is accepted automatically that the authority is referring to interest. If the Minister has another way of putting tariff income, that should be made clear to such a person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The lady whom the hon. Gentleman describes with £5,000 capital will, for the purposes of the tariff income, be assumed to have an income of £8. That will be applied to the taper, which is currently 15 per cent., so her benefit will be reduced by eight times 15p, which is £1.20. That is how the system works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer now to nurses. The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) quoted from page 3, indent 5 of the leaflet "Council Tax, a Guide for Party Workers" published by Conservative central office, which states:
	<br><q><p>"Students, student nurses, apprentices and YT trainees will automatically be entitled to personal discounts".</p></q>
That statement is absolutely accurate. The hon. Gentleman will recall that student nurses of all descriptions are entitled automatically to personal discounts. The debate about student nurses on Project 2000 and other student nurses has been concerned with their exemption from paying the tax, which is a separate matter. There was no inaccuracy in the briefing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be to the hon. Gentleman's benefit if I continued and replied to his other points about nurses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure because I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is about to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. There was a litle anticipation. The hon. Gentleman's points about student nurses support our side of the argument. A student enrolled at a college in the process of education and in receipt of a bursary, not wages or salary, will be exempt from council tax because he or she is in the student category. People described as student nurses are on all fours with trainees in many other areas of endeavour who receive wages and spend part of their time in study and part in the job. They are liable for national
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>967</span>
insurance contributions and for income tax and are entitled to benefit on the basis of their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield produced many examples of nurses who did not qualify for benefit. That, again, supports our argument—if nurses are paid at a level which would not entitle other people to benefit, why should student nurses, merely because they are so described, be liable to benefit? How would the hon. Gentleman defend the position that because student nurses were so described they were exempt from the tax when trainees in other walks of life were not? Student nurses work on the ward; they do their job and are paid for it. They pay national insurance and income tax. They are on all fours with trainees in other walks of life. That is the only fair way to do it. If we were to pursue the line suggested by the hon. Gentleman there would soon be a long list of deserving cases of people on equivalent incomes who were not exempted from the tax simply because they could not call themselves student nurses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that few student nurses qualify for benefit. Many are under 25 and many are single. Those who are married with a dependent partner or children can qualify for income-related benefit at that level of income. The benefit system is graduated by people's needs, including their family commitments. The hon. Gentleman does not have a strong case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister laboured that point to death last week when we debated clause 4. The flaw in his argument is that if salary were the reason why students were exempted, the Project 2000 exemption also should not apply because those taking part are on the same level of weekly income—there is only 83p difference. The argument is not about salary and income. The Government have used the definition of "employee" to get out of giving equal status to students working in the national health service. By using the words "employee" and "salary" they prevent 55,000 student nurses from benefiting from the Bill, unlike the 7,500 students who will benefit. That is unfair when the two groups of students work and train together for the same profession and, later, the two schemes merge. The issue is not salary but status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national health service has 62,500 student nurses, of which 55,000 are treated radically differently from the other 7,500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument is indeed about status and about the fact that one group are students on a college course, paid by bursary, and the others are employees. Students should not be within the benefits system so we have given them an exemption. People who are not students are within the benefit system and they should qualify. All are equal on the basis of their income on one hand and their needs and responsibilities on the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that all students qualify for the status discount on the basis that they are in receipt of bursaries, or is he saying that a student who is seconded from the civil service or other employment or is sent by his company to be a full-time student for a year or longer and still receives a salary should not be in receipt of that salary? If so, why argue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>968</span>
about the nurses? The Minister cannot make up his mind what a student is. Some are on salaries and some on bursaries within the university or college system. What is the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred this morning to clause 101, which relates to the social security aspect of the Bill. There is a strong and sustainable argument for accepting the amendments to abolish the 20 per cent. payment of poll tax from 1 April 1992. Our argument is weighted in support of abolishing the 20 per cent. payment because there is no justifiable reason why it should remain. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) made it clear that future demand for the 20 per cent. payment from nurses is weighted against student nurses. There is a strong argument for their being allowed the 100 per cent. rebate for the final year of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Carthcart (Mr. Maxton) advised on the Scottish dimension, and he explained that people on low incomes in Scotland are in trouble, first, because the Government insist on the 20 per cent. payment and secondly, because the Scottish National party advised them and left them with a tremendous debt. If the Government have any semblance of sympathy they should give assistance to people in that unfortunate position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that a system based on property would be introduced in 1993 and that it would then be easier to administer the 100 per cent. rebate. Until that time, the system based on a personal payment of tax shall remain because of the legislation. That is no argument for saying that the 20 per cent. payment should not be abolished. Bearing in mind the brief that was circulated to members of the Committee, and given that Conservative Members tabled an amendment in support of the CAB, I make a final plea: if they are sincere about helping people, they are under an obligation to support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the cost to local authorities of the presentation of cases to court and the chasing of those who cannot pay. I have received a circular form the clerk to my local magistrates court, which states that pressure is being put on the court to charge more for cases that are presented to it. At present, a nominal fee of 10p is being charged; that will be raised to £5 per case. Therefore, if 100 cases are presented to court, it will cost local authorities £10. In future, it could cost them £500. That must be paid whether or not the cases are pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities are saying that the sum should be demanded only when the outstanding debt has been recovered. They are worried that so many people are being pursued unsuccessfully for the non payment of the 20 per cent. and, that it will cost them far more in the future as a result of the changes to the court presentation fees as outlined by the Home Office. Therefore, there are significant reasons why the amendment should be accepted by the Government. I appeal to those Conservative Members who support the citizens advice bureaux and the Child Poverty Action Group to support the amendment, which I intend to press to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point on what is, at two lines, an extremely short clause. However, it triggers a series of amendments in the later schedules relating to non-domestic rating, grants and funds. This clause embraces all those topics and, despite its brevity, goes to the heart of the Bill. The philosophy of local taxation is that tax, business rates and the grant system should work together. The professionals call the relationship between those elements the "gearing effect", and it has been most controversial over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not long ago, an Audit Commission report noted some of the broader implications of the proportion of local government revenue expenditure that is met from local taxes. It said:
	<br><q><p>"In 1991–92 the community charge will raise around 22 per cent. of gross local government expenditure; after rebates the figure is only 14 per cent. In 1989–90, by contrast, the last year of the rating system, the proportion of the expenditure funded by locally raised taxes was 57 per cent.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The behavioural consequences of this shift have yet to be seen. Conventional definitions of the conditions in which public bodies are held accountable to their electorates suggest that the new funding balance is inappropriate".</p></q>
The Audit Commission quoted in 1976 Layfield report:
	<br><q><p>"If local authorities are to be acountable they should be responsible to their electorates for both the expenditure they incur and the revenue they raise to finance it, particularly for increases in both".</p></q>
The response of the Audit Commission to that was:
	<br><q><p>"In the case of the community charge regime the government argued that the high gearing on the charge itself would promote local accountability. But in practice that mechanism has been obscured
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>970</span>
by disputes about the appropriateness of the Standard Spending Assessments".</p></q>
That is illustrated even more acutely by the situation in Wales, where the Government propose to retain the proportion of local spending that is raised locally at only 8 per cent. How can any organisation, whether public or private, have any real discretion in running its affairs if 92 per cent. of its income—that is, £11 out of every £12 that it spends—comes from an external paymaster?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, on average, every one percentage point in local authority spending above Government provision will result in a staggering 12 per cent. increase in local tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is unfair that Wales should get a higher percentage of expenditure through revenue support grant from the British taxpayer than many Welsh people—my wife is Welsh—living in England? It is not right that that should be reviewed and that the percentage that comes from central Government to Wales should be reduced to the same percentage as that in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that it is not so much the percentage of grant that is the problem, it is really the non-domestic rate that causes the difficulty of gearing. The hon. Gentleman will, of course, agree that all Governments, whether Conservative or Labour, recognised that there were special social needs in Wales that required a higher level of grant. That has been maintained by successive Secretaries of State for Wales ever since the Welsh Office was brought into existence. However, that is not the issue—it is the relationship between taxes, rates and grants that has meant that local government in Wales is not, in effect, master in its own house. It cannot raise sufficient income without causing a gearing effect—for every pound it must raise there is a 12 per cent. increase in the local taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks about grants, but grants in England, Wales or Scotland, for that matter, simply have not kept up with the increase in inflation. The level of grant has generally been 2 or 3 per cent. below inflation. Taking into account new statutory responsibilities, that has presented a considerable dilemma for local government throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must be taken into account when considering the uniform business rate. Every organisation, except the Government and one or two others, argues that local authority responsibility for non-domestic rates should be restored. The Audit Commission argue that. All the local government associations and the professional bodies say that. The Institute of Directors says it. They all rightly argue that the business rate should be restored after the disaster of the community charge and the business rate over the last two years to ensure that there is a proper linkage between local industry, local business, local commerce and local councils. Those who argue the case most successfully are those large industries which believe that they should be able to talk to the local authority and to influence how it sets its rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>971</span>
That is also the view of small businesses, those that have suffered as a consequence of the introduction of the business rate because Governments of all persuasion failed to revalue over a period of decades rather than years. Many small businesses went to the wall as a direct result of the introduction of the business rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council of Welsh Districts argues that the business rate system has destroyed the accountability link between local authorities and the business communities. It also argues that there should be a close relationship between the local authority supplier and the receiver of local services and that there can be no closer relationship than the setting of charges by the local authority. In areas that are not quite as prosperous as the south-east of England, services that local councils provide to industry and commerce in their areas should be a matter of discussion between the local authority and the relevant users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CWD also said that the relationship between locally situated industry and commerce and local councils should be restored as a major part of enhancing local councils' responsibility and accountability to a major contributor to its costs. For many years, under the old rating system there was never any argument that the rates raised locally should be accountable locally. Many in local government throughout the country, of all parties, would like there to be such a restoration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must also be linked to the question of grants. The gearing effect is quite rightly a combination of all those factors. No one in local government would argue that the present system is not cumbersome, clumsy and complicated. The Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers recently issued a recommendation on the equalisation of resources between local authorities to which it believes all member states could well adhere. One part of it refers to,
	<br><q><p>"taking due account of various requirements, to seek to keep needs assessment models as simple as possible, so as to promote understanding and accountability".</p></q>
Whatever the grant system is, it is neither simple nor understandable. It is not fair either. Instead of dithering over how to replace the poll tax, the Government should have considered how to replace the grant system because it has the most appalling effect on the needs of different areas. The sooner the Government realise that they have to return to resource equalisation and need equalisation, certainly in Wales, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Business rate grants and other factors in schedule 10 are inadequate and unsatisfactory. Unless the business rate is restored to local control, the grant system simplified and made fairer and the gearing factor tackled, local government in Great Britain—certainly in the Principality—will slip away from us. One morning we will wake up and find that local government as a proper democratic process has disappeared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Brandon-Bravo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agreed with so little of what the hon. Gentleman said that I feel I should put my views on the record. He referred to the excellent consultation that used to take place between local authorities and local businesses. That may have happened in his constituency in Wales,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>972</span>
but I have yet to meet any of my colleagues, in towns and cities throughout the country, who have experienced such consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1984, the then Secretary of State introduced legislation to provide for consultation between the business community and the local authority. I told him that it would not work and that Labour authorities would just go through the motions. In our shire county of Nottinghamshire, the business people arrived for the statutory consultation and the then Labour chairman of finance rose to his feet and said, "The Government say that I have to consult with you, gentlemen. This is it. I will tell you what the rate for next year will be." Half the audience got up in a rage and walked out. That was the experience of many of my colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said the local authorities should be allowed to set the rates. All hon. Members will recall that in 1980–81 there were enormous differences between the republic of south Yorkshire and its neighbours. The rates in Nottinghamshire were the third lowest in the country; they were a fraction of the rates in south Yorkshire. As a result, businesses that wanted to trade across the border in the republic sited themselves in north Nottinghamshire. Sadly, Labour won control in 1981 and in four to five years the commercial rates in our area trebled, driving many people out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any new system takes time to bed down. I have no doubt that we could all pick on areas or businesses where UDI is not working as well as we intended, but I am satisfied that it is right in principle. At least businesses, factories, shops and offices know that they will not be hostage to an irresponsible local authority that wants to use their commercial input to jack up their rates and their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I make a small plea. I have ever-growing sympathy with my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman)—one of the southern seats. We are told that Wales has special problems or that Scotland has special problems and that they must have more rate support grant and more help. Conservative Members south of the border with the inner-city seats where there is great deprivation are sick and tired of the constant whingeing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting comment. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that London and the south-east also have problems, I hope that he and his hon. Friends will vote against the Government on regional banding. I look forward to the discussion on that on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view on the clause has been outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), but I want the Minister to respond to a point about the business rate in London. Almost £2 billion leaves London in the business rate each year. I do not object to some redistribution of that, but it is rather like the old system, under the Labour Government, for health—RAWP, the Resource Allocation Working Party—which Conservative Members will remember as they criticised it. I was critical of it also. The principle, that money from wealthier areas would be redistributed to the poorer areas that needed it, was laudable, but in practice money also went away from poor areas

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>973</span>
in London—for example, Hackney, my own borough, and Newham, which are among the poorest boroughs in the country. That fault is replicated in the business rate. The boroughs that lost out under RAWP are losing out again to areas in the north. Will the Minister consider whether some of the business rate that leaves London could be kept in the areas of London that need it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The gearing effect can be seen as a problem, but it is worth remembering why there is a strong gearing effect now. Over the past few years there have been protests, not least from the Labour party, about the sum that people were paying in local taxes, and there have been calls, not least from the Labour party, for more grant to be given to local government. If the amount that local people pay is reduced and if the amount that is redistributed from central taxation is increased, hey presto—the result is a stronger gearing effect. Labour Members have discovered that, to the silver lining that they have been pressing upon us for some time, there is a cloud—a stronger gearing effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the debates in the Committee I have heard from one hon. Member after another more calls for more grants to be given to local authorities, and many speeches to the effect that people were being asked to pay too much in local taxes. The Oppostion cannot have it both ways. The hon. Member for Leyton must recall from his Socialist handbook of demonology that Westminster features prominently in it. I am sure that he would not wish Westminster to be left with all the non-domestic rate income that would accrue from Harrods and the Duke of Westminster's estate, so it is taken in centrally and redistributed. How is it redistributed? It is per capita. On top of that, the revenue support grant is distributed on the basis not of heads, but of need. Hackney, which, as I recall, stands first or second in the entire national pecking order of the standard spending assessment—the Government's view of its need to spend—therefore gets the appropriate amount of revenue support grant to enable it to spend up to its SSA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is a redistribution in terms of the rate support grant, but that is no good for poor areas like Hackney. The money paid in rates by businesses in such areas is being taken away in the same way as it is from businesses in Westminster. The redistribution is more than countered by the money that they lose from their business rates, which they could use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that Hackeny should be able to spend at its standard spending assessment. No matter which direction the money flows, in, the amount that Hackney ends up with, should be its standard spending assessment. That is made up of the amount that it can raise in community charge and the amounts that it gets from the redistributed non-domestic rate pool and in the revenue support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) wanted the business rate to be given back to local authority control to ease the gearing effect. The business rate could ease that effect only if businesses were to pay
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>974</span>
more, because local authority expenditure always rises faster than the rate of inflation. The gearing effect problem is due to local authorities that wish to spend not only faster than the rate of inflation, but faster than the increase in external finance, which they receive from the Government even though external finance tends to rise faster than the rate of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business rate could ease that gearing rate only if it also rose in line with local authority spending, which is faster than inflation and the increase in external finance. The shorthand for what the hon. Gentleman advocates is that businesses should pay more than the rate of inflation in the increase each year in their rate in the pound. If the hon. Gentleman is correct that the Institute of Directors advocates the return of the business rate to local authority control to ease the gearing problem, the institute has either not understood the question or is advocating something that is not in its own interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone but the Minister is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the list is mounting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen also said that unless the business rate is set by the local authority, there will not be a satisfactory dialogue between the local authority and its business community. If that is so, it is a terrible indictment of local authorities. Any local authority should be concerned about its public whether or not they pay taxes and about its business community whether or not it sets the rate for it. Any local authority would surely wish its community to be as prosperous and well provided for as possible. I cannot believe that some conscientious local authorities refuse to indulge in a dialogue with the business community because they no longer set the business rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) is right that even when authorities set the business rate, some did not involve themselves sufficiently with their business Communities. We have taken important steps, not least in the city of Nottingham, with the city challenge initiative, to emphasise that the correct role of the local authority is to perform in partnership with the private sector. It should give leadership to its local community including its private sector and its voluntary organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking so hard to be brief, but I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister speaks about partnership. I wonder whether he will answer the complaint made by the federation of small businesses in Scotland that the Government have abolished the practice of consultations between businesses and local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just responded to that very point. I do not believe that to be the case. It would be a dereliction of duty by local authorities if it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy for Opposition Members, such as the hon. Member for Torfaen, to call for a system of grant that is simpler, more understandable and fairer, but those objectives point in opposite directions, if we want a very fair system, of necessity it must be complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) complained that his local authority had special circumstances that have not been taken into account. The more we simplify the system, the more rough and ready it becomes, which means more rough justice. We have aimed to devise a system that is simpler and more understandable. It is simpler and more understandable—not simple and understandable. However, in the process, I cannot say whether it has become fairer. It is difficult to tell, but if it is simplified much more it will certainly become quite rough and quite ready and there will be rough justice in it. Although it is easy to call for simplification, greater understandability and more fairness, those objectives point in opposite directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have passed almost 60 Acts of Parliament in just over a decade. Some are enormously complicated and it would not be beyond the wit of man to devise a grant system that is both simple and fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the Institute of Directors. He said that he did not believe that the institute would have been foolish enough to make some of the comments to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The excellent Library brief quotes the IOD as saying:
	<br><q><p>"The abolition of the link between what voters pay and what business and other non domestic ratepayers pay towards local government has already resulted in a shift in the tax burden from voters onto non domestic ratepayers in the first year of the new system contrary to the Government's stated intentions when introducing the system"</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not have been in the Chamber yesterday when my hon. Friend the Minister confirmed that, without the new system, businesses would have been paying over this year and next year a total of about £1.8 billion extra.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not in the Chamber yesterday, so I cannot comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to the fact that consultation has not been successful. Nottingham made a farce of it, but that is not the case in most local authorities. For 10 years I was chairman of a local authority finance committee. The dialogue that the Minister wants to take place between local industry and local government cannot be carried out in a series of short meetings over a year. Mutual trust and understanding is necessary between local industry and the local authority when the authority received its income from local businesses, officials knew the directors and managers of factories—often by their first names. That dialogue between industry, commerce and local government has been put in jeopardy as the direct result of this development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. When the sleepy, small hamlet of Llanwern near Newport in Monmouthshire—now Gwent—which has its own parish council, was told that the giant steelworks was to be placed within its boundaries, it meant that the character of that rural area was transformed. The sleepy, rural parish became the site for a huge steelworks. It also meant that the business rates that that parish council drew from that enormous steelworks compensated inordinately for the destruction of the rural life caused by the building of the steelworks. That is a small, but telling example.

The answer to the problen of irresponsible local authorities, which were mentioned by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo), lies not in the creation of a system that produces a bad gearing effect and ends the time-honoured link between local government and local business, but as with most of the Bill's problems, in the ballot box and a proper democratic system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes (Harrow, West)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 68, line 11, after 'oganisations)', insert—
	<br><q><p>(a) there shall be substituted for subsection (11) the following subsection—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"(11) In this section "voluntary organisation' means a body the activities of which are carried on otherwise than for profit but does not include any public or local authority and 'eligible voluntary organisation' means, in relation to Great London, a voluntary organisation whose activities will directly or indirectly benefit either the whole of Great London or any six or more constituent councils and in relation to a metropolitan county a voluntary organisation whose activities will directly or indirectly benefit the whole of that county or any part of it extending beyond the area of any particular constituent council.".</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b)',</p></q>
I have tabled the amendment on behalf of the London Boroughs Association. It is a probing amendment, but is expresses genuine anxiety, and some anger, in London about what is being done in the name of people in my constituency and the fact that it is being done with their money. The amendment would tighten up the criteria for the funding of organisations under the London boroughs grants scheme. Part of the amendment refers to other metropolitan districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, organisations have to prove only that they are of benefit to more than one borough to obtain funding. However, boroughs contribute to the London boroughs grant scheme on a population basis and cannot opt out. The amount that comes from my borough of Harrow is not optional, but a share of a budget decided on by the joint body. The amendment's criterion of six or more boroughs was suggested by the Conservative members of the London boroughs grant scheme. They are not wedded to the precise figure of six.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimalist view is that one or more boroughs is inadequate. It would not be inadequate but for the abuses of the system. We would not need to tighten the rules but for organisations that are active in not much more than one borough. Indeed, it has been suggested that shell organisations have been set up to make those bodies appear to cover wider areas and that causes offence, certainly in my part of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way so early in his speech. I am surprised that he referred to one or more boroughs. That implies that a voluntary organisation may have to operate in only one borough to apply for a grant. I have a note from the London borough grants committee which states:

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>977</span>
	<br><q><p>"The present definition of eligibility requires a voluntary organisation applying for a grant to show that it benefits at least two boroughs".</p></q>
An organisation cannot apply for a grant if it operates in only one borough. It must operate in at least two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I meant that only two boroughs were required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The row within the London borough grants scheme and between the London Boroughs Association and the Association of London Authorities has lasted several years. That is an example of what happens when a worthwhile, vital scheme is misused. Regrettably, the decisions are often political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overwhelming majority of grants are to organisations in the inner London boroughs. I accept that organisations that cover all or part of London may be based in the inner London boroughs. That is not my complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the figures. Overall expenditure for 1991–92 is £28,625,000. We are still in that year so it is not possible to analyse that, but we can consider the analysis of the year 1989–90, which clearly shows what is happening. Some 606 annual grants were made in the year 1989–90 and 295 recipients were located in just four boroughs. Those were Camden, Islington, Lambeth and Westminster. That is 49 per cent. of the total grant. People might think, quite rightly, that that does not necessarily mean that 49 per cent. of the money went to those boroughs. It is worse than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of grants between £20,000 and £50,000, of which there were 201, 53 per cent. went to those four boroughs. Of grants between £50,000 and £100,000, of which there were 82, 58.5 per cent. went to those four boroughs. Of grants over £100,000, of which there were 36, 61.5 per cent. went to organisations based in those four boroughs. The fact that a head office or one location of a London-wide or sub-regional body is based in one of those four boroughs cannot explain why so much money goes to those organisations. My constituents and people in outer London get a raw deal. A ground rule of six or more boroughs would be difficult to adopt. I accept that, certainly in outer London, it would be difficult to prove that many of the organisations—not all of them—served six boroughs. That would not be necessary if there was no abuse, as I consider it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the old GLC, the ground rule was whether a project was, in its essence, sub-regional. If a project genuinely covered a need that existed in several boroughs, it was given money on an all-party basis. Of course, I thought that some grants from the GLC were not made on that basis and I voted against them, but many were funded on an all-party basis because they were genuinely sub-regional. Grants to outer London are the crumbs of the system. When the London Grants Committee is pushed into it we are awarded a few crumbs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have written to me to complain about the amendment. One such letter relates to the Queen's theatre, Hornchurch. The writer complains about the terrible damage that the amendment would cause. Unlike some members of the Committee, I have a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>978</span>
track record on that because, as Conservative opposition spokesman for the arts on the GLC, I voted for grants to be awarded to the Queen's theatre. A grant of £13,000 is small for an important sub-regional theatre, which the Queen's theatre is. Indeed, the £13,500 grant that was given to the Harrow arts centre, for which the theatre was extremely grateful, was small beer compared with what it could use to create a regional arts centre and compared with the £1 million that was givein to the fund by the Conservative-controlled borough council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the London borough of Harrow did not have to pump so much money into the grant scheme as a whole, perhaps it could give even more to the Harrow arts centre. Indeed, it was only after a concerted campaign to persuade the London Grants Committee that the Harrow arts centre had sub-regional significance that it granted it any money at all. It gave none whatsoever last year; it is a late convert to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The borough of Harrow pays £791,200 into the scheme. The borough estimates—it is difficult to know which of the grants benefits in a small or significant way the people of any one borough—that there is about £100,000 coming back to the borough. There are only two grants specifically paid to organisations within the London borough of Harrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and Opposition Members have established that to qualify under the present rules an organisation has to operate in more than one borough. In a genuine spirit of inquiry, I would like to know how it is decided that the Harrow arts centre and the Hornsey theatre, which are clearly established at a single geographic point, operate over more than one borough. I recognise that people attend them from different places and it would be legitimate to argue that they offer a service to more than one borough. Does my hon. Friend know how that is evaluated and how the committee satisfies itself that an organisation is providing a service to more than one borough?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is looked at for an arts centre or theatre is a reasonable travelling distance and where people actually come from. For the Harrow arts centre, the application for money claimed an audience from Harrow, Hillingdon, Barnet, Brent and Ealing. Being near to the edge of Greater London, audiences also come from Three Rivers, Watford and a wider area in Hertfordshire. That is the logic behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second grant to go to an organisation in my constituency is to the community furniture supply scheme. That receives £21,542. It is a genuinely London-wide organisation so it would not be affected by the amendment. It has supplied and completeley furnished, in the past financial year, 28 houses in Harrow; 20 in Barnet; 30 in Hillingdon; 13 each in Lambeth, Southwark and Westminster; 14 in Islington; and 12 in Lewisham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a member of the Social Services Select Committee before it split, we looked at a number of projects that were grant-aided under the scheme for the mentally ill homeless and the physically disabled homeless. We were about to look at some of the facilities for women who suffer physical violence in the home. Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>979</span>
amendment will assist the continuation of such projects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because I was just about to come to that point. There are 10 outer-London refuges that are funded by the London boroughs grant scheme, but unfortunately not the one in Harrow. Because it is an area about which I have some background knowledge—the refuges, not the violence—I accept that some people from Harrow go to other refuges for the sake of anonymity. I know of one constituent who spent time in the refuge in Ealing. If a network of such refuges is funded on the basis of swaps between them, all should be funded. That matter should be examined more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who know nothing about the subject would assume that Chiswick women's aid is a local organisation. Those of us who have known that organisation since it was started by Mrs. Erin Pizzey will know that it is of national significance and it is right that it is funded to a large extent by the London boroughs grant scheme. For the sake of brevity, I shall draw a veil over the Labour party's record on Chiswick women's aid unless hon. Members challenge me upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not answered my question. Of the 30 centres in London, he has named 10 outer London centres, but he has excluded the other 20. On average, they save the particular London borough from which the women come approximately £300 a week in accommodation costs. If, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, the amendment is not meant to attack such services and is not anti London but simply pro Harrow, the hon. Gentleman owes the Committee an explanation of the safeguards that would ensure continued funding for all 30 current women's aid centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. However, if it were completely reasonable, the women's aid centre in Harrow would be funded by the London borough grants scheme as it takes—as it should—people from other parts of London. The amendment is not intended to disrupt that important and vital service—in reality, there is no likelihood that that would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should look at my track record. When I was a member of Hounslow borough council I tabled a motion against the Labour controlled council when it tried to close Chiswick women's aid. It is no credit to either party that I was denied a seconder to that motion—indeed, I was nearly thrown out of the Tory group. The Labour party attacked the aid group, but no party can gain much credit from that incident. Perhaps I was the only person prepared to support Chiswick women's aid at that time because I was the only member of the council who had visited it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to go down the byways of the hon. Gentleman's previous life, but we are not dealing with his previous life; we are debating the amendment. If it were approved, it would threaten some of the 30 institutions. That such a threat is real is the view of not only Labour Members but those who are involved with caring for women and children who have suffered appalling violence in the home. It is all very well for us to stand here in a complete vacuum and play political ping-pong across the Committee when, tonight in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>980</span>
London, significant numbers of women will suffer physical and mental abuse. They require the facilities provided by the 30 centres. We are discussing not a way to improve assistance for those women, but a back-door method of closing some of the centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make the hon. Gentleman an offer: we are prepared to support funding in Harrow to make 31 centres, if he will withdraw his amendment and safeguard the other 30 centres in London. That is a reasonable offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the hon. Gentleman displays to the Committee his painful ignorance of London politics and of the background to such organisations. We have heard similar scare stories before. When the Greater London council was abolished, we were told such stories. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman should complain about me telling a story about my past, when the Committee knows him like a brother—we know so much about his early life, because he tells us every day. The history of the issue is important, but the fact is that my political friends in London and, of course, Labour councillors, want to protect that vital service. If so much money were not wasted funding organisations that are, in my judgment, purely political, more money could be spent on those vital services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue that there is a structural difference, and the hon. Gentleman argued that that will somehow disrupt a service. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I would not disrupt that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the hon. Gentleman another anecdote. If he drove down Chiswick High Road he would see a magnificent building which houses the Brentford and Chiswick Labour party—it is next door to Chiswick family rescue. Had the Labour party not gazumped Chiswick women's aid, that organisation would have been housed in the Labour party's building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to trade insults with the hon. Gentleman or argue whether one political party does more than another to help such organisations. We are discussing the important issue of the protection of women who are trying to escape domestic violence, which is endemic in our society. The hon. Gentleman said that he has made a long commitment to protecting those services. A wide range of organisations, that are not party political have advised us that, whatever the hon. Gentleman's intention, the amendment would put at risk, for example, women's refuges, Given the hon. Gentleman's comments I am sure that he would not want that to happen. Such services could not be funded if it were left only to the boroughs to pick up the tab. I ask him to reconsider, and withdraw his amendment. I do not agree with his argument about how grants are given out in London. However, to approach the issue from a different angle, the amendment would threaten services that are vital to the most desparate women in our society—those who are trying to escape domestic violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounded reasonable, but on examining what is happening in Greater London, it is less reasonable. In my judgment and that of other people who care about those vital services, many of

the decisions are political. Some organisations provide little benefit, and do not do what they claim to do. They do not reach their targets. When I was on the Greater London council, I supported several organisations to teach English to Asian women, many of whom were trapped in their homes, unable to speak English and unfamiliar with their surroundings. It is vital to have organisations to do field work and teach English to such women. When I stood as Conservative candidate in the Bermondsey by-election—I shall draw a veil over how many votes I received—I examined the work of those organisations, some of which I had notionally supported. It became clear that they were nothing more than political cells. They were doing nothing to teach English. We in the GLC had a cosy feeling that we had given much money to teach English to Asian women, yet the money was not getting through to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, we are not discussing the GLC, or whether some of the projects represent the best way to deliver their declared aims. We are debating an amendment that could threaten women's refuges. The hon. Gentleman said that he has a long track record of supporting such organisations. On that basis alone, it is not unreasonable to ask him to withdraw the amendment. He is using the wrong method to deal with the problems that he claims to identify. Given the goodwill in committee as we approach the end of our proceedings, will the hon. Gentleman withdraw the amendment and adopt another approach to the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.20–6.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention displayed all the understanding of London politics that I would expect from a Member of Parliament who represents Bristol. If the hon. Lady does not understand the direct historical link between the London borough grant scheme and the grant giving capabilities of the GLC, she does not understand what we are talking about. The system in use is not working to the advantage of many people in London. Some of the schemes that are being funded are political and are, therefore, not ones that should command support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have a more equitable system. I accept that it is fair that law centres in Hillingdon, Paddington, central London, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Tower Hamlets are funded by the London borough grant scheme, but who says that my constituents do not need legal advice? Why did the committee choose those boroughs? Was it because the Labour party used its majority with the Liberal Democrats under the London borough grant scheme to vote for grants in their areas as opposed to voting for grants in other areas of London?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme does not work. Far from protecting everyone, it only protects some people at the expense of others. I accept that some London boroughs put in more money than is coming out, but if that did not happen to such a large extent, they could fund more organisations in their own areas. I wish to quote from one of the many letters that I have received on the matter. The London Advice Services Alliance stated:
	<br><q><p>"It will … prove difficult to convince the different local authorities that their funding will equitably benefit their residents rather than those of another borough."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>982</span>
That is precisely my point, and I am grateful to the alliance for supporting my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is genuine worry about the scheme. There are those who need help, advice and access to the arts every bit as much as do those people who have received money under the London borough grant scheme. That feeling of injustice and resentment will not disappear, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider what can be done to make the scheme work more fairly and bring more help to those areas to which I have referred tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to use a small point to encourage the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) to withdraw the amendment. As he referred to letters, I shall refer to a letter that was written to the Minister by the Westminster Diocese of Social and Pastoral Action, which states:
	<br><q><p>"I write concerning the Amendment 223 tabled by Mr. Robert G. Hughes, MP, which seeks to restrict the funding role of the London Boroughs Grants Committee to make grants to voluntary organizations which can prove benefit to at least six London Boroughs.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The Diocese of Westminster takes a close interest in the workings of the LBGC because of its importance to the voluntary sector and you will know that the Cardinal together with the then Bishop of London earlier this year urged the Committee to set a Budget after a long and damaging delay. We are concerned that Mr. Hughes' amendment may reintroduce uncertainty into the scheme and exclude a wide range of projects funded under the 'Pattern of Provision' programmes such as Women's Refuges, Single Homeless projects, Drug and Alcohol services and some Refugee groups.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>There is already great concern in the voluntary sector about the possible disruption to the grant-making process for the coming year and the problems of persuading up to five local authorities each with their own criteria to fund projects and organizations.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>We think the government were right not to change the present arrangement whereby groups that benefit more than one borough can be funded. We welcome too the general intention of Clause 103 to give an element of stability to the Scheme. We hope that the Government will resist Mr. Hughes' amendment which will have the opposite effect."</p></q>
6.25–6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman thinks that this is a partisan political debate, I urge him to think again. Some people may well pay the price if the amendment is accepted and they will be among the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. They should not be asked to pay it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) has done us a great service in tabling the amendment because by doing so, he has highlighted a system that is perceived as unacceptable by a growing number of boroughs in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate my comments on structure rather than on the political nuances of where grants are going, because it is the structure that is wrong. First, I give a background figure for the Committee to consider. In the current year, my borough of Havering is allocating about £961,200 of its charge payers' money for the London borough grant committee to spend, and that is taken from an overall budget of about £28 million. In return, three organisations in Havering receive support. The first is the Queen's theatre, mention by my hon. Friend. That excellent building is in the heart of my constituency and it serves about five boroughs whose inhabitants attend it. Furthermore, because it is on the edge of the old Greater London
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>983</span>
area, it attracts a significant number of people from Essex proper, from as far away as Chelmsford, Southend and Basildon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's theatre provides a tremendous service and I have received a letter from the organisation. Like many grant recipients, it writes because, understandably, it feels that the amendment would threaten its grant. With great respect to Opposition Members who have already made the point, they are missing the central issue completely. We are discussing not whether such organisations are funded but how they are funded and whether present accountability is true and fair. I submit that it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second organisation that is funded is Women's Aid in Havering, also an excellent body that covers only two boroughs. I checked that information today and it covers my borough and that of Barking and Dagenham. It should be possible for those two boroughs to negotiate a way to support the Women's Aid organisation without involving the London borough grants committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keither Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend consulted the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on the issue? If he has, I, presume that he will have gained the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I should have consulted the hon. Gentleman if I were engaged in resolving the level of grant. As my hon. Friend said, if the hon. Member for Dagenham were present, he would agree that it was a worthwhile project.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that it should be easy for two boroughs to agree to fund the Women's Aid centre, but what will happen if one of them will not agree? Would that centre have to close down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about every day, week in, week out, decision-taking in boroughs throughout the country. They might even decide that the amount should be enhanced, especially in view of the sums that both Harrow and Havering are putting into the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and final organisation that is funded in the borough of Havering is the Barking, Havering and Brentwood alcohol advisory service of which I am an honorary vice-president. That covers three boroughs, two in and one outside London. Again, that need not concern the overwhelming number of London boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go further. It is nonsense to expect the constituents of my hon. Friends the Members for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) and for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) to fund those organisations. If I add a further three organisations that are not in my borough but from which my borough will benefit in the same way as other boroughs are benefiting from Havering's grant, there are six or seven organisations making a bid for a similar figure of £100,000, for which my charge payers, and the rest of the Havering charge payers, will pay almost £1 million. It is not the money but the structure that is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>984</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument has been heard before. He will now argue against the uniform business rate and in favour of areas retaining the whole of the rate raised for industrial rates. With the uniform business rate, the same practice occurs. Money is taken from one area and used to provide services in another. The hon. Gentleman voted for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am clear about one thing. I maintained throughout the previous Bill's debates on the community charge, or poll tax, that the UBR is essential and central: first, because it is part of national taxation and, secondly, because no votes were involved. There was no democratic accountability between businesses and the local council. Unless the hon. Lady can see the difference between those who are charge payers and, accordingly, have votes, and businesses, which have no votes, it will be difficult for me to get the point through to her. A Committee would sit in London determining where this enormous wad of money will go. I am not commenting on whether the decisions are good or bad, but the concept is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said that six is a reasonable number. He said that his amendment was a probe: he would be the first to say that nothing is set in concrete and that six is the right figure. What his amendment does is to say that there are London-wide groups that deserve support and that there are sub-London groups covering a substantial chunk of London that deserve support. What I question—this is at the heart of the matter—is whether the current unwiedly system—which, in recent years, has produced many problems when agreement was attempted—is the right way for support for organisations that cover a small number of London boroughs to be determined. I think not. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to recognise that even if we do not make a change in this Bill, there is still need for a change in the system, because it is not working properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the amendment were carried, it would have serious consequences for a number of voluntary organisations in London. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) mentioned some: Women's Aid and women's refuges, some of which could be forced to close. Both I and other hon. Members have had many letters on the subject. Some have been from important umbrella organisations such as the London boroughs grants committee, the London Voluntary Service Council, the London Advice Services Alliance, the Law Centres Federation, the London Arts Board, the London Diocesan Board for Social Responsibility, which my hon. Friend mentioned, and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Those are a few of the many which have expressed deep anxiety.

organisations, including Proud Old Lesbians, the Irish Lesbian Network and the Turkish Lesbian Group. Does the hon Gentleman seriously beleive that such a unit has any right to obtain funds from taxpayers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.35–6.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is, as usual, totally devaluing a debate about an important matter. I hope that you will permit me a small diversion, Sir Michael, to answer him. Would he support cutting off funds to organisations in London that help, for example, young homosexuals who are fearful of AIDS and who may be about to commit suicide? Would he cut off money to the Samaritans? That is the consequence of his argument. Let us hear no more of that stuff and nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London boroughs grants committee says that the amendment would disadvantage outer-London boroughs. It wrote:
	<br><q><p>"Outer London boroughs, particularly in south London, are far larger than the inner London boroughs. Whilst it may be a relatively straightforward matter to benefit six inner London boroughs stretching, say from Hammersmith and Fulham to Hackney, it would be very much more difficult to find a ring of six outer London boroughs or a mixture of outer and inner boroughs where such benefit was achieved. The effect of the amendment would be to concentrate more benefit on groups largely operating in the inner London boroughs. Thus the amendment would not achieve one of its stated objectives."</p></q>
That is a key point, which the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) should bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure of the London boroughs grants committee arose from commitments that the Government gave when the Greater London council existed. Voluntary organisations feared that all their grants would be cut, so the Government gave them categoric assurances. If the amendment is accepted, it would erode those assurances. The Minister should consider that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways the problem is an inter-London boroughs squabble. The hon. Member for Harrow, West admitted that its source was the London Boroughs Association. The London boroughs board contains representatives from all local authorities and all the political parties that are active in those authorities. They vote on applications, which is a reasonable way to deal with them. It is certainly a better way than making the Minister consider the details of each appliation, and it is preferable to a quango.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, the matter is not political. The officers of the London boroughs grants committee are scrupulously fair when considering applications. I have supported applications in my constituency but have had them turned down. If the system was political they would, quite frankly, have been carried. The hon. Gentleman gave away his argument when he said that the system was purely political. The truth of the matter is that the Conservative party is not in control in London. Therefore it wants to scrap the system. That is a poor way to deal with local government and other decision-making bodies in London. If the Conservative party were in control in London, it could consider applications as it wanted and change grant distributions. The hon. Gentleman said that it would do that, so I do not understand why he is complaining and grousing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>986</span>
now, simply because it does not have overall control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay through the nose in poll tax towards services in London. That entitles me to speak about them in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the services that are provided would have to be London-based, irrespective of the party-political complexion of the grants committee. For example, care of the mentally ill and of the physically disabled homeless has to be London-wide because there is no way to identify the borough from which the vast majority of those people came. Many of them have come out of institutional care. Many of the mentally ill could not even say where they came from, nor how they arrived in London. The only criterion for the services provided to them is that those people are mentally ill and homeless. The introduction of a system that ties projects to funding on the artificial basis that they must prove that their clients come from at least six London boroughs would wreck overnight the concept of care in the community for the most vulnerable. In effect, a legal cosh is being used for political reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. friend is right. There are dangerous consequences for community care and other services. That also shows the strength of the case for the centres set up by inner London authorities for women and the homeless. The grants committee nearly always accepts the case for such projects, because people only have to get on a train or a tube and travel to central London. That is one of the reasons why the distribution is skewed, for the right reasons, in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrow, West says that he is not wedded to the figure of six boroughs. However, even if those organisations had to cut across four or five boroughs, who would make the decisions for organisations that cut across two and four boroughs, or two and five? There would be a gap. If the amendment, or something like it, were accepted, the grants committee would have to review the grants to several hundred voluntary organisations, with resulting chaos and loss of service. Under threat would be women's refuges, hostels for single homeless men and women, services for drug and alcohol abusers and legal advice centres. Other projects, such as the outer-London arts scheme and the inter-sports initiative would also be in danger. In my own borough, a centre for Kurdish people would be put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an intra-London grouse. The Minister need not get involved. It can be sorted out within the present structure, but it is important that the valuable work of those organsiations is not threatened. They must carry on so that vulnerable people in London can continue to benefit from their services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I know that hon Members, are grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) for giving this topic an airing. He has raised a real problem, although I do not agree entirely with his solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must declare an interest. I am a director of the Battersea Arts Centre and of the London Actors'

Theatre Company, both of which seek and sometimes receive grants from the London boroughs grants scheme. I should add that I served a year of purgatory when I was involved in the first year of the London boroughs grants scheme. The problems of bureaucracy meant that money was taken from one pocket and put into another. Matters have since improved. I have experienced at first hand all the problems that my hon Friends mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the difficulties of finding out precisely what it is that one is contributing to. I have to declare an interest. I represent a borough that contributes twice as much money to the fund as is returned to organisations within the borough. That money might help genuine cases of need elsewhere in London. However, I suspect that much of it is wasted or lost in bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the current system is right. The London boroughs grants scheme decides not only between organisations that compete for funds; it must also decide its priorities between social service, employment, education, environmental and, as the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) said, sports organisations, as well as may own interest, the arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the headline in 	<i>The Stage and Television Today</i> on 11 April 1991 read:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Vote Labour and Arts Will Suffer",
<br><br><!-- lb -->
it did not attack the Labour party for its art policy, or its failure, as the party in control, with the Liberals, of the London borough grants scheme, to fulfil promises. It highlighted the Labour party's discovery that the system was inadequate and was, therefore, letting down the arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West has put forward a proposal. He claims that the amendment is probing and that six is not a sacrosanct number. The six-borough concept might prove difficult. My hon. Friend the Minister shared my reservations. If one examines how many boroughs send audiences to the Battersea Arts Centre, the centre could qualify under six, five or 10-borough rules. However, if one considers the centre's educational work, it is more difficult to prove its relevance to six boroughs. People could then ask questions about the national work carried out by the centre. A national puppet resource is based there. If its touring work outside London is considered, one would encounter the problem of extending the rule requiring six-borough status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem will not be solved until we abolish the London boroughs grants scheme completely and find a better method of allocating resources, or channel money for the arts through the London Arts Board. I suspect that there are also better methods of funding social service organisations. The London boroughs grants scheme recognises its own problems. The London boroughs certainly know the problems. The organisations that receive, or fail to receive, funding from that source are aware of the problems under the present system. It should be changed, but I question the multi-borough requirement described in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To come clean, I support the views
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>988</span>
expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis). It is a good thing that debates in Committee are not resolved in the same way as a boxing match. If my ministerial colleagues and I were judges at a boxing match and had to award the decision on points, there would be no doubt about the winner. My hon. Friends had the best of the argument. They addressed serious issues about the London boroughs grants scheme, which is supposed to award grants to bodies that are relevant to all of London. Opposition Members raised one scare story after another. They addressed the particular and responsed, as always, with claims that this or that body would close down, with one honourable exception, they have not considered the merits of the case, or the practicalities that have concerned my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable exception was the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) who made two halfway-decent points. First, he accepted the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) that it would be easy to see how arrangements would be made between two boroughs, but he asked what would happen to those in between if six boroughs were chosen in which the body should operate. Secondly, he invited Ministers to keep out of the matter and to leave it to the London boroughs, an argument with which I have much sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In raising the issue, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) did the Committee a great service, as my hon. Friend for Hornchurch said. If we did not recognise that difficulties were involved in the London boroughs grant scheme, the clause would not be in the Bill. It is precisely because we have run into difficulties that we have taken the unusual step of introducing these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West to ask him how the coverage of a body located in a particular geographical spot was assessed. He may have realised then the direction of my reasoning. I recognise strongly the difficulties involved and the emotions aroused in Harrow and Havering about how the system operates; it is my duty as a Minister to consider the practical consequences and to attempt to find practical solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members did not make their points well, but some of what they said was not irrelevant: account must be taken of what would happen to existing bodies if the rules are changed. I am anxious that we should achieve what my hon. Friend wants, but I am not certain how one could define how many boroughs benefit from a particular organisation. I envisage many ways by means of which either the figures could be massaged or contrivances could be arranged to comply with any new rule. An organisation that currently operated in two boroughs could respond to the need to operate across six boroughs by taking on clients from six boroughs, or by establishing a presence, or a poste restante, there to continue to qualify. That would not be a useful way to spend money. An organisation may not be at its most efficient if it operates in that way. An organisation that did not operate in that way, might, none the less, have significance for London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Harrow, West and Hornchurch won the argument by saying that there is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>989</span>
problem and that the London boroughs grants committee should concern itself with the funding of bodies that have either a broad significance for London or an innovatory role—bodies for example, that are consistent with the criteria already laid down in section 48 of the Local Government Act 1985. It states that a voluntary organisation will be eligible to receive funding under a joint scheme by the London boroughs if it is directly or indirectly of benefit to the whole of greater London, or the area of more than one borough. That is qualified in the present rules governing the London boroughs grant scheme, which specify that an organisation must either provide a service for the benefit of London as a whole, contribute to a London-wide strategy, or provide a service of an innovative character or of potential benefit to the whole of London. There is a further safeguard: that individual boroughs should be able to challenge the eligibility of any organisation. Those criteria exist, but I understand, as my hon. Friends said, that there are practical difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not unwilling to be convinced that there is a problem, but I am not convinced that the correct solution is that which has been offered by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West. No one has sufficiently thought through its practical consequences. We have not considered how bodies might seek to comply with the idea, or the damage that we might do. I must frankly tell my hon. Friends that I am not convinced by their argument. If they wish to pursue the matter, research it further and speak to me, I am all ears. At this stage it is only fair to say that, although I am sympathetic, I am not convinced of the course that they advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We, too, oppose the amendment. It is puzzling that the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) should have tabled it, except to provide an opportunity to express the range of prejudice and spleen with which we have become familiar when it comes to matters relating to London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee. I realise that hon. Members have duties that take them out of the Room, but had the hon. Gentleman been present during my speech he would have understood that my point, which buttressed that of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes), was about the structure of the decision-taking, not the direction of grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, and I heard a good part of the hon. Gentleman's speech. I was struck, during the speech of the hon. Member for Harrow, West, which was a decent one, by the way that he moved the amendment almost as a duty on behalf of the London Boroughs Association. His heart was not in it and he had no confidence in the amendment. He
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>990</span>
described it as a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He was trying, however, not to probe the Minister's mind but the extent of disaffection among Conservative Members and to provide an opportunity for his hon. Friends to express their familiar range of prejudice and spleen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into detail, because Conservative Members backed off every time that they were challenged about the amendment's effects on particular instances. They backed off with good reason. There is overwhelming evidence from many organisations and institutions, including several umbrella organisations, of the damage that the amendment would do to voluntary work in the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by quoting a letter from which my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen)—or it may have been my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle)—has already quoted. The letter was written to the Minister by the director of the London Diocesan Board for Social Responsibility. The most interesting passage is to be found in the last paragraph, which says:
	<br><q><p>"Perhaps the most worrying aspect of this amendment is that it demonstrates a growing concern for the wealthier parts of London to disassociate themselves from the most needy areas on which, in effect, the outer areas are dependent."</p></q>
That lack of community and solidarity in London, which is so typical of the Conservative party, imbues the amendment. The irony is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton said, that the amendment would produce the reverse of the outcome that Conservative Members wish to achieve. I am glad that the Minister decided to oppose the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Harrow, West will now withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is right to say that I was doing more than simply probing for the Minister's view. I made it clear early in my speech that the six boroughs concept was that of the Conservative group on the London borough grants committee. They are entitled to that view and have lived with those decisions over the past few years. I seek to find a way of doing what my hon. Friend the Minister suggested, which I would call meeting genuine sub-regional or all-London needs. I am grateful for the way that the hon. Member for Dagenham phrased it; I genuinely want to see those needs met. However, it is only because the structure is inadequate that there is a clamour to change it; indeed, that is the only reason for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concerns of the London Diocesan Board for Social Responsibility and other organisations. They are recipients of the grants. Many of them would continue to be centrally funded, some by joint agreements between boroughs, some by individual boroughs. Those who are not from London must realise that London is a patchwork quilt of areas of wealth and deprivation. It is not simply that the centre suffers deprivation and that the rim is wealthy. London is more complex than that. However, many good organisations serving areas of real need need support. The receive no funds at all. That system does not commend itself.

The one thing I did not like, although it did not surprise me, was that unnecessary fears were raised during the debate. Some of those remarks could join what I call the annual fixture—like saying that old-age pensioners' bus passes will go. We get it every year.

They raise unnecessary fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being extremely provocative.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon.

There he will find out about London's bus pass scheme, see that it has been supported by all parties since its inception and that I, as a member of the GLC and subsequently as a Member of Parliament, voted for it. It was started by the GLC. The Government took it over with a reserve scheme in case the boroughs could not agree. It will not go. It is a scare to suggest that it is in danger. Perhaps unwittingly—perhaps without knowing what he is talking about—the hon. Gentleman has started the scare once again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a good debate although I am worried about the unnecessary fears. I am particularly concerned about the irresponsible remarks of the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Putting that to one side—as we usually can with whatever the Liberal party says—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Do you have a note that amendment No. 268 is to be moved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entitled to move it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 268, in page 68, line 2, leave out from 'before' to end of line 24 and insert
	<br><q><p>"the thirty-first day of January,'.</p></q>
The amendment stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) who unfortunately has had to leave the Committee. She tabled the amendment on behalf of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations. It is designed to highlight the uncertainty that voluntary organisations face from year to year about their funding and to see whether anything can be done to make their funding more certain. The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to intervene should funding for voluntary organisations under section 48 not be agreed by a particular date. The date that we have in mind is 31 January. We would like that date to be included in the Bill if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of a fixed date has the support of some local authorities and is certainly supported by the London Voluntary Service Council. It would allow local authorities a realistic period of time in which to assess their financial situations before committing themselves to section 48 schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a small amendment, but it would provide greater certainty. I appreciate that it may not be approved, but it is important to try to find a way to safeguard the funding of voluntary schemes. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give it a fair wind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) for raising this point. It allows me to make the Government's view clear beyond peradventure and to report the progress that has been made. When deciding on a date for a deadline it is necessary to balance two demands. First, the voluntary sector needs to know for planning purposes what level of funding it might expect in the forthcoming financial year. Secondly, the participating local authorities need time to weigh up the pros and cons of who should be funded against other demands on their resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those factors vary from year to year. What might seem an appropriate date this year may not be in a few years time. We also need to take account of the fact that section 48 schemes exist not only in London but in some metropolitan counties as well. At present we see no need for this new device to be applied outside London, but we should not fetter our discretion; we should use it should the need arise. It may become
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>993</span>
necessary to set a deadline that applied to schemes in metropolitan counties, but 31 January might not be a sensible date for particular schemes because of their rules. We would not want to be hampered by a specific date in the Bill, nor would we want to put ourselves in the position where the dates could not easily be altered, if experience showed that another date would work better in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the amendment was probably tabled to establish the Secretary of State's view of a suitable date. I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North. We have already made it known that we consider 31 January to be a suitable deadline. We held a consultative meeting with officials last July which various organisations, including the NCVO, attended. The proposals now embodied in clause 103 were discussed. At the meeting we did not discuss a specific date for a deadline, but in a circular letter of 1 November organisations that had attended were told that 31 January was the proposed date. We have no reason to believe that they object to that or disagree with it. Our view is that the amendment is designed to seek confirmation that 31 January is the date chosen, and the first year that it will apply is 1993–94.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North understands the advantage of retaining flexibility and the difficulties that might arise if we put the date in the Bill. I hope, therefore^ that he will be persuaded to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said, which will certainly be considered by the NCVO. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clause 103 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 104</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>COUNCIL TAX AND COMMUNITY CHARGES: RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 274, in page 68, line 39, leave out 'two' and insert 'twelve'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 104 refers to the restrictions on voting for those who have not paid their council tax and community charge. The amendment is designed to alter the period of that restriction. We tabled the amendment so that the Government could consider whether two months was the right period, and so that the Committee could probe the Government and find out whether their original response was simply a knee-jerk reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must decide, first, whether disqualification from voting is appropriate for an elected member of a body who has not paid his council tax or community charge. If the answer is yes, the next question is whether the period of two months in the Bill is appropriate. I suggest that two months is too short a period and is, therefore, inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many examples of people who, for administrative reasons, have failed to pay accounts within a two-month period. The cases reported in the newspapers are always the most interesting, but it is not only the daughter of the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) who, through oversight, fails
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>994</span>
to pay an account. Many people fail to pay their accounts on time, but when the matter is drawn to their attention, they rectify the situation fairly quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the discussion of the Bill, we have heard many comments about Labour Members of Parliament and councillors who have not paid their community charge. I could have given the example of a Conservative councillor in the area of Peacehaven in Sussex who failed to pay his community charge for a long time, even when reminded, but eventually did pay. Those are political matters. We must ensure that the Bill will work in practice, and the amendment is designed to ensure that the principle is sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banks can make mistakes, and do so with increasing frequency. They fail to pay standing orders and often get direct debits wrong. It can certainly take more than a couple of months to sort out an error by a bank. Bills can go astray, accounts may not arrive on time and cheques sent through the post may not be received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those sorts of errors seem to be increasing all the time in our society. There are genuine errors. If there has been a bank error or a cheque has gone astray, two months is a short period of time to rectify the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not think that legislators, such as ourselves, and councillors with 28 years of experience such as he has, should be above reproach in such matters? Far from having 12 months or even two months grace, in my personal view, they should be disqualified instantly they are behind in such matters. As elected councillors, people have an absolute duty and should be given not more elbow room, but less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention is interesting. If we believe that local authorities should be representative of their community and that local councillors should represent local people, there will be a percentage of councillors as there are people within the community who have genuine reasons why they cannot immediately pay a bill on the day that it is received. The hon. Gentleman suggested that if a councillor is one day behind with a bill, he or she should cease their duties as a councillor. That is preposterous. The conclusion of that argument is that only those people who are in credit at the bank should stand for office. If that were the position, councils would not be representative of their communities because very few people in this recession have funds in the bank in advance of the need to pay bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservatives Members should try to imagine being councillors on extremely low allowances and low-paid jobs. If they had to choose between paying their gas bill or being rigorously up to date with the poll tax, which would they choose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful intervention. There are a proportion of councillors on every local authority in genuine financial hardship. There are examples of local councillors who, when trying to draw quite small sums of money in support of their activities in attending council meetings, fall foul of Government legislation which stops them from drawing unemployment benefit. Some councillors are actually worse off
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>995</span>
than other people out of work who can draw benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Members attention to lines 6, 7 and 8 on page 69 which state:
	<br><q><p>"He shall at the meeting … disclose the fact that this section applies to him and shall not vote on any question with respect to the matter."</p></q>
That answers the question of whether he is stuck with the gas bill or any other bill. He does not have to resign as a councillor, but he may not vote. As an elected councillor he should be better than everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the hon. Gentleman the first time and he said that if a councillor was one day behind with the council tax he should not be allowed to vote. Denying someone's right to vote after he has been duly and properly elected is a serious matter and I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman. From his other comments, he has never before appeared so extreme. I am surprised that he should want to deny the democratic right of an elected person to exercise his vote on behalf of the people who have elected him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are cases of genuine hardship among councillors and it is wrong to say that they should be denied the rope—I am sorry, I mean the vote—just because they have not got money in the bank. We are returning to the dark ages when people had to have money to come to his place. Will that be extended to Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause should be opposed because it is vindicative. The House should not create legislation that will make it difficult in practice for people to judge the situation. Councillors up and down the country will not be 100 per cent. sure whether their cheque has reached the town hall. Two months is a short period to ensure that the bank has paid the money and that it has been receipted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all the administrative chaos caused by the poll tax, it would be wrong to introduce legislation to make it even more difficult to check things out. Such a system creates an atmosphere between an elected member of a local authority and the treasurer, who is the proper officer to decide whether a payment has been received. This is the very time at which we should be building bridges between central and local Government with finance to deliver the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell from their expression that those on the Government Front Bench do not believe in partnership between central and local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Gentlemen say that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say it because of the expression of ridicule on the face of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales when I suggested that we should build bridges to those who deliver local services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr Nicholas Bennett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that, just because we find what the hon. Gentleman says to be absolute nonsense, our reaction has to be interpreted as meaning that central Government do not want a partnership with local government. The hon. Gentleman refers to problems that a councillor would have with his local authority treasurer and to the fact that the two would not have a partnership of trust. That is a completely different argument. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>996</span>
Government have been very supportive of local government. They have given it more powers and additional financial support to do its job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the evidence supported that view, the Government would have rushed to the ballot box much earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to restore a bit of liberty. The clause is an infringement of individual liberty and local democracy. Plenty of safeguards exist in our society for people who do not pay their bills and they can be used in the proper way. The removal of the right to vote is an extension of the clause's vindictiveness, which is not apparent in the rest of the Bill. The clause stands out on its own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the vindictiveness of clause 104. Conservative members of the Committee would not agree to the Committee's being suspended before we voted on the clause so that all hon. Members could produce their poll tax bills to show that their payments were up to date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It can be pretty difficult in Lambeth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No excuses will be accepted. In other debates on the Floor of the House, hon. Members should not be expected to declare that they are not indebted to any institutions. Conservative Members do not propose that system for themselves and should not propose it for others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is absolutely right. Her remarks have moved me closer to my conclusion. Ministers in other Departments do not suggest that people who speed in their motor cars should not vote on transport legislation. That is a good analogy. The principle behind an elected democracy is that everyone plays his right part in it. We do not bar individuals. No one has suggested that Members of Parliament who have not paid their poll tax should be barred from voting in Committee. The Government are once again picking on local authorities and on elected councillors and seeking to restrict what they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

know the Labour party's position on the amendment. Only yesterday the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said that the Labour party supported the clause, and I recall him making great play of it earlier in our deliberations—to try to steal the Tories' clothing, as he might have put it. Yet today, the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) said that she hoped that there would be a vote so that she could record her dissent from the clause. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) seemed also to support the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti). If I have misinterpreted the hon. Member for Bristol, South, and if she does not support the arguments of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, I apologise and shall withdraw my comments. I shall certainly look at 	<i>Hansard</i> because my impression is that she supported the hon. Member for Eastbourne.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind Conservative Members quoting me; I just wish that they would quote me correctly.

I am glad to hear the majority of Opposition Members will support the clause. I am surprised that the Liberal Democrat representative on the Committee describes it as ludicrous, vindictive and crazy that we propose to require members of local authorities to do what they expect of other citizens in the community. The hon. Member for Eastbourne used the words "denied the rope": I shall give him plenty of rope if he wishes. He seems to think that those who set the council tax and levy it on their fellow citizens should be able to vote on the imposition when they have not paid that imposition themselves.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not understand what I said, so I shall repeat it. I said that it would be abhorrent for those who set the council tax—and therefore place an imposition on their fellow citizens—not to pay the tax themselves. That is the basic principle, and it applies to a representative democracy. Public officials and elected representatives have a duty to show the way. They should not demand that others pay tax and refuse to pay it themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the hon. Member for Eastbourne is giving the Committee the impression that we are seeking to deprive people of their vote at a general election, a European election or a council election? That is not so. We are simply saying that, if their payment is in default, they cannot vote in council, which is a perfectly reasonable suggestion. Does my hon. Friend also agree that it should not take two months for any city or country treasurer to tell one of his elected councillors that his cheque has gone astray and that has has not paid his tax? That is the context of my earlier remark that two months is more than long enough; and 12 months would take the council into another financial year, totally negating the purpose of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and there is a strange contradiction in the party view of the Liberal Democrats. The hon. Gentleman is saying that his party supports the clause, but that the period of time is wrong—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not. I am against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the hon. Gentleman should have moved an amendment to delete the basic point. What he has done is to substitute 12 months for two months. That is not an argument about principle but a point about the time period. Yet the hon. Gentleman now claims that he is against the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My introductory remarks made it clear that the Liberal Democrats were opposed to the clause in any case but that the two month period was not workable. That is what we are presented with in Committee, so we sought to improve the Bill by extended the period to 12 months so that it would be more administratively convenient and fairer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very interesting. I shall ensure that our candidates up and down the land faced with Liberal Democrat candidates are made aware of the fact that the Liberal Democrats do not believe that there should be any penalty on any councillor who does not pay the council tax; that if a Liberal councillor refuses to pay the council tax, that that is fine by the party; and that such a councillor can continue voting to put the imposition on others to raise money for services for which he will not pay. That is a very interesting suggestion, and if that is the principle of the modern-day Liberal party, it is a pale shadow of the old Liberal party, which used to believe in responsibility going with rights. The hon. Gentleman does not believe that responsibility should go with the

rights of being a local authority representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene and put the record straight. I apologise to the Committee for having to do so repeatedly during the response. However, I said—and 	<i>Hansard</i> will show it—that there were sufficient safeguards in position in our society for people who have not met their financial dues. 	<i>Hansard</i> will demonstrate that that is how I suggested that people who had not met their financial dues should be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now seeking to wriggle, but the simple fact is that the Liberal Democrats are making it clear that they believe that councillors who fail to pay council tax should not be excluded, and should be allowed to continue to vote for the imposition to be imposed on other people. That is not a good principle of local government. The clause is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friend's would go further than the clause. Some would argue that those who do not pay their council tax should not be allowed to stand in local authority elections. I do not go that far. The clause is a suitable sensible compromise. I am glad that the Labour party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is perhaps slightly technical, but I am uncertain whether the wording would cover a councillor who may become unemployed and liable for a full rebate. However, it might well take two months for that rebate to be agreed. During that period, he may not have paid, having rightly said that as he was due for a rebate there was no point. Is the Minister certain that that situation could not arise under these clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlemen is stretching the point a bit. I listened to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) talking about councillors being unable to afford to pay. However, we give councillors attendance allowances which they claim for going to council meetings. The claims made by councillors, especially Labour party councillors, show that they are not slow in coming forward to claim large sums of money for attending council meetings and for meeting officers. If we told members of the public who pay the council tax that their councillors are not paying it and, what is more, are receiving attendance allowances for going to council meetings that would stick in the gullets of most people in this country. The hon. Gentleman talks about this being a bit of a liberty when he is speaking for .the liberty-takers. It is important for us to be aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is fair. If a councillor does not know that he is in arrears, under clause 104 that is a defence against the charge that is made. The clause is aimed at those who deliberately refuse to pay their council tax. Two months is long enough after a Bill is payable for a councillor to find out whether he has paid his council tax. The hon. Member for Eastbourne has admitted that although he has tabled an amendment to extend the time to 12 months, he does not really believe that there should be any bar whatsoever.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 336, in page 77, line 36, leave out 'to' and insert '2, 2A and'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 338, 339, 346 and 347.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments extend exemption from non-domestic rates for church administrative property to all offices and ancillary office property that is occupied by bodies that organise public religious worship. The amendments will apply to England, Wales and Scotland. The effect of the amendment is not confined to the established Church; it could benefit any body that organises public religious worship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Churches main committee suggested that the current exemption from rates for church administrative building is not as wide as it believes the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) promised that it would be in 1988. The exemption is now given to buildings, or parts of them, that one used for the administration of public religious worship. In addition, certain other buildings used for other activities connected with the organisation of public religious worship, such as the training of clergy, are also exempt at present. However, the administration of other activities—like social welfare and housing—is not covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having considered what was said in 1988, we have decided to extend the exemption to all office property of churches. The amount of rate yield at stake is relatively small—approximately £20,000—and the churches' bills are already reduced by charitable relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the definition of "churches". Presumably the definition for Scotland would be different to that for England.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the amendment is concerned with non-domestic rating, not with the community charge or the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

specify that use as being non-domestic and therefore liable to non-domestic rates? The domestic part of his property valuation would be reduced accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the case if it is agreed with the local valuation officer and the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a question of principle. The current rule is operated at a local level; there has been some complaint that not all dioceses and religions are treated the same across Great Britain. If we went through the next revaluation with the same rule, we could find different treatment between areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 336 and 338 deal with the commencement of the provisions dealing with the change in exemption, to make it the same as other amendments that deal with non-domestic rating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear about how to define churches, church buildings, and so on. For example, some churches claim to represent a religion but are recognised neither by the Inland Revenue or by the Secretary of State as being charitable bodies. Will anyone who says, "My building is a religious building," automatically be exempt under non-domestic rates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The old rating system applied to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my hon. Friends says that the old rating system applied to that but the same problems arose in certain circumstances. I can remember members of a certain sect in my constituency coming to me</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Militant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not Militant, I hasten to add. They would not come to me under any circumstances. Those brothers came to me because in England and Wales, although not in Scotland, their buildings were not being recognised as being for charitable purposes. They probably visited Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland too. They were not recognised as a religious body. Charitable status in England and Wales is different from charitable status in Scotland. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best. The situation is fairly clear in Scotland. The amendment which replaces part of schedule 13 sets it out pretty clearly. It says:
	<br><q><p>"(a) a building occupied by a religious body and used for the purpose of religious worship;</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) a church hall, chapel hall or similar premises used in connection with a building such as referred to in paragraph (a) above"</p></q>
In the case of England in schedule 5 to the 1988 Act places the religious worship are defined as follows:
	<br><q><p>"a hereditament is exempt to the extent that it is occupied by an organisation responsible for the conduct of public religious worship in a place falling within sub-paragraph 1(a) above".</p></q>
The amendment amends the Bill in a way that is well understood. We are not redefining "religious", "religious body" or a "place of public religious worship". I would be surprised if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) wanted to press the point further. It is well understood by the churches in Scotland, Wales and England and by the other organisations and religions that are recognised as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But with this Bill, for which we have sat late into the night three times a week, our thanks are far from perfunctory. The Committee could not have operated without the tremendous co-operation from the people who keep the House of Commons ticking at all times—the policemen and attendants in the Room, the Clerks who assist you, Sir Michael, and your colleagues, and the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff who have been under a great strain.

As the Bill covers England, Scotland and Wales, there have been many Scottish debates, and I hope that you, Sir Michael, will join us for the national drink of Scotland in a Committee Room nearby as a token of our thanks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I think that all hon. Members who have served on the Committee feel that it has been a somewhat difficult experience, as the Minister implicitly conceded. However, speaking only for myself, it was also a surprisingly enjoyable one. I confess that sometimes at 1.59 in the morning the experience was something less than enjoyable, but overall our proceedings have left me with positive memories. Opposition Members may not feel that we have achieved as much as we should have liked, but the sense of enjoyment that has pervaded the Committee owes a great deal to the people whom the Minister has already identified and thanked.

In addition to the policeman and the attendants, I wish particularly to single out the Clerks—Mr. Frank Cranmer and Mr. Matthew Hamlyn—who have been extremely helpful, especially to those of us who tabled more amendments than others and needed guidance on that score. Rightly, the Minister singled out the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff, and his tribute to his and to other officials was entirely deserved. We marvelled at the frequency and speed with which large numbers of pieces of paper were passed when the need arose. We look forward to being served with similar efficiency.

I echo the Minister's remarks about members of the Committee and I pay particular tribute to my hon. Friends on both the Front and Back Benches. They brought to the Committee a truly bewildering range of expertise, commitment and good humour, which greatly aided our proceedings. There are also all the faithful people who tended to sit unnoticed in the Public Gallery as representatives of the outside bodies that took an interest in the Committee and whose advice was so valuable to us throughout our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Sir Michael, I thank you for the unfailing good humour and good sense with which you conducted the Committee's affairs. As with Mr. Leadbitter this morning, we felt that if this is the last Committee that you chair, it brings to a fitting conclusion a distinguished period of service for which I have especially good reasons to be grateful. You will be aware of that, Sir Michael, as I believe that this is at least the third major Committee on which you and I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1006</span>
have served in our different capacities. Your guidance and supervision of this Committee has matched the high standards that you set elsewhere, and my vocabulary can provide no higher praise than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no final battles in politics and we live to fight another day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Sir Michael. With my customary brevity may I add my thanks to everyone? I wish you well if this proves to have been your last Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a singular capacity at present—I have managed to stop the clock. I thank the Committee for the kind words that were spoken by the Minister and the hon. Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is the last major Committee that I shall have the pleasure of chairing I shall carry away happy memories. Our proceedings were conducted in a good-natured spirit which did not interfere with the quality of debate. Ideas are floating around about lengths of sittings and so on and if the powers that be were to look at the way in which this Committee conducted itself, they would have a good example to follow. I am extremely grateful to members of the Committee for the way in which they set about their task with such good nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, wish to add my thanks to all those who have helped but, above all, to my two Clerks who bore the brunt and heat of the day. I understand that two temperatures are running, but I shall not inquire into that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also offer my thanks to the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Leadbitter) who I believe has to enter hospital for a short while. I hope that he will soon be back with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>[Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: ["Hear, hear."] Thank you very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. This is the first time that the honour has fallen on me as an Opposition Back Bencher to say a few words on behalf of all Back Benchers in the Committee. We meet in secret and I am the shop steward. We give great consideration to the conduct of hon. Members during our debates and come to a conclusion by secret ballot, which the Government pay for through trade union legislation, and we make a number of awards to hon. Members .

I was able to pinch the notes that the Minister was given by civil servants in the past few weeks and they fall into about 10 categories. They include: "Dear Minister, you're on your own, pal", "It's your baby, sir", "Offer to write him or her a letter", "Abuse the hon. Member", "Tell the hon. Member you're astonished that he can ask such a silly question", "The Under-Secretary: talk about consultations going well."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
