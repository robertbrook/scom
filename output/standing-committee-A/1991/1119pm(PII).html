	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before this part of the sitting started, the Minister came up to me and said, "Ah, Harry, you were in full flood". That sounded all right until I realised that I was in the gents. Before dinner, I was trying to deal with the amendment in the calm and rational way in which I always approach such matters. Indeed, my wife, who is more spiritually inclined than I am, would say, "My karma has run over your dogma." I suppose that I was trying to run over the Government's dogma on the poll tax and the council tax, particularly in regard to keeping the 20 per cent, minimum charge. If ever there were a case for the unelectable supporting the uncollectable, this is it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was quoting the report of the advisers to the Department of the Enviroment, CSL. The Minister referred to the same report and used that as a basis for saying the everything was going well in relation to the software and other problems involved in getting the council tax ready. That is not so. Indeed, CSL's report makes that clear. It says:
	<br><q><p>"Approximately 75 per cent, of authorities in the sample have said that they have backlogs in one or more of the areas of Community Charge register maintenance, recovery or benefits. Although efforts are being made by these authorities to clear the backlogs, authorities have indicated that they cannot foresee the work being up to date before 31 March 1993."</p></q>
The council tax is due to be implemented the following day. The report continues:
	<br><q><p>"As a result they will be unable to free existing resources for the Council Tax implementation, with the result that additional resources will be required in the short term. It is essential that backlogs are cleared prior to Council Tax systems going live."</p></q>
All the evidence points to that not happening. When officials from local authority associations and from the Department of the Environment met as recently as 18 November, CSL was quoted as saying:
	<br><q><p>"Backlogs of poll tax will knock council tax over if anything will."</p></q>
CSL went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"Also, the majority of authorities are experiencing difficulty in collecting Community Charge. Authorities feel that with the abolition of Community Charge the problems of collection and recovery will increase, creating an additional workload which will prevent existing resources being available for implementation."</p></q>
That is a long way from the rosy picture painted by the Minister. Those backlogs will increase because many people feel that the poll tax is finished. The Government will be spreading that message in the period up to the general election in the hope of nullifying the poll tax as an election issue. That will create problems. With their collection difficulties, councils cannot put all their resources into properly implementing the council tax on 1 April 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
CSL says in its report that only 54 per cent, of the authorities that its representatives visited had sufficient mainframe capacity. Therefore, 46 per cent, did not. CSL stated:
	<br><q><p>"33 per cent, stated they would require additional capacity, as they were running their mainframe at close to maximum capacity and the impact of running Council Tax on the same mainframe would cause severe performance degradation for all systems."</p></q>
CSL pointed out severe problems and the Minister is misleading the Committee if he claims that they would not lead to backlogs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is correct; Parliament should have a contingency plan if the measure cannot be implemented on time. I want the poll tax to cease by 31 March 1993. If the Government had moved more quickly, we could have got rid of it by 31 March 1991 and put a new system in place, but they dragged their feet. I hope that the Minister will explain how he will surmount the serious problem of the backlogs that will inevitably build up. How much cash will he give to local authorities for their mainframes and computer software to deal with the problems to which CSL referred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was right to refer to discounts as complex and difficult to operate and perhaps they should be delayed. They are a particular difficulty in London where it is estimated that about 40 per cent, of council tax payers will be eligible for them. However, people move around frequently in London. In my constituency, young people and students move apace from home to home. It would be better to sort out those problems through a rebate system or a transitional arrangement rather than by discounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of the amendment is the 20 per cent, minimum charge. I should have preferred that charge to go this year, but it must go in the next financial year. Apart from some Conservative Members, there is no support for it from the professional organisations or the local authority officers who must deal with the poll tax and council tax in my area, and that is echoed throughout the country. There is an enormous crisis in the poll tax benefits sections of local authorities because so much time is taken up in working out the claims of people on 20 per cent. If those claims were erased from the workload, the sections could concentrate on other people with smaller rebates. Because of the time spent on working out the claims of the 20 percenters, there are longer and longer delays in dealing with other people's rebates. That has created great concern as well as a morale problem in those sections. People come to my surgeries or telephone me saying, "We do not know where we are with the poll tax because our benefit has not been sorted out."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's views on the collection of the poll tax. However, the amendment deals with the collection of the council tax. Will the hon. Gentleman explain how he can deny the opportunity of having a 25 per cent, rebate in the first year of the council tax to the same group of people whose 20 per cent. contribution to the poll tax he is suggesting should be forgone? The two things are clearly inconsistent. It is difficult for hon. Members to support the hon. Gentleman's view in the light of his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the rebate, indeed the Government have supported the 100 per cent, rebate on the council tax. I just want to bring that rebate forward and apply it to the poll tax. That should have been done last
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
year. I think that the hon. Gentleman was referring to the discount system. That would be a contingency plan as provided for in the amendment.The purpose of our probing amendment is to discover what will happen if the timetable does not work, as appears likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount system is complex and could be delayed. I said that the problems of single people, could be picked up within the existing rebate system or through the transitional arrangements. That would also give us more time to consider the operation of the discount system on a fairer basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a crisis in relation to poll tax benefit for many of my constituents and for people throughout the country. That is borne out by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. In a briefing for Second Reading, NACAB states:
	<br><q><p>"The CAB Service welcomes the decision that people on income support will receive a 100 per cent, rebate entitlement under the Council Tax. The cost of collecting these often low figures is disproportionately high and financially inefficient. The Audit Commission has found that it costs £15 to collect £6 of community charge from people on income support. The administration needed ties up valuable time and resources that could be better spent in working out more humane and effective enforcement procedures against those with larger arrears. CAB evidence indicates that clients are finding it increasingly difficult to manage on present levels of benefit. Meeting their basic needs such as food, clothing, and heating more often than not means that they are unable to meet the 20 per cent, payment in full. The CAB Service therefore urges that 100 per cent, rebates are granted for those on income support from April 1993."</p></q>
NACAB describes two cases showing the hardships involved in meeting the 20 per cent, contribution. It says:
	<br><q><p>"A CAB in west London reports a client who after deductions for weekly fuel charges and community charge has only £14.84 to live on."</p></q>
I should like to see hon. Members—or anybody—live on £14.84 a week, especially with the high cost of living in London—recently reported as the second highest among EC countries. Fares are particularly high. NACAB gives another example:
	<br><q><p>"A CAB in Essex reports a case of a client who suffered a severe mental breakdown as his income support was reduced to £19.50 because of direct payments and cannot afford a proper diet if he pays 20 per cent, of the commmunity charge."</p></q>
Those examples are repeated many times at my advice surgery and throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the poll tax was introduced, it was thought that the people who would suffer most would be those on low incomes who had to pay the full charge. That has not happened. Those people have suffered, but those who have had to pay 20 per cent, of the charge have suffered most because their incomes are a pittance and their living costs are high. That is what I have found among the people whom I have tried to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to one other meeting—that of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and other local authority associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is going very wide of the amendment. He said that he would like to say a few more words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to do so, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
I was referring to proposed subsection (1C) of the amendment, which relates to income support up to 100 per cent, of the amount of any council tax liability and having effect from 1 April 1993.1 support that, but I want the effective date to be even earlier and to apply to the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer briefly to the meeting which I mentioned and this will be my final substantive point on the matter. The meeting was held with the Secretary of State on 24 September. A paper was produced on the problems of collecting and enforcing the poll tax. The purpose of the paper was to argue for an end to the 20 per cent, contribution from students and those on income support with effect from April 1992, not April 1993 as proposed. The paper stated that that would enable collection and enforcement resources to be better used towards the collection of larger outstanding amounts. The Audit Commission supported that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the ending of the 20 per cent, contribution would be expensive as it amounted to a significant sum—ut the Audit Commission pointed out that the cost was significant—two-and-a-half times more than was collected. That first point from the Minister was a rather poor one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then threw out a few red herrings. He said that politics had affected the collection rate and that authorities whose councillors had not paid the poll tax had brought trouble on themselves. The Minister repeated that point this evening, but there is no evidence of any such correlation. Most of the authorities that have had trouble with collection have poor residents who cannot afford to pay. The evidence suggests a clearer correlation of that feature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister drew attention to the fact that authorities with a poor performance on rent collection had a poor performance on poll tax collection. That was a repetition of the previous point: it is an indicator of the wealth of the people in that area. Another problem with high rents occurs when the Department of Social Security does not pay its proportion because of its heavy workload, and the difficulty worsens when rents increase. In my constituency, there will be an increase of £4·50 for no purpose whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AMA stated that there were practical problems with attachment orders by courts and because of the turnover of students. The argument was that it was costly to pursue large numbers of people for small amounts. It was thought that in future it would be better to secure larger amounts. It was argued that the 20 per cent, contribution should apply from April 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of District Councils, again Conservative controlled, also said that collecting the 20 per cent, contribution was very uneconomical—
	<br><q><p>"collecting small amounts was not business-like" was the phrase that the ADC used.</p></q>
Then the London Boroughs Association weighed in, stating that while in some authorities the collection and enforcement of poll tax might have been made more difficult by the views of councillors and Members of Parliament, the vast majority, even Conservative controlled—authorities, had had difficulties. That resulted in a politically difficult "other adjustments" figure, which even Tory authorities had to charge their own residents. All those Conservative controlled authorities argue in favour of getting rid of the 20 per cent, minimum charge as early as possible. That makes sense for reasons that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
That policy would help councils to implement the tax on time without unnecessary administrative difficulties, and would help to get the poll tax benefit system working now. All the professional associations support that. Finally, and this is an important point, my constituents support it. I suspect that constituents of most hon. Members also support it. Many of those who suffer face the tax with fear and dread, simply because they do not have the money to pay. The Government should see sense and scrap their proposed 20 per cent. minimum charge for next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to explain briefly why I and many of my hon. Friends find the Minister's reply unsatisfactory, and consequently why we intend to press for a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I moved the amendment, I concluded by posing three questions, which I hoped that the Minister would answer. Those questions were: what assessment did he make of he chances of meeting the 1 April 1993 deadline; what contingency arrangements did he have in mind if the deadline were not met; and why could not the abolition of the 20 per cent, contribution rule apply from the beginning of the next financial year rather than from 1993 onwards. The Minister made no attempt to answer the third question. We still have not been told why that rule cannot be rescinded straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first question of assessment, on the basis of foreseeing the sort of reply that might have been expected, I intended to reply by urging the Minister not to weary the Committee with bluster and bombast. Instead, we received no concession even that there might be a problem. He said simply that any fear on that score was absolute nonsense. That is a silly remark to offer the Committee, and it is even sillier when it is addressed to the local government world outside the House. People in local government know the problems perfectly well and are conscious of the difficulties that they face. They will be saddened by the fact that the Minister has made no recognition of their problems; when they need the comfort of knowing that the Government are aware of these problems and are thinking of them. They have had nothing from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not even consider the second question about contingency plans. By definition, since the whole Idea of delay is nonsense, the Minister had no need of contingency plans. That is extremely depressing. All we heard from the Minister was the blithe assertion that the discount scheme was administratively simple, which contradicts virtually all the evidence from independent bodies such as the Audit Commission and the views set out in a leading article in the 	<i>Local Government Chronicle.</i> Independent sources agree that what the Minister said is simply not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount system is extraordinarily complicated and will create most of the problems that may delay the implementation of the tax. We saw something of the Minister's reluctance to reason through what he has said when he asserted, in virtually the same breath, that the discounts would be straightforward, and that "most" households would pay a standard bill. He seems to ignore the fact that, according to the Audit Commission's figures, 7 million households—33 per cent. of the total—are single households and will not therefore pay a standard bill. Moreover, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) said, some parts of the country have a much higher proportion of single households. In London, almost
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
certainly 40 per cent, of households are single, and in some London Boroughs almost 50 per cent. of households are single.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The composition of single-person households will change regularly on a day-by-day basis, and the members of those households will also change their status with almost equal frequency. One therefore begins to appreciate some of the complexities that are involved. However, the Minister has said that the matter will be administratively simple and that nothing needs to be taken into account, because any fears about delays are absolute nonsense. I find that very depressing. We have here all the makings of yet another disaster. Some veteran Conservative Members must surely know what they are heading into, because they have seen it before with the poll tax, and they have heard exactly the same blithe assurances and the same arrogant dismissal of concerns. Surely they will not swallow it all again. However, I fear that that is what we are facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the Minister's performance dispiriting and, as a mark of my displeasure at the fact that he has treated neither the Committee nor local government with sufficient seriousness, I invite my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. You said "2 o'clock". I had assumed that we were about to have an open-ended sitting. I have heard nothing to the contrary. The timetable motion does not mention our sitting ending at 2 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to refer to that point. The intention to finish our proceedings at 2 o'clock has been voiced by various Conservative and Opposition Members. I accept that that depends entirely on an appropriate motion. If it appears that such a time is unjustified, naturally I shall reconsider my decision. As long as it is apparent that we shall end the sitting at 2 o'clock, I propose to continue our proceedings without a tea break.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 50 refers to the nuts of the problem of how to raise local taxation. I have listened for some hours to the speeches of Front Benchers, and it is fairly obvious that, no matter how long people take to express their views, the thought whether a property tax can ever be fair is left in everyone's mind. Indeed, the Minister has claimed that taxes on people's homes are unfair and that property values bear little relation to people's ability to pay. That statement will haunt him for a long time. The date of 19 October 1990 is significant as it was the day after I was elected to the House. However, the Minister's statement was even more significant than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that members of the Committee have referred to the ability to pay. Commenting on discounts and on the number of people who lived in a particular house, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said, "It depends on a person's income." That was revealing. In other words, it depends on what a person must pay to discharge his responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is not here—I am not taking advantage of his absence. The hon. Gentleman said that, when he visited Kincardine, no one asked him about the council tax. I made a note of that comment because, when I visited Kincardine, a gentleman opened the door of the first bungalow I called at, and said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Ah, David Bellotti".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was very perceptive. I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman. Only when I left did that man recognise me, and his question was—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] All this is the jealousy of hon. Members who have not had the advantage of winning a by-election. Those present who have won one know that media attention during by-elections is much greater than generally. That is a disadvantage as well as an advantage. It means that, unfortunately, a person is recognised instantly throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gentleman in the bungalow said, "Yes, I am considering voting for you. I have always voted Conservative, but I have a question." Those of us who canvass regularly know that at that point one's heart sinks because one wonders what the question will be, especially if one is a long way from home, as I was—I could not have been much further away. The question from the first person to whom I spoke on a doorstep in Kincardine was, "Can you explain what the council tax will be about?" I thought that question was wonderful because the council tax was the only thing that I knew anything about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not resist the temptation to give the hon. Member more advantage at my expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman was canvassing in the Kincardine and Deeside by-election and that he admits openly that he knew nothing about Foresterhill hospital and opting-out issues and nothing about the Gordon Highlanders and the possible amalgamation of Scottish regiments, although they were the two major issues in that by-election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. If I am here as long as I hope, no doubt my attitudes and abilities will alter. I have been here only a year, so I am extremely modest and humble, unlike some hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I beg the Committee to settle down so that we may proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My story has a point. The gentleman is single and retired, he lives alone and he has suffered greatly because of the rates. When the poll tax was introduced, he benefited considerably. He is now disturbed at the effect on his reducing income, year by year, of having to pay the council tax. Thousands of people in each constituency will be adversely affected by the council tax. The Government have not assessed how many people will be affected. I have shown that this was an issue in Kincardine because the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that no one had raised it. I remind the Committee of the election result, which showed clearly that people are worried about a range of issues, including the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman tell us that his constituent will lose because of the abolition of the poll tax. We realise that the hon. Gentleman is relatively new to Parliament, but is he setting out the Liberal Democrats' view that somehow the abolition of the poll tax will be a disaster for his constituents? If so, that is something new, even by his party's standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Millions of people will lose after the abolition of the poll tax—there is no doubt about that. Millions gained by it, and millions lost. We seek to make the tax more fair and our amendment would lead in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Goverment are fooling themselves if they have not assessed the numbers of people—there are millions—who will lose as a result of the council tax. They are the people in London and the south-east especially. In my constituency, there will be far more losers than gainers. Hon. Members will have assessed the position in their constituencies. In Eastbourne, the council tax is good news for me personally, but it is not good news for others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's little story explains why the Labour party came fourth in that by-election, but he did not say that the real lesson of his story is that the constituent did not mention, and the hon. Gentleman kept quiet about, the Liberal Democrats' policy, which is to introduce a local income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a nice trade in statistical information. It is also true to say that, in the ward in East Sussex, in which I am a county councillor, the Conservative party came fourth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can now return to the amendment rather than have historical records about by-elections. I, too, won a by-election and I should hate to go through all that again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to you, Sir Michael, and I hope that we can move on to the content of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We proposed the amendment because we concluded that property tax is unfair. It is an unfair basis on which to start. The complicated tangle evident in the Committee and on the Floor of the House on Second Reading clearly demonstrates that, no matter what is done with a property tax, it cannot be turned into a fair taxation system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is silly to proceed further without seriously considering the one alternative which works in so many other countries and which is available to this country should we wish to proceed in that way. I refer, of course, to local income tax. Local income tax is extremely easy to collect because we already have a national taxation system—Inland Revenue, through which deductions can be made. The tax is cheap to administer because it is a percentage that is bolted on to the current national taxation rate. Above all, it is related to the ability to pay—only those who pay taxes would pay a local income tax. People on income support, students and others who do not pay any current national tax would not pay local tax. Clearly the tax would be related to the ability to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said "bolted on". How much local income tax would be "bolted on" to income tax to raise sufficient revenue for what he wants to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention because it allows me to say that the national standard rate would be approximately 3.3 per cent. We have published details— they are publicly available—of the actual rates that would have been in place in every constituency this year had a local income tax been introduced. If the hon. Gentleman wants to know about a specific area, I can make that information available later.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
At least the local income tax has been well thought through—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It has been well thought through. In 1976, the Liberal party put this policy to the Layfield Committee. For 15 years, it has been the policy of my colleagues in the Liberal party and other people have begun to examine it as a possible way forward. In view of present circumstances, many professional associations now say that the Government should seriously consider a local income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to demonstrate that local income tax has not just arrived as a response to present circumstances. The policy has been proposed for a least 15 years. It works in many other countries. I was asked about them earlier. Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Japan, Belgium, Italy, Greece, among many others, have in place local income taxes that actually work. It is not reasonable to refute such a system on the ground that it does not work; plainly, it works elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several observations can be made about local income tax, but I have one specific question. I asked it on Second Reading and the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats seemed unable to answer it. As I understand it, the rate of local income tax that would be needed in, for example, the London borough of Camden would be very high indeed. One suggestion was that it would be higher than the standard rate of income tax demanded nationally. If that is not so, no doubt the hon. Gentleman will tell me. If it is, what will be the consequences for the people of Camden? The measure has not been thought through; it is a typical Liberal Democrats policy. It sounds good, it sounds simple, but in reality it would not work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to be accused of not thinking through something that has been one's policy for such a long time. It is a matter of record that the council tax which we are discussing has been thought up only recently. Therefore, it is somewhat of a cheek to say that someone else's suggestion which has been debated and thought about for well over 15 years has not been thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other half of the question was really about what will happen in my area. There will always be local authorities which want to spend a lot more money. This is an issue of accountability. At the centre, we have to decide to whom those local authorities are accountable. My party is in no doubt that the people who are elected locally are accountable to the people who elected them, they are not accountable to the people in Westminster. Indeed, there are ways of ensuring that very high-spending authorities do not spend sums way beyond the imagination of the rest of us. That can be done by having a fair voting system in every local authority area so that the people who are elected only if they secure well over half the votes at an election. That would take care of most of the extreme councils. That must be part of the package of accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder what the hon. Gentleman's answer is to the criticism made by the Layfield committee. Let us take two boroughs of similar population. One has a very high rating base and the other is much worse off, with high unemployment levels and low pay. The better-off borough will draw in more money than its needs require and the poorer borough will draw in less than it requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is absolutely right. That issue was with us in the rates and in the poll tax. It will be with us in the council tax and it would be with us in a local income tax. There must be a form of equalisation. Those areas that create wealth must be prepared to share it with areas of high unemployment where only a small sum of money is reaped. Lower quality services must not be delivered just because a local community cannot raise enough funds to pay for its essential services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, can the hon. Gentleman explain how his accountability argument will operate? I am sorry to give a Scottish example. If the people in the Eastwood district had ½p in the pound put on local income tax, so many millions of pounds would be raised that Eastwood council would not know what to do with it, yet the tax rate would be low. However, next door, Renfrew district council, with its high level of unemployment could put l0p in the pound on its local income tax and it would not raise enough to meet its needs. There must be equalisation, but that would mean that the people of Renfrew were not really accountable because the people of Eastwood would be paying for their services. I can understand the need for equalisation grants, but I cannot understand how that can be made accountable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for that intervention because it gives me an opportunity to put more of our local income tax proposals before the Committee. I welcome the opportunity of going into such detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The equalisation process is not something that we see central Government undertaking. It would be undertaken by local authorities in concert. Ultimately one must decide whether to control all local authority actions from the centre or to give authorities the opportunity to serve their communities. There is no doubt about which is the right course. Since 1979, when I was first elected to a district council, the Government has gone in the opposite direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As someone who represents an area with a low income tax yield, may I put my first bid in? The hon. Gentleman is describing not a local income tax but an increase of 4p in the general rate of income tax. It is the same principle as that of some Conservative Members who want to increase VAT by 2.5 per cent, or 5 per cent, to pay for local government. It is the same concept, dressed up as a local income tax. It is a tax hike on a national scale and does not resolve the issues which we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on an important point. The difference between our proposals, which are related only to ability to pay, and those of the Labour party is that, under Labour's proposals, people on low incomes but with high value property will contribute more than their means will allow to local taxation. Such people would not be penalised under a local income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Several hon. Members 	<i>rose—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make progress. The Committee is making substantial progress because hon. Members are finally taking the matter seriously. The Government have only one reason for opposing a local income tax. The Secretary of State once said that it was because the Liberals had thought of it. He is not here to listen to his words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
A local income tax would be cheap to administer and easy to put in place. The good news for the Committee is that it could easily be in place by 1 April 1993 because most of the records needed are already available on computer. I challenge those who do not believe that to visit their local Inland Revenue offices and ask to see their own records. That would not breach confidentiality and they would be able to press a button and see their name, address and postal code appear on the screen. That is available now, throughout the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way because I know that that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Ministers could perform this task better than I can because they have the facts. The Inland Revenue is increasingly computerised, but its computer records do not necessarily include people's home addresses because it is the place of work that matters to the Inland Revenue. The tax office of all Members of Parliament is in Cardiff. Whether we live in Hamilton, in London or anywhere else is irrelevant. All that matters is that we work here and are taxed in Cardiff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely interesting point. Since I am a very new Member, in the past fortnight I had to complete a new tax form. The Cardiff tax office wrote to me at my Eastbourne address and, as the tax office had not been informed of that address, it must have picked it up in some way. I was told by Inland Revenue officers that the system across the United Kingdom is now fully computerised and that that took place a few years ago. I assure the Committee that I tested that information before mentioning it on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. I think that, for once, I concur with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) because if the Inland Revenue has the address, the key information on it is the postcode. My postcode, NG11, covers a large chunk of the constituency of the Secretary of State for Education and Science, a large chunk of the city of Nottingham and a small part of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Lester). I am afraid that one's home address and postcode does not reveal the district council to which the tax must be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention because I was about to pray in aid of my argument another place where all the postcodes are available—the local general post office. For some years it has been possible to go to the nearest main post office and look up an address and its postcode. That service has been available for rather longer than tax office records have been computerised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to ask about postcodes because I think that we all know how to find them. What would happen to business rates or to a local business tax under the proposed system, which, incidentally, I do not support? How would a business rate be calculated when the

present taxation system allows companies up to five years to submit their accounts and when their taxation is decided retrospectively? How would that system apply to the self-employed and to companies that go bankrupt or move out of an area during the course of the year? How would a local authority assess its likely tax base in order to plan its budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You referred to several matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share with the hon. Lady relative newness to Parliament, which means that, from time to time our phraseology is not exactly right, for which I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She speaks about the self-employed. Of course, they are required to pay their national taxes in a certain way, and their local income tax would be paid in exactly the same way. The Official Opposition believe that responsibility for the collection of business rates should be returned to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warn hon. Members against drawing any conclusions about the way in which the tax system operates from the way in which their personal taxation is dealt with. Members of Parliament are treated as a race apart—as indeed we are—and there is a special tax code for us. Nothing that happens to us personally, whether to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) or to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti), is relevant to any other member of the human race. The computerisation system works neither in the way that the proposer of the amendment states, nor in the way that the hon. Member for Dagenham states. It works in a totally different way, which I shall unravel in enormous detail to keep the Opposition hard at work way beyond two o'clock so that we can claim our cocoa when we hear the first Opposition Member snore a little later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Earlier today, a Labour Front-Bench spokesman said that wherever there is a local income tax there is also a property tax. I know of examples of countries, some near, some not so near, that rely wholly on a local income tax to raise their local government finance. Sweden, Belgium and Italy are three fairly close examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great success at collecting tax is Italy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such sedentary interventions would be fair comments if we were not here, almost in the middle of the night, debating local government finance because the Government have been unable to cope with the problem and have inflicted the poll tax on the whole of the country. At least I am trying to put forward a local income tax, and I am prepared to answer every question that is thrown at me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If postal codes are used, the residents of London SW8 and SW4 would be less than chuffed at the hon. Gentleman's policy. Some of them are in the London borough of Wandsworth and others are in the London borough of Lambeth. What borough one is in makes quite a difference to what one ends up paying. When he says the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
system could come in tomorrow, could he explain how any local authority treasurer could estimate how much money he would get from one penny on local income tax, given that every individual's tax position and, therefore, his or her tax payment may change during the course of the year? Could he couple with that an answer to the question of what happens to a second home? Is a second home not taken into account under local income tax? If not, where is the fairness in that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, and I shall take the hon. Gentleman's last point first. There are obviously two possibilities for second homes. First they could not be taken into account, as the hon. Member mentioned. Secondly, one could consider charging as one would charge a business rate. That possibility is well worth exploring. People who can afford second homes often have an income sufficient for them to contribute towards local services. What is most important is that each individual contributes in the first instance to local taxation, according to his ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Judging by the issues that are being thrown at me this evening by Conservative Members, one would imagine that they had come forward with the perfect plan for local government finance. Every Tory Member knows that the council tax is being supported by the Government to get themselves out of the hole of the poll tax, not because there is a great conviction that this is the way forward for local government finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My first point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been so many interventions from a sedentary position and I try to deal with as many as possible. But even with my ability, I am afraid that I have entirely forgotten the hon. Gentleman's first point, and I shall not allow him to come back on it. Incidentally, Sir Michael, you may not have noticed, but behind you people have been arriving during my speech, so I obviously make things happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This local income tax is easy to collect, cheap to administer and it improves accountability. One overwhelming advantage is its fairness, because no one can deny that it is linked to the ability to pay. In addition, it is so much cheaper and easier to collect and administer than all the other options on offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to be unfair to Labour Members, but as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) was speaking, I could see them thinking, "We thought that the poll tax was bad until we heard the hon. Gentleman describe the local income tax." I think that labour Members would agree that the hon. Gentleman's display was reminiscent of a 	<i>Focus</i> newsletter: it looked quite good on the surface and it had all sorts of glossy bits, but when it came to answering questions, it did not connect. That is the trouble with what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats may well have been rather more consistent about their policy than either of the two major parties, but I should have thought that they could have used the past 15 years to find the answer to the simplest, most fundamental question. But they have not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of flaws in the local income tax proposed by the hon. Gentleman. It would not be easy to collect, as has been made clear. From the Liberal Democrats' figures, produced at the last general election, it appears that a staff nurse would pay substantially more, on

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
average, under a local income tax system than under the rates or the community charge. That point has not been answered. On what basis would people pay the local income tax? What would someone on average income pay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and myself, although made from different geographical and political perspectives, was basically the same. I want to know the answer to a very simple question, and I will give way to the hon. Member for Eastbourne if he wishes to intervene, because he promised to provide specific figures if asked. What would be the rate of local income tax in the London Borough of Camden, which is a high-spending local authority with a number of social needs? The hon. Gentleman does not look as if he intends to rise—but here he comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to confirm what I said earlier.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is even more typical of the Liberal Democrats. It means that we shall have the information after we have voted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that there are two sets of figures. I have put down parliamentary questions on the rate of income tax that would apply in each local authority in Scotland, although I have not done so for England and Wales. I do not necessarily rely on the Government's figures any more than I rely on the Liberal Democrats' figures, but the two sets differ greatly. In Glasgow, for instance, the Government's rate, even with the reduction of £140, worked out at 7½p in the pound, whereas the Liberal Democrats' figure was 3½p in the pound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The problem is that the Liberal Democrats propose a very complex system. The difference between the two neighbouring London boroughs of Barnet and Camden is that in Barnet, the local income tax would be a quarter of the rate paid in Camden—according to Liberal Democrat figures. Would the inhabitants of Camden choose to stay there or would they move on the basis of those figures. How can there be a fair, equitable and reasonable system—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. The leaders of Camden and Barnet will meet and make a deal. No one will then have to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always knew that the hon. Gentleman could solve such matters.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest anyone believes that such crazy occurrences happen only in London, I ask my hon. Friend, who knows my part of the country well, to confirm that there are three constituencies in the city of Nottingham, which has a Labour-controlled council. In the surrounding boroughs, three constituencies correspond to three district councils, which are all Tory. In the city of Nottingham, 19,000 people are unemployed; total unemployment in the three surrounding boroughs is about 5,000. Under the Liberal Democrat system, the tax base would be so different, that the city would have a tax level that was four times that of the boroughs. If, as the Liberal Democrats claim, there would be equalisation, and everyone paid the same amount, what would be the point of a local income tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. If adopted, the Liberal Democrat plan would be a disaster. The hon. Member for Eastbourne did not have the courtesy to tell the Committee that the Liberal Democrats' document states plainly that they intend to reduce external finance for local councils. Bills would be higher, however they were shared out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We also propose to reduce national taxation. If central Government pay local authorities less, it is clearly possible to reduce national taxation by the same sum of money.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the explanation given by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has hit the nail on the head. The Liberal Democrats propose a chaotic system, which would be an administrative nightmare for local authorities and a national economic disaster, because it would increase marginal rates. The hon. Member for Eastbourne claims vaguely that the Liberal Democrats would reduce taxation rates by giving local authorities less money. I do not believe that, because it is not inherent in the rest of the proposal. The Liberal Democrats may well have supported the idea for 15 years. They should look at it again and then give us endless amusement on some other night when we examine once again their silly proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Mozart's bicentenary year, not Richard Strauss's, although I was inclined to think it might have been the latter's. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) does not have long, blonde hair down to his waist, nor is he naked, nor does he have blue eyes; none the less he reminded me significantly of the Lorelei, who sat on a rock and enticed seamen to dash their brains against the rock. The Liberal Democrats offer that same enticement with their local income tax. Their siren voices lure us ever on in a dreamlike world, where everything perfect will be granted—but in actual fact local income tax would prove a catastrophe.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain why. The first siren comment was "This can come in tomorrow." Of course it cannot: that is utter nonsense. The Inland Revenue computer system—I do not intend to move into injury time—runs on independent records for every individual who pays tax. That was brought in by a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer when he introduced accountability for income tax for married women. Before then there was no individual record for every person. By introducing that tax he individualised the records; he gave married women their own individual record on the computerised Inland Revenue system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what the Opposition spokesman has said, the system has been fully computerised at vast cost, enormous effort and great ingenuity. It is now up and running. Of course it can be altered, but not tomorrow. It would take a minimum of two or three years, but it could be done. However, it would cost a lost of money and would take at least several years. So let us discard that idea and leave it with die Lorelei. That is a Liberal tomorrow, not a Conservative one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we should remember that the Liberal heyday was at the height of the industrial revolution. We can recall that easily, because it was suggested that the system could be bolted on. Little is bolted on these days—certainly not a sophisticated electronic computerised system. There would be no bolting on but a complete revamp of a highly complex, modern system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Initially, I liked the enticement that a local income tax would be paid only by those who earn until I realised with a shock of unhappiness that that delineates two classes of people in the United Kingdom. That involves infinitely more than the sane and sensible system put forward by the Government. We should be divided for ever into the genuine haves and the genuine have-nots. Those who earn, pay, contribute and are civic citizens of renown would be the good guys; those who were not earning would be the discards—the outcasts of the system—who could not hold up their heads and say that they paid even a tiny fraction into the local community system. I cannot support a system that so clearly is aimed at creating two classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The equalisation idea sounded marvellously dramatic, fair, proper and liberal—just the sentiments we all should feel. Equalisation means that everything should be spread around in a perfect world, until we remember that the council is only an enabling device to give local councils authority over their own fate. Under the current system, which everyone likes and endorses—certainly those on our side of the fence—85 per cent, of funding already comes from central Government through taxation and value added tax. In itself, that is a near complete equalisation system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system relies on the assumption that the same quality of roads, education and social services must apply throughout the United Kingdom. That, surely, is the concept of SSAs. We may argue from now until eternity that our particular constituencies do not get enough from the SSA system, but that is another matter. The equalisation issue is a pipedream because the present system nearly provides that already; only 15 per cent, is on the table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall support my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, in saying—if he made such a statement—that there should be no local income tax because the Liberal Democrats thought of it, by relating a nice story about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
Kincardine and Deeside by-election, which I picked up in a newspaper today and which shows who are the real gentlemen in Scotland. I understand that the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has an enthusiastic public relations person—not a lady or a gentleman, but a person—who arranged for all media telephone calls to be channelled up to him on by-election night. But, lo and behold, she gave out the wrong number and when she dialled it she discovered a most courteous gentleman at the other end who assured her that, irrespective of concern for his own sleep, he would transfer immediately any calls that came throughout the night for the right hon. Member for Yeovil. That gentleman was my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland. The true gentlemen in Scotland are Conservative Ministers. I rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that it was not the Secretary of State for Scotland, but the man who would like to be Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a proper intervention. The hon. Gentleman is incorrect, as the Labour party usually is in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get my information from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My colleagues have already demolished much of the argument for a local income tax and, as the hour is getting late, I do not want to speak at length. However, I want to touch on one aspect of the tax which has not been raised so far. The tax is flawed because it does not carry a sufficiently high profile. The old argument about the rates was always that one paid them in anger whereas one paid income tax with regret because that was not so noticeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From everything that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) said, I asume that he would want greater accountability at least. For that to happen, people must recognise that they are paying more, or less, to credit, or debit, the relevant local authority. The system that the Liberal Democrats now propose, after 15 years, specifically links the tax to a coding, but people will not have the same identification with that as with a bill from their local authority that requires them to pay X pounds. I urge the hon. Gentleman's party to spend another 15 years trying to find a way to make its proposals carry that high profile because, without it, that tax does not have the central aspect of a local tax that everyone on either side of the political divide should seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the reception given to his remarks this evening, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) must conclude that talking to the Secretary of State about his party's proposals has not done much good. It is an advantage of a minor party—an advantage that the Liberal Democrats often try to exploit—that its proposals are not subject to the same scrutiny as those of the major parties. The hon. Gentleman may be forgiven for feeling that he has been picked on, but it must be an unusual experience for him to have his proposals examined in detail. As a consequence, many grave difficulties have arisen. I have no wish to prolong the debate, but I wish to give some of the reasons why we would find it impossible to support the amendments.

In any well-constructed tax system, it is wrong to load too great a burden on to one form of taxation. If income tax had to bear the burden of financing local government as well as the other services that it finances, it would create a dangerously unbalanced tax system. It is also a dangerous proposal for local government. If local government were to raise that most sensitive of all tax liabilities—the marginal rate of income tax—those who wish local government no good, which includes most Conservative Members, would find local government an easy target. Government who wished to centralise control over local government could find no easier way of doing it than simply to take over a local income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) that the easy assumptions about how quickly the proposals could be implemented are wide of the mark. If it were able to work at all, it would be a very complicated system that would take a great deal of preparation. It would be a recipe for retaining the poll-tax for many years yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a supposition that what is being proposed can be truly described as a local income tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) was right when she said that it is not a local income tax at all. What is being proposed, in addition to the other increases in the national rate of income tax proposed by the liberal Democrats, is a further 3p or 4p on the national rate. It would have to be applied across the board, without discriminating between local authority areas. To make it local, or appear to be local, at the end of the year a calculation would have to be made and a rebate paid or a supplementary bill sent out. If that were done inaccurately, it would be unworkable. If it were done accurately and most authorities spent roughly what they had received from the standard increase, the administrative cost of sending out all the rebates or supplementary bills and getting the money in or paying it out would far outweigh the revenue that would be gained. It is a hopeless system from an administrative viewpoint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a practical example of what such re-billing would cost authorities. The Minister of State poll-tax capped my local authority this year and it had to spend nearly £1 million re-billing people. That shows how expensive a local income tax system would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The example that he gives parallels what would be required as a matter of course of every local authority. The Audit Commission would go crazy. If it is worried about the 20 per cent, contribution rule and how much that costs in revenue compared with what is gained, imagine what it would say about the Liberal Democrats' system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further problem would arise. Any slight disagreement between local government's and central Government's calculations, which is a problem with the poll tax and will be a problem with the council tax, would be enormous under the local income tax system. The gearing on a reasonable assumption, could be about 40:1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has made a calculation. I do not claim for it the exactitude that we have applied to our fair rates proposals, but we calculate that the average local income tax bill for two people on average weekly wages across the country would be £883. That is based on assumptions that are favourable to the Liberal Democrats' proposals. Many households in better-off parts of the country would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
paying four-figure sums in supplementary income tax bills. It would not be an inexpensive tax and would add substantially to the income tax burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is only part of the picture. If the promise of the Liberal Democrats' financial spokesperson was implemented, at least another 1p and possibly 2p would be required for their education proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I referred earlier to the Liberal Democrats' proposal to increase the standard income tax rate. The hon. Member for Eastbourne conceded that there would be a reduction in central Government grant that would push bills up even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite frequent Liberal Democrat claims as to how popular their proposals are, every opinion poll of which I am aware has placed a local income tax low down in the range of options that people would choose, if allowed a choice. I am glad to say that fair rates always come top and the poll tax, the council tax and a local income tax scrabble around at the bottom of the pile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for a local income tax has been put fairly by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. It is the deficiencies of the proposal rather than his own deficiencies which have led to his being given a rough ride and an unwelcoming reception. Various objections have been raised and we need rely on only one or two of them to explain why we would not support the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate this evening on the Liberal Democrats' proposals for a local income tax has been fascinating. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that this is perhaps the first time that the Liberal Democrats have had their views on local government taxation subjected to parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said, the proposals appear fine, shiny and nice until one picks them up, and then they fall apart in one's hands—rather like the chair of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes)—and there is nothing left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not the first time the Liberal Democrats have had the opportunity to discuss their proposals—no, I am sorry, they were not the Liberal Democrats but the Social Democrats. The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) served on the Committee that considered the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987. That was four years ago— a fair part of the 15 years for which they have held the policy—and the explanations of the tax by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland were no better than those of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that interesting point. I confess that the 1987 debates do not figure in my bedside reading and I was not aware of the famous speeches by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask some important questions about the Liberal Democrats' proposals. Are they practical? Are they fair? What would be their effect? Are they simple, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) claimed? Would they bring accountability? What would be the mix between local income tax and national objectives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
It is worth starting by asking how they would work because, unless the practical questions are answered first, one cannot answer the questions of principle which the Liberal Democrats claim for their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken the trouble to read the Liberal Democrats' document "Local Income Tax: The Best Way". That states the Liberal Democrats' views on how their LIT proposals would work:
	<br><q><p>"a rate of LIT is determined locally … each district authority gives notice of the rate they set to the Inland Revenue, who collect the tax … collection happens like this: everyone, wherever they live, initially pays a uniform rate of LIT, for example 4 per cent at the end of each year taxpayer's actual liability is assessed depending on where they live and their overall taxable income … those living in areas where the LIT rate is below 4 per cent, get a refund, those living in areas with high LIT rates pay the difference".</p></q>
The Liberal Democrats' local income tax is only one strand of their proposals for local government reform, and the hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned only one or two of those proposals on finance. It is right that we should have on the record their proposals in their totality. The Liberal Democrats would reduce central Government financial support to local councils. They would abolish the power to cap local council spending. They would allow councils to allocate central Government funds between themselves. They would hand back to local councils the power to set business rates. They would also, an interesting suggestion that has not been made by any other party so far, allow councils to take on any functions compatible with their income and ability which their citizens wished them to take on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat policy is to transfer from central to local government a whole range of powers, some of which even the Labour party would not contemplate in its wildest dreams. But let us look more closely at the issue of fairness raised by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Not everyone pays income tax. Who are the non-payers and why do they pay nothing? Those who do not pay income tax escape it even though they benefit from local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some do not pay income tax because they have a low income. Others do not pay it because they have allowances to set against income—including mortgage interest relief or pension contributions; or, as the hon. Gentleman said, certain people escape United Kingdom residence for tax purposes. In certain London boroughs, that could result in a significant number of people exempt from local tax, irrespective of their wealth, even though they benefit from local services. A minority will thus bear a disproportionate burden of local council spending—a burden that would be increased by the transfer, which the Liberal Democrats propose, of a greater proportion of local government spending to the local income tax payer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that in England 15 per cent, of local government expenditure comes from the local taxpayer, and in Wales only 8 per cent. does. Therefore 85 per cent, in England and 92 per cent, in Wales comes from central Government taxation or from the business rate. The central Government taxpayers' contribution comes from a wide variety of taxes. Each citizen pays something towards the cost through VAT, excise duties and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mechanics and impact of local income tax would ensure that it was not fair to those required to pay it. How the hon. Member for Eastbourne can claim the system is simple. I do not know. As my hon. Friends have pointed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
out, there is nothing simple about the income tax system. It is far from simple and it raises far more questions than it answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system suggested by the Liberal Democrats is extraordinary. The hon. Member for Eastbourne says that the Inland Revenue could collect the tax, and it could. But the Inland Revenue would need to keep track of the whereabouts of the millions of individuals who pay income tax. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) pointed out, income tax is paid on the place of work, not on residence. The Inland Revenue could not easily cope with the administration of a local income tax because, as the hon. Gentleman said, most workers are registered according to where they work rather than where they live. A whole new machinery would have to be established and that would be expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne seems to be seeking a super community charge register with the names and addresses of 26 million people. Does the hon. Gentleman really believe that that will be cheap and simple to maintain and update? I do not think that anyone in the House, other than the Liberal Democrats, believes that such a system could be brought in on—and I quote—"1 April 1993".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crucial point is that once that system is operating, with 26 million names and addresses allied with Inland Revenue tax gathering information, the way will immediately open for it to merge with the benefits system. We will then really move into central Government control of a type and style that we have never experienced in the United Kingdom. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend confirm that this also lies at the heart of the Labour party's fair rates system? That is in the small print which should be read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that interesting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal party should be concerned about the freedom of the individual. The idea that the state will be compiling a bigger and bigger list of names and addresses to try to include everyone, and allying it with the benefits list, is not in line with earlier Liberal proposals about the freedom of the individual and not allowing state power to be increased. Those people who complained about the community charge register are hardly likely to be in favour of a super community charge register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to cover the point raised by the Minister and make one of my own. If the Government are suggesting that the introduction of a local income tax would add one name to the computerised records at the Inland Revenue, I hope the Minister will agree that the Government are mistaken. Clearly, a local income tax will be paid only by the people who are now paying income tax and who are already on the national computer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not realise that at present income tax is collected via a person's place of work. The Inland Revenue does not have the names and addresses of all 26 million people. It would be dangerous of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that the Government should collect on a giant register 26 million names and addresses, which might, perhaps, be allied with the benefits register. I say that not to make a great debating point but because the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
Liberal Democrats cannot claim to be the party that believes in Liberalism and support the idea of giving the state greater information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not jesting when I suggested that just because the names and addresses of Members of Parliament are on the Inland Revenue system they should not presume that the system has the names and addresses of everyone in the rest of the world. Hon. Members think that because we have created such complexity in our world everyone must be identified by their name and address. That is incorrect. The Minister is correct to say that we should be inviting the Inland Revenue to put alongside every record it holds a name and address that identifies where each person lives. If that were done, the doors would be opened to the merging of computer systems. At present that cannot be done because the social security and national insurance systems are based on names and addresses, but the Inland Revenue system is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes very persuasive points. When I heard the hon. Member for Eastbourne talk about computer lists and going into an office and having the button pressed, I remembered that about two years ago I went to the social security office in my constituency. I was told there exactly what the hon. Member for Eastbourne was told by the Inland Revenue office: "Press a button, Mr. Bennett, and the computer will come up with your name and address and how much you have paid." I duly pressed a button and up came an address that I had left seven years ago. It appeared that the Department was seven years behind with my national insurance contributions! If that is the way the computer system in the social security office works—I hasten to add that I have proof that I did make the payments over the seven years—I would not have the same faith in computers as the hon. Member for Eastbourne has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did not explain how the system would deal with changes in residence during a year. On average, people in Britain move every seven years. The system would have to cope with continual change to make sure that everyone who changed address registered the change with the Inland Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister square what he has just said, which is true, with the Government's proposals for the discount scheme, which will require a register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very simply. The local authority office will keep a list of those who wish to claim the discount. The onus is on those who claim the discounts. Self-interest will prompt claims, so there will be no difficulty about people not claiming the discount on the council tax. The Liberal Democrats' proposals, by contrast, are fatally flawed because they are based on glib assertions about the computer system.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats' proposals would need a regional income tax on top of the local council's local income tax. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Eastbourne did not mention the regional income in addition to the national income tax and the local authorities income tax. The Liberal Democrats have not thought the matter through. They talk about a system in which people receive a rebate at the end of the year or have to pay more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that in some years a single lump sum could be as high as the aggregate of the weekly amount paid during the year. People could be left facing huge bills, especially in the first year of operation. In areas with a highly mobile population, neither the local authority nor whoever allocates external finance would know what the local tax base was. People who would receive a rebate at the end of the year from their local council would, in effect, have given their local authority an interest-free loan during the course of the year. All those who had to pay more at the end of the year would suddenly receive a very large bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, in Greenwich, the local income tax would have been levied at a total of 14ip in the pound. If taxpayers had paid 5p in the pound, flat rate, during 1990–91, as the Liberal Democrats propose, those in Greenwich would have faced a demand for an extra and punitive 9·5 per cent, of their total gross annual income at the end of the financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No wonder the Liberal Democrats continually understate the likely local income tax rates. Someone in Greenwich earning £12,000 taxable income a year, which is about the average, would have been faced with a total bill of £640 during the year, and an extra bill for £1,218 at the end of March, almost twice as much again. That would cause crippling cash-flow problems for the council during the year and for the local income taxpayers at the end of the year. Is anyone, apart from Liberal Democrats, saying that that is a sensible way of collecting local income tax and local finance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) said, the structure of the Liberal Democrats proposals is deeply damaging for the self-employed because they pay a lump sum at the end of the year, which could present even greater difficulties. The person in Greenwich would have not only £1,218 to pay at the end of the year, but £600 that he would not have paid as PAYE during the course of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
year. Therefore, the average self-employed taxpayer in Greenwich would receive a bill in March for about £2,000. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) said, that system is not simple; nor is it an election winner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats' system does not seem to include a collection mechanism to catch this end-of-year lump sum. PAYE is not appropriate, as it may mean taking much or all of a month's income at source. So will bills be sent out? At what cost? By whom? We are entitled to ask such questions because the Liberal Democrats have posed so long as the party of moderation. The hon. Member for Eastbourne tells us that they have thought through this matter for 15 years, but he did not mention the mechanics of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Greenwich, the local income rate would be levied at 14½p. Local income tax would be high in other authorities such as Haringey, at 13·8p, Hammersmith and Fulham at 13·lp, Copeland at 9·2p, Wigan at 9·2p, Barnsley at 10p and, Bolsover at 10p. My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Mr. Amess) will be pleased that the rate in Basildon would be 9½p. In Stevenage, it would be 8·4p and in Scunthorpe 8·9p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine why I have the figures for Basildon and Wigan, but someone living in Basildon with a taxable income of £12,800 would have paid £1,221 in local income tax. Someone with a taxable income of £12,800 in Wigan would have paid £1,177. The bills are astronomical. A couple on average earnings in Greenwich would have paid about £3,500. Those figures are staggering and the Liberal Democrats did not mention them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats have issued some figures. The hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned the figure 3·3p.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. How dishonest can the Liberal Democrats be? Here is a classic example of them wishing to face each way. The figure of 3·3p is based on accepting the £140 reduction in the Budget in March and on local taxation staying at 15 per cent. of total local government spending. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends voted against the £140 and they want to increase the proportion of tax that is taken and collected by local authorities. How can the hon. Gentleman say that the average local income tax proposed by the Liberal Democrats will be 3·3p when he does not accept the basis of that figure? It is strange that his figures did not take account of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also true that those are post-rebate figures? The figure for local income tax assumes that central Government will continue to pay local authorities the same amount as before in rebates for the poor. However, local authorities have a statutory right to claim rebates for the poor from central Government in respect of local taxation, but there is no obligation for central Government to pay such rebates in relation to a local income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart again anticipates my next point. The figures quoted by the hon. Member for Eastbourne do not take account of the rebate scheme. All his figures are bogus and are designed to allow the hon. Gentleman to pretend that his constituents in Eastbourne would have an easy ride and be better off under such a system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
Eastbourne is a good illustration of the local income tax. The Liberal Democrats suggest that the present rate for Eastbourne would be 2·9p. We have shown that that figure is bogus. A man on the average taxable income of £13,900 would pay £403 while a married man working in London with an income of £29,000 would pay £870 in local income tax. The figures for Eastbourne put out by the Liberal Democrats on their bogus assumptions are false. If we consider the figures for Eastbourne on more realistic assumptions, based on the Liberal Democrats' vote against the £140 reduction, taking rebates into account and accepting that local authorities should raise more of their own money, the local income tax rate jumps to 7·5p and the average bill is £963 for each income tax payer. My hon. Friends would be pleased if the 	<i>Eastbourne Herald</i> were to obtain those figures and show people what the hon. Member for Eastbourne promises them. We can ensure that a letter giving those figures reaches Eastbourne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a rare opportunity to examine the Liberal Democrats' proposals in detail. The hon. Member for Eastbourne has been silent on the subject of how the local income tax would draw banks, building societies and companies into the administrative quagmire of the super community charge register. If the tax is to be fair, it must be levied on all taxable income. Banks and building societies would have to deduct local income tax from the interest paid on deposit accounts and pay it to the account holder's local authority. Companies would have to deduct local income tax from dividends paid on shares and pay it to the shareholder's local authority. The local income tax cannot ignore such income, which, for some people, is substantial. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow West (Mr. Hughes) made an important point about fiscal migration. He gave the examples of Barnet and Camden. People who could move would quickly do so into a borough with a higher local income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lower, not higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is late. A borough with a lower local income tax. I was testing whether my hon. Friends were listening. People, especially those on high incomes, would move to areas with low local income tax. That would reduce the tax base of the areas in which they used to live and high-spending authorities would suffer from a downward spiral of ever-lower amounts of tax being collected. Services could be cut and the poor, whom local income tax is supposed to help, would suffer. That is the effect of fiscal migration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact of life that the higher one's income, the more one can afford a tax accountant to help one to avoid paying tax? Under the schemes proposed by the Liberal Democrats, the very well off would be a burden on the very poor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a perceptive point. He is absolutely right. Apart from having greater freedom and mobility to purchase property and move elsewhere, those with money who are faced with high local income tax bills could employ accountants to find ways round any difficulties that they might face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In arguing about simplicity, the hon. Member for Eastbourne ignored the tax yield, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West said. Fiscal migration is a difficult problem but tax yield, especially for small local

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
authorities, could vary considerably with economic circumstances. Local government needs a steady and predictable source of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) said, how are local authorities to know the effect of 1p in the pound on income tax in their area? If it is to come from the local inland revenue, it would mean turning on its head the basis of the inland revenue system, which is at the place of work. Local authorities would need that information to set their local income tax rates in advance to avoid major adjustments at the end of the year. A local income tax system would create a huge potential for costly and embarrassing miscalculations. It would result in a chancellor of the exchequer, able to tax our income as he or she thought fit, in every town hall. Few people would agree with the suggestion that in addition to a Chancellor of the Exchequer in Downing Street there should be another 400 scattered across England, Wales, Scotland and, presumably, Northern Ireland, levying a second income tax. If the Liberal Democrats had their way and there were regional assemblies and national parliaments, there would be a third income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats made great play of accountability, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch referred. The Government believe that a local income tax would weaken accountability. There would be no clear link between the tax that people pay and the level of local authority spending. As my hon. Friend said, individuals would have to add up the weekly or monthly deductions from their salaries to find out how much their local authority cost them per year. That is hardly clear, compared with an annual rates, community charge or council tax bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local income tax would be a buoyant tax; the revenue that it raised would increase from year to year as incomes rose, without any need to change tax rates. Would that encourage accountability or merely reduce the restraints on local authority spending? The hon. Member for Eastbourne said nothing about buoyancy, which is important. By how much would the rate of local income tax vary? Would it go up in steps of one penny, a half-penny or one tenth of a penny? Unless it were the latter, the smallest increase or decrease in local income tax of 5p in the pound would mean 10 per cent, or 20 per cent. That would weaken accountability and be a recipe for high-spending councils to increase spending by excessive amounts each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the national situation. It is significant that the Liberal Democrats did not think about the position of national Government vis-a-vis local government in terms of running the national economy. That may be because it is more than 16 years since they had the opportunity to have any say in the running of the national economy and it is obviously a matter that does not stand very high with them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says, "the Lib-Lab pact." I was careful with my words. The Liberals did not have any opportunity to run the economy. They were given the substance of reality, but had no real power whatever in the Lib-Lab pact. They were sold a pup by Jim Callaghan and caught a cold in the 1979 general election as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The party is facing both ways on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw that interesting suggestion in one of the prints recently, but I shall leave it to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) to deal with it. I am in no position to defend his research assistant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does local income tax fit into the structure and objectives of national taxation? As the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, local and national taxes must complement each other. The local tax should not usurp the objectives of the national tax. Taken together, the national and local taxes should not bear too heavily on any one tax base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard nothing from the Liberal Democrats about that—indeed, they propose three forms of income tax. We have the right to ask Liberal Democrat Members some fundamental questions. Do they believe that Government are entitled to control the level of local government spending, within the framework of national economic policy? Do they believe that Governments have a right to say that local authorities cannot increase spending by more than a certain amount, or that Governments should be concerned about the public sector borrowing requirement? If the Liberals do not believe those things, I suggest that they look at the lessons of 1976, when the right Hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore), the then Secretary of State for the Environment, said that the party was over for local government and that it had to obey the International Monetary Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Liberal Democrats want to pretend that they have some say in the creation of forms of taxation, they have a duty to address those important questions of principle. I have not seen those questions addressed anywhere in their document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have reduced the basic rate of income tax from 33p to 25p in the pound and increased incentives for effort, enterprise and efficiency; the Liberal Democrats—at their peril—now propose to increase income tax by 5p, 6p or even l0p in the pound, for some people. Such a course would work against incentive and effort. Equally, it is not right that local government should be given the right to determine the redistribution of people's income—that is a duty that can be given only to national Government. The Liberal Democrats in their rush to find some kind of gimcrack alternative—[hon. Members: "A 15-year rush?] In the context of the history of their opposition, 15 years is but a grain in the sands of time. They should stop to ask themselves about the high redistributive effect of local income tax, an issue that they have not addressed in any of their discussion documents. They should remind themselves of what the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) wrote in "Liberator" in February 1984:
	<br><q><p>"All personal taxes are indirectly and ultimately a tax on wealth production." The hon. Member for Eastbourne has forgotten about that completely during this evening's debate.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is quoting the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti), does he recall his own comments during debates on local government finance? He said:
	<br><q><p>"The community charge is a fair tax and a reasonable charge to make on people, so we should support it."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 May 1989; Vol. 153, c. 911.]</p></q>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points arise from that. First, it is not difficult to remember those quotations because the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) used them in the Second Reading debate on the Local Government Finance Bill, last week. Secondly, the council tax is an acceptable compromise between a property tax and a personal tax; as a member of the Government, I am happy to argue the case for that sensible compromise. It is a pity that the Labour party is proposing a return to the discredited rating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) wants to swap quotations. I have one of the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside, when he was Under-Secretary of State for Wales. On 5 July 1974, he said:
	<br><q><p>"I would go further and call attention to the many anomalies inherent in the rating system."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 5 July 1974; Vol. 876, c. 848.]</p></q>
I could also quote the famous statement made by the Leader of the Opposition in the House in 1980. We could swap quotations all evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with two points that have not been addressed by the Liberal Democrats. First, their policies pay no heed to the effects of their proposals on business location decisions. We in Wales, in particular, feel strongly about that, because in recent years more 20 per cent, of all the inward investment in the United Kingdom has come to Wales, which has only 5 per cent, of the total population. If we were to have a system of local income tax, and high-spending councils impose high rates of local income tax, we would deter and drive away inward investment from the areas that need it most—on the whole, those with the lowest incomes. I am sorry that the Liberal Democrats did not consider that when they drew up their proposals. Nor did they consider that a Welsh assembly would add another layer of tax-raising powers to those of national and local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that very point, is it not significant that Sweden and Belgium, the two countries quoted by the Liberal Democrats as examples of those that use a system of local income tax, are notorious for the fact that properous and successful businessmen are driven out of them by high rates of national income tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It was also interesting that the hon. Member for Eastbourne cited Italy in support of his argument. No one believes that Italy is a model for any sort of tax collection. It seems strange that the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is the correct path for the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, I shall say something about the Liberal Democrats proposals for rate equalisation and the idea of transferring the burden of taxation to local authorities from central Government. They suggest some sort of cosy cartel of local authorities, which would have nothing to do with the Government; the Government would just hand over the money. The local authorities would get together in a spirit of reconciliation and consensus and divide up the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
cake, just as they did in the old days of the alliance in 1987, between the SDP and what were then the Social and Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) remarked whichever party had a majority on the local authority associations would immediately make sure that it benefitted from the equalisation to the detriment of the minority parties. So we cannot take much notice of the Liberal Democrats' proposals on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In additional, that seems to fly in the face of everything that has been done by Governments of both parties over the past 20 years. We have recognised that the national Government have a role in putting national money into local authorities through top-slicing of budgets, through the city challenge, currently under way, and by ensuring that areas in need get special assistance. Under the Liberal Democrats proposals, central Government would find that their grants had to be taken away and given to local authorities, and they could no longer help deprived areas suffering from high unemployment or from sudden closures of pits and factories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the reasons advanced during the debate, the Liberal Democrats should go back to the drawing board. It is not good enough for them to say that they have thought about it for 15 years and then, when they are asked a simple question about their proposals for second homes, to make the asinine suggestion that second home owners ought to pay the business rate on their property. That would be a shock to those of us who have modest second homes. Therefore, we should reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for the spirit in which they have entered into the debate. I shall not be able to provide such an opportunity every evening, but I was grateful for one of the earlier contributions when it was, at least, said that the Liberal Democratics had been consistent. I compare that to the council tax Bill. There is no consistency in a Government, who, having made such a tragic disaster of the poll tax, bring forward a council tax to be discussed in the way that it is being discussed and demand that a decision be taken in a short time so that the new Tax can be inflicted upon people after a general election. Any hon. Member who suggests that our proposals have not been thought through should ask himself whether his party proposals have been well-thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1976, the Layfield committee considered the idea of a local income tax and concluded that it was worthy of further investigation. It was one of the options that the committee put forward as a strong possibility for the funding of local government finance. If it concluded that then, our proposal is at least worthy of consideration by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many figures have been bandied about during the debate and I shall draw some to the Committee's attention to try to persuade hon. Members that the local income tax is still worthy of consideration. I should like to draw in support the Secretary of State. A number of speeches in the House, along with some made in Committee this evening, have suggested that very high rates of local income tax could be imposed. Indeed the figure of 10 per cent, has been mentioned in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this year, the Liberal Democrats put down a parliamentary question to the Secretary of State asking what the average rate of local income tax would be should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
our system be adopted. The answer, in 	<i>Hansard,</i> is "around 4 per cent.".: Our figure is 3·3 per cent. Therefore, frightening figures such as 10 per cent.—someone even mentioned 13 per cent.—are not only grossly unfair but are given by people who have not examined the Secretary of State's answer. One must be sensible about the figures and I hope that I have demonstrated that I am. Obviously, some rates are less than 3·3 per cent, and some are more, but 3·3 per cent, is the clear average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that our figures have not been presented in proper comparison with others. One must take like for like. In this financial year, the possible local income tax would have to be compared with the poll tax. The figures from which the Minister quoted show like for like in the current financial year. If figures are required to be provided on a different basis—that is, not including the reduction of £140 from which some people have benefited—that can be done. The figures that the Minister used were honest and I am sorry that he suggested that they were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman does not quite have the point. The figures that I gave were on the basis of what the Liberal Democrats are suggesting. The Liberal Democrats voted against the £140 reduction and did not take into account the rebate system. They also believe that 15 per cent, of local government expenditure is too small a level to be borne by local authorities. We have taken the Liberal Democrats at their word and have come up with figures which show local income tax rates at 7p, 8p and 9p in the pound. That is an honest way to calculate it. The hon. Gentleman is being disingenuous by pretending that he can take into account cuts in local government expenditure against which he voted when calculating his proposed new tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a Government who, in this financial year, have given most people a poll tax reduction of £140. Clearly, if we are producing figures for this year, we must take that on board. Regarding future financial years, we do not have promises from the Government about what help there will be and whether the £4·5 billion will continue to be available year after year. However, if one makes that assumption, one can produce a set of figures that take that into consideration. We have produced figures that give a like for like comparison and that is the most honest thing that any party can do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that what we are proposing would become a national tax. I want to make it clear that the local income tax will be set by the local authority, not by the Government, so it cannot be a national tax. It would be collected—purely—by the Inland Revenue. In our two tiers of local authority, the district and county councils in England, the district councils in the shire areas collect the local tax, but the county council will have set a precept, a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
sum of money, which it will ask the district to collect on its behalf. In exactly the same way the Inland Revenue would collect a locally-set tax on behalf of the local authority. There would be no opportunity for the Inland Revenue to do anything other than pass that money back to the local authority association for distribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman was responding to a challenge from a Tory Minister, he said that his party would hope to see a commensurate reduction in the national income tax collection once the local income tax collection had started up, and that the reduction would be in parity with the new local income tax collection. It was then pointed out that he was therefore proposing a national income system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can begin to see where some misunderstanding might have occurred. It is in the medium and longer term that we see a shift towards a greater proportion of local tax being raised locally. If we are talking only about the like-for-like figures in the current financial year, they are based without any increase or transfer. But, yes, in the longer term, the Liberal Democrats would like to see more tax raised locally. Clearly, that means that there is less of a necessity to raise tax nationally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not just at the moment. I also want to respond to the important point that our proposed system would lead to two classes. I shall explain it by saying that we make no apology for asking those who are able to pay to pay and for telling those who cannot that they need not but that they will still be able to able to enjoy the services provided by the local autority. That is an honourable position and I am sorry that hon. Members have concluded that it would lead to two classes of people because it is exactly what we have as our national system. Those who are able to contribute to national taxation do so, quite properly, and those who cannot afford to do so, do not. I hope that no one believes that those who do not contribute to national taxation should feel that they are in a second class. That is not what most hon. Members would want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A minute ago the hon. Gentleman talked about precepting from county levels. Those of us who represent metropolitan authorities no longer have county authorities to precept. In their place we have four key organisations which deliver services: the fire and civil defence authority, the police authority, the passenger transport executive and the waste disposal authority. They all have precepting powers which they utilise. Despite that, they are independent of the districts in setting those precepts. Have the Liberal Democrats taken those factors into consideration when giving out their average figures for income tax levels for metropolitan boroughs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we have. Clearly those experiences are known. Moreover, across the whole of England the police authorities make their precept and inform the county councils which in turn build it into their budgets. The county councils cannot really influence the amount and they must then call upon the districts to levy it in order for it to be passed through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I really want to make progress. I am grateful for the length of time that I have been allowed to answer questions but I want to deal with another important issue. A number of figures have been bandied about in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have not given way to the hon. Gentleman before, I shall now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that the figure of 3·3 per cent, or 4 per cent, for local income tax takes no account of the Liberal Democrats' policy to get rid of the £140 per head reduction in local government taxation, to abolish community charge and local government expenditure capping, and to allow local government taxation to fund more local government expenditure. In a general election, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) will have to answer the question: if—God forbid—a Liberal Democrat Government were elected; if—God forbid—the Liberal Democrats' policies on local government finance were enacted, what local income tax rate would be applied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be obvious, even to the hon. Gentleman, that if the rate of local income tax increases and the revenue required for local services remains the same, the rate of national taxation will decrease.

Specific figures have been mentioned, including those for Easbourne. I gave the figures for Eastbourne on Second Reading. I shall not repeat them, but they are in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> Those figures were researched. They are very different from the figures that the Minister presented to the Committee tonight. I am astounded by his figures; they are as inaccurate as the figures given by some Government spokespersons for several years. They should be checked. I shall quote some figures that are based on the 3.3 per cent, average rate. I shall compare the figures with the poll tax, so they are also based on the average poll tax in England, which is £252, and on an average household of one person who earns and another who does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A student will pay 20 per cent, of the poll tax for next year. That is about £50.40. A housewife with no income is expected to pay £252, although she has no ability to pay it. Pensioner couples who have an income of £4.329 are expected to pay an average poll tax of £100.80. They do not have the income to make that sort of contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a household which consists of a male postman who earns £10,000 and his wife or partner, who works part time and earns £5,000, the average poll tax is £504. Under a local income tax system, based on an average rate of 3.3 per cent., that household would make a contribution of only £277.53, because a joint income of £15,000 is very low. However, a Member of Parliament who earns £28,970 and pays an average poll tax of £504, would pay £790.52 under a local income tax system. That is above the average poll tax. Members of Parliament would pay more because £28,970 is well above the national average wage. People who earn such wages would be expected to pay more under a local income tax scheme. Cabinet Ministers, who earn £59,000, would pay £1,800 under a local income tax system. Perhaps that is why some hon. Members object to the system. However, I have shown that those amounts are all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
related to the ability to pay. Those who earn a sizeable income will pay far more than those who earn a low income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked me about national objectives when compared with local objectives. I thought I had covered that, but at the end of the day, one has to decide where decisions are taken about the delivery of essential local services. We make no apology for saying that those decisions should be taken locally near the people who need those services. To take them centrally would be against everything that local government stands for. Our proposals would deliver the best quality and quantity of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether he believes that there should be any controls by national Government on local government capital spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we had introduced a fair voting system, we would have delivered accountability for the actions of local authorities, and central Government controls would not be needed on revenue or capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have dealt with it once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate, it was said that a local income tax would involve a great deal of bureaucracy, and a list was mentioned. That is a bit thick, coming from the Government. What is the difference between a register and a list? I have asked that question on the Floor of the House and the answer was very unconvincing. The head of financial services in the Eastbourne borough treasurer's department said some time ago:
	<br><q><p>"We cannot see how the proposed council tax could be properly billed, and collected, without maintaining a form of register to show entitlements to personal discounts."</p></q>
How are the personal discounts to be recorded if not on some sort of register? It is purely semantics to say that there will be no register but mere will be a list. We have never had an explanation from the Government of the difference between a register and a list. It is a bit much for the Government to suggest that bureaucracy would be greater under a local income tax. I notice that the Ministers are beavering away behind their books so that they do not have to answer the point. I am eager to give way to a Minister who can explain the difference between a register and a list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the hon. Member the difference. A list is a list of properties and the people who are liable for the council tax. A register contains every single person whether they are paying me tax or not. The simple aspect of the council tax is that those people who wish to claim a discount will have to inform the local authority, but otherwise me local authority will have no wish to know about those people who will not be paying the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That explanation is interesting, but the Minister did not address the issue of the difference between a register and a list. He merely talked about the people who would be on the list or register. A record is either kept on piles of papers or as a list which then becomes a register. I have already said that one local authority believes that it will have to maintain a register. I believe that local authority associations are unanimous in their view that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
they will have to maintain a register of sorts. The Government are playing with semantics. I will give way again and the Minister can have another try.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try again, but it is a bit difficult to get through to the hon. Gentleman at this time of night. The rating list was a list of those people who were liable for rates. It did not include everybody else in the property who was not liable for rates. A council tax list will be a list of those liable to pay the council tax and will also contain those people who apply for discounts. It will not have anybody else on it. A register contains everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a brave try, but no better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I suggest to the hon. Gentleman, in support of the Minister's comments and extending them further, that there is a large difference between lists kept on paper and lists stored electronically? If the hon. Gentleman examines the data protection legislation and the draft directive on data protection from Brussels, he will see that I am right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is guilty of using the word local falsely. To me, a local income tax means a locally decided fund-raising capacity based on locally gathered and locally
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
stored knowledge on which local decisions are taken. He misuses the word. He means a national tax, redistributed locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's first comment was about the Data Protection Act 1988. Local authorities intend to use computers to collect information for the council tax. Councils have discussed with providers what software will be available. When that information is stored, the councils will come under the Data Protection Act 1988 in the same way as they did in respect of the poll tax. There is no difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local income tax works in dozens of other countries across the world. Hon. Members who believe that it can be destroyed by words in a Committee are not prepared to seek beyond this country for ideas. That shows much about the sad position of our country on a range of issues. The Government have wasted £19 billion on the poll tax and can ill afford to reject an idea that works in many other countries. They should consider local income tax more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that excellent airing of our ideas, I should like to raise the amendment again later, when members of the Committee will want to consider it more carefully. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
