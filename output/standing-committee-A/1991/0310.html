<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Raffan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. I received notification of my membership of the Committee about half an hour ago. Is that in order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in order. The matter is not for me, but for the Committee of Selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. As you quite rightly said, it is a matter for the Committee of Selection, but such lack of notice is inconvenient for members of the Committee. I take the point that the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Raffan) made. If all hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies—and other hon. Members appointed by the Committee of Selection— were entitled to receive an invitation to the sitting, we should surely have been given time to do some preparatory work before debating the Bill. If the fault lies with the Committee of Selection, the Government or the Clerk's Department, that should be explained to the Committee. We should have been given the choice of either accepting the invitation and participating or of rejecting the invitation and deciding to meet on another day. We should all have been properly invited to the Committee and given sufficient time to consider all the matters that relate to the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill.<br><br>
Of course, the Bill has been in Parliament long enough and has been talked about at such length that all Members of the Committee should have a certain amount of knowledge about it. However, not even the hon. Member for Delyn could not have an intricate knowledge of the amendments or have digested them properly in the few minutes that followed his being notified of our sitting.<br><br>
Hon. Members have other commitments today. For various reasons, several Members representing Welsh constituencies were not originally included on the Committee by the Committee of Selection. They want to participate in today's debate on the Bill. However, they were notified only last night or first thing this morning when they opened their mail that they had now been selected. That is inconsiderate of the Clerk's Department, the Government or whoever is responsible. The Government have been negligent throughout the proceedings on the Bill. If they are at fault, the Committee should be informed so that the matter can be fully debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already informed the Committee that that is a matter not for me but for the Committee of Selection. However, I have sympathy with some of the points that have been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
made. If the Committee wants to move a dilatory motion, I would be prepared to accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
<p>That the Committee do now adjourn.—[<i>Mr. Morgan.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words on that matter. This is the second time that the Bill has been subjected to what one might call an attempt to rush its fences while it has been under the tactical and masterful control of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. We shall all miss his presence—and, in our more sado-masochistic moments, his hyena-like cackle—in the next Parliament. Last July, just one week before the summer recess, the Under-Secretary attempted to introduce a Bill, although there was no point in doing so because the House was about to adjourn. The Standing Orders Committee, with a Conservative majority, quite rightly threw out the Bill. I am grateful to the Conservative Members on that Committee for doing that.<br><br>
The same is happening now. One week before the House adjourns for a 99.9 per cent certain general election, we have been asked to rush our fences, with the Bill being brought to Committee on Budget day. That is an extremely unwise move because we shall not be able to give the Bill proper consideration while we have other matters on our minds—the Budget and the impending general election.<br><br>
We have been dragged here this morning because, when such matters are rushed, procedural mistakes tend to be made. Standing Order No. 86 was not considered. As a result, members of the Committee found out at 6.30 p.m. last night, at the earliest, that they were required to be in Committee today. In my view, the only proper course of action is to adjourn the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) was full of his usual collection of nonsense. This is not a matter for the Government; the Committee of Selection determines who shall sit on a Committee. It has determined that all hon. Members with Welsh constituencies shall sit on the Committee. The fact that the Committee of Selection made that decision yesterday is something for which it must answer. It has nothing to do with the Government. The Bill has been debated extensively, both in its present and previous forms. The former private Bill was debated for 25i hours on the Floor of the House. It was also examined in detail—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. Which previous Bills were discussed in the House is not the business of the Committee. The Minister should deal with the problems of this Committee. He has not discussed the Bill at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will decide that. I think that the Minister is developing an argument about why the Committee should not be adjourned.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Lofthouse. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) is keen that we should not hear the facts, but I shall repeat what I said. The former private Bill was debated for 25i hours on the Floor of the House. It was also examined in detail by two Select Committees, for 27 days in this House and 14 days in another place. This Bill was debated for more than four hours on Second Reading, and a House of Commons Select Committee recently completed 14 days of further detailed examination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. The hon. Gentleman must withdraw that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that I did not want to know the facts. That is a lie; it is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the word "lie".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under your instructions, Mr. Lofthouse, I so withdraw. However, I appeal to the Minister to accept that, during discussion of the Bill, I have been the most open minded of all hon. Members who have spoken. I may have voted in a certain way at the end of various debates, but I have always been open to argument and discussion. If the Minister continues to press his point, I shall continue to say what he really is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that the hon. Member for Rhondda, who interrupted me when I started to detail how much examination of the Cardiff bay barrage proposal has taken place, objects when I say that he is trying to prevent me from putting the facts to the Committee. That is a fair description of his action. The hon. Gentleman is not fair minded and open on this issue; he has been opposed to the Bill from the beginning. He has spoken against it and voted against it in the House. That is not my idea of a fair-minded and balanced view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The manner in which the Minister speaks in support of the Bill is likely to influence not only those who have consistently voted against it but those who, like me have consistently voted in its favour. Although, coming from Swansea, I was brought up with a certain view of Cardiff, I have consistently supported the Bill. The way in which the Minister is now introducing it is rapidly influencing me against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) is so easily influenced in relation to a Bill affecting the future of Cardiff by the fact that the Minister is responding to the hon. Member for Rhondda, who interrupted a simple recitation of the number of hours spent in consideration of the Bill, the Opposition are on their way to trying to delay the progress of the Bill. The Bill is most important to the future of Cardiff. It is a Bill that needs to be debated in Committee. It has been debated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
extensively on the Floor of the House. In my view, we could complete its Committee stage today if that were the Committee's wish. If some hon. Members wish to obstruct the Bill—as we know some do—it will be in their hands if the Bill does not go forward today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are being asked to debate a Bill for which, as members of a Standing Committee, we are not prepared. That is a simple enough assertion. Half an hour ago, I opened my mail and found a card. I was expected to rush to the Committee without knowing what amendments had been tabled. It is nonsense to expect us to make an important decision that would affect the capital city of the Principality, the ecology of the area and our attitude to the whole question of Welsh estuaries and barrages without our having the necessary documents and briefs.<br><br>
It is ludicrous for the Minister to expect that we should come to Committee armed with all necessary information merely because the Bill was debated on the Floor of the House for 25 hours. The situation changes from week to week, as he knows. We have no choice but to support the motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West. (Mr. Morgan).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raffan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All Members of Parliament who represent Welsh constituencies realise that the Bill is important. I am from the north of the Principality, so the Bill does not affect me directly, but I have taken an interest in it and am strongly in favour. The last thing that I wish to do is to do anything to damage its progress.<br><br>
I do not know who is responsible for today's cock-up but at such short notice we cannot possibly debate in detail, and in the intelligent way that it deserves, a matter that has serious consequences for Cardiff and for the Principality generally. The idea is absurd. My hon. Friend the Minister will not be surprised to hear me say that his contribution has not helped; it will turn those who favour the Bill against it. I am strongly in favour and find myself in a quandary. I do not wish to delay progress, but we have not had sufficient notice to prepare properly to debate this complex and detailed measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Raffan). It is not a question of agreeing or disagreeing with the Bill and its many facets. It has 30 clauses, which makes it complicated. I am told that there are almost 50 amendments on the Order Paper. The customary procedure of the House is that, perhaps after the first sitting of a Committee, the usual channels informally agree to an end-date for the Committee stage and both sides tend to work within that constraint and that timetable. That would be the proper way here. It might take three, four or five sittings but no one is being obstructive, so it could be agreed. In the House we debate constitutional reform—a Bill of Rights and other measures which I do not favour all that much. If Parliament is asked to push through important legislation in one day hon. Members will of course
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
argue that that is not the constitutional and proper way.<br><br>
I assume that the Government are responsible for bringing the Bill forward at this stage: after all, they are in charge of Government business, but it is a most inopportune time. Let us by all means debate some amendments if we have to. The most sensible course, though, would be to adjourn, agree a timetable and debate the Bill in the usual way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnor)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of my ancestors helped build Cardiff and were involved in the city's business life. They would turn in their graves if they knew that the Bill was to be considered in the space of a couple of hours and would reach the statute book perhaps with glaring errors in it. We need reasoned debate and time, and today is not the right time. I support an adjournment of the sitting for commonsense reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is great to be present when there is all-party support for the adjournment of our proceedings on the Bill. I take the same view as right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken. It is ludicrous to have before us a Bill that is in desperate need of amending but to have no opportunity to amend it. For example, under the Bill, cases may need to go to the Lands Tribunal so that compensation problems can be discussed. Yet no legal aid is available to people coming before that tribunal, so it will disadvantage many people on low incomes. Many other issues arise.<br><br>
What is happening here is wholly unacceptable to the people of Wales. They will find it amazing if the Bill is driven through. If it is, democracy will be the loser. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), we should adjourn the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), about the Committee of Selection and the extraordinary way in which members of the Committee were chosen, it is difficult to accept the assertion that the question has had insufficient attention paid to it. I had the good fortune to Chair the Select Committee, and it sat for five weeks taking evidence on the issues. Other hon. Members were also present. Approximately 83 petitions were submitted, and the Bill was amended substantially. I am sure that hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies will have followed the proceedings of the Select Committee very closely. I do not accept that they have arrived in this Committee in a state of unprepared ignorance.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
As I said, I have substantial sympathy with the points that have been raised. However, it cannot be in the interests of the people of Cardiff for the Bill to be delayed further. Almost all the evidence submitted to the Select Committee suggested that everyone wanted the Bill to proceed on to the statute book. That is exactly what it should do, in a proper form, as amended by the Select Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an extraordinary statement. I remember sitting on the Channel Tunnel Bill Select Committee a few years ago, and it went on for much longer than the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill Select Committee. At the end of the day, however, the Standing Committee considering the Channel Tunnel Bill met in the normal way: people who were not on the Select Committee had the opportunity to peruse the evidence and to table amendments.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Upminster (Sir Nicholas Bonsor) is suggesting that we, as members of the Committee, are to be precluded from tabling amendments—[<i>Interruption.</i>] We certainly cannot do it in one day. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that we should get on with it? Is he suggesting that we should table amendments now and debate them today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that we should do it all today, and I very much doubt whether it could be. If the hon. Gentleman is so minded, he could table amendments to be considered at our next sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. I am sorry, but I thought that he was following the Minister's line—[hon. Members: "No,"] Then I withdraw the allegation—except to say that the Government Whips have worked hard to put pressure on individual members of the Committee. We have seen them operating. The Minister wants the Bill to proceed in one day, but that simply is not on. It is entirely unacceptable for us to be asked to serve on a Committee without having had the opportunity to table amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Upminster said that the vast majority of people in the Principality supported the Bill. That could be established by a referendum; but I doubt whether the majority of the people in Cardiff would be in favour of it. Whichever way it goes, we do not know. What we do know is that a substantial number of people's lives will be affected and that some are unsure about the compensation arrangements and therefore against the Bill. Views can develop as time progresses.<br><br>
This is a Standing Committee, not a Select Committee. If the Bill goes through normal procedure and is adopted at the end of the day, so be it. But we cannot do our task in one day, as the Minister wants, or in a couple of weeks, as the hon. Member for Upminster wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Hayward <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Sir Nicholas Bonsor) about starting consideration of the Bill this morning. I can understand my hon. Friend and Opposition Members railing against the Committee of Selection for giving inadequate notice. I share their anger. I was fortunate enough to be noticed at the back end of last week, whereas others are understandably angered at being given such short notice.<br><br>
My hon. Friend argued that the Bill has been around in one form or another for a long time. The Select Committee on which both he and I sat was not the first Select Committee. We should begin
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
consideration of the Bill today because, like my hon. Friend, I believe that the vast majority of people want the Bill in one form or another. Therefore, it is appropriate to start consideration of the Bill, having registered our concern about the way in which the Committee of Selection notified many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole question of the way in which the Bill has been dealt with in the House of Commons has been touched upon by the Minister. The hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward) said that it was necessary for the Bill to be considered now. If any obstruction has occurred, it is entirely the Government's fault. Some months ago, the Government failed to ensure that there were sufficient numbers of hon. Members to vote for the Bill, and it collapsed. They failed to get the hybrid Bill right in the summer. They have now failed to go to the Committee of Selection to ensure that there is a special procedure whereby all Welsh Members of Parliament are allowed to sit on Committee considering Bills such as this as was arranged in the 1970s for the Committee considering the Development Board for Rural Wales. All hon. Members should have been given sufficient notice of this Committee.<br><br>
The Minister appears to be disaster prone with this Bill. That reminds me of the description given by Mr. Disraeli of the difference between a disaster and a catastrophe, when he referred to Gladstone and the Thames. A disaster is when the Minister falls into Cardiff bay and a catastrophe is when he is pulled out.<br><br>
In all seriousness, the points made about why the Committee should be adjourned have nothing, by any stretch of the imagination, to do with obstructing the Bill. It is to do with a proper and reasoned consideration of the amendments before us. If all hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies are rightly expected to attend, they should have been given sufficient notice about what they could table and what would be considered by way of debate.<br><br>
The important amendments on the amendment paper deal with the quality of water, groundwater levels and flooding, the absence of the question of birds and wildlife in the Select Committee's report, and a host of other matters—which the Select Committee rightly wanted this committee to consider. In all seriousness, we cannot say to the hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies that because they received notice of this Committee only this morning, that they cannot participate. That is unfortunate and I sincerely hope that we shall return a procedure by which all these matters can be considered.<br><br>
Many of the important amendments before us were prompted by Cardiff city council, so we must bear in mind that it is in favour of the barrage. We must give proper consideration to these and other amendments. The only way that we can do that, in fairness to all hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies, is to adjourn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) started off on the premise that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
this was a matter for the Government. It is not. The Committee of Selection is a Committee of this House and the Government have no control over which hon. Members serve on which Committee. Indeed, the Labour party put forward only a certain number of hon. Members for membership. It did not put forward all of their Welsh Members to serve on the Committee; it put forward a selected number, which did not include the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan).<br><br>
I regret that the Committee of Selection sent out notices at the last moment, but that must be a matter for the Chairman of the Committee of Selection. The fact is that the Bill has been debated for a long time in both Houses. If this dilatory motion is defeated, I propose to move that the Committee should sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings for as long as is necessary to debate the amendments tabled.<br><br>
It seems right that we should refuse the dilatory motion, get on to the sittings motion and decide when and how often we need to sit. That motion will be open to amendment, so if hon. Members want to sit more often than Tuesdays and Thursdays they can move an amendment to achieve that. To continue to debate whether we should meet at all, when we could spend that valuable time in debating the amendments, shows that some Labour Members want to obstruct the Bill, not get on with the job of debating it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aggrieved that the Minister should take such a line. When he was included in the Committee, I guessed that he would aggravate matters. I knew that he would not help matters because we have been used to that for a number of years, both before and since he became a Minister. He has aggravated matters again today.<br><br>
I must declare an interest. I support the proposals in the Bill and have done so since they were first presented in the form of a private Bill. I believe that I am the only valley Member of Parliament who has expressed such support over the years. My reason for doing so is that the barrage would be 18 miles from my constituency and, since 1979, the Government's attitude to employment in my area has ensured that instead of having only 3.7 per cent unemployment, as we had in 1979, we now have unemployment of 17 to 20 per cent. Obviously, if jobs were available because of the development of the Cardiff bay barrage, some of my constituents could travel those 18 miles to get one of them. Many of them travel even further than that at present.<br><br>
It is essential to consider employment. The Bill poses difficulties and problems and I sympathise with many of my hon. Friends' objections to its proposals. Some of those objections have been valid but others are bogus, as were some of the earlier points of order. I have stood four square behind those who have wanted the Bill to be passed, although I have not participated to a great degree in our debates as I have been the Whip on most occasions. Today, I consider it essential to participate despite being the Whip.<br><br>
I also sit on the Committee of Selection, as the Clerk knows only too well because he has served as the Clerk to the Committee of Selection for many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
years. We submit an agenda for appointing Members of Parliament. When a programme is submitted to us on a Monday, we seek to appoint people. I am concerned that when the Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going rather wide of the motion, which is whether the Committee should adjourn. I should be grateful if he would get back to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting back to the motion. I have been asked to do so not only by you, Mr. Lofthouse, but by several hon. Members.<br><br>
The private Bill to which the Minister referred was discussed at length and failed. Today, we are debating not a private Bill introduced to Parliament by the old Cardiff corporation, but a Government Bill. The Government decided to introduce the Bill and hoped to use their majority of 130 plus to ensure that it would get through. It is their responsibility to ensure that the Bill is passed. However, some hon. Members are not present this morning because they were not notified about the Committee. It is impossible for all hon. Members elected in Wales to make their contributions to the Bill unless they are properly notified by the Committee of Selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart Bell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Middlesbrough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put, <i>but</i> The CHAIRMAN <i>withheld his assent, and declined to put that Question.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does any other hon. Member wish to speak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be long, Mr. Lofthouse. I cannot understand why the Committee has been wasting its time since 10.30 this morning. As has been implied, the subject has been well rehearsed and many hours have been spent considering the Bill in its different forms. I am amazed at some of the comments from the Opposition Members who have made long speeches in the House and who have achieved delay in the past. We see in the Committee the Luddite tendency of the Labour party of south Wales coming to the fore—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to hear nothing more about any Luddite tendency; I want to hear why the Committee should or should not be adjourned. I would appreciate it if the hon. Gentleman would keep to the narrow motion.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will keep to the motion, Mr. Lofthouse.<br><br>
We have not heard any valid arguments for adjourning the Committee; we have heard only the lack of argument that has typified the Oppposition throughout this Parliament. Those who have nothing positive to contribute to the consideration of the Bill should leave it to those of us who are passionately concerned about what happens in the capital city of Wales and in south Wales generally.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some trepidation in the cauldron of emotion about the Bill. I sat on the Select Committee which considered the Bill and I was able to consider the subject objectively and dispassionately because I am disinterested in local political terms. In the Standing Committee there is a confluence of interests and pressures. A general election is coming up and there is great drama in the Committee and pressure to make political speeches that are unconnected with the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill. This is a Government Bill and the Government want it to go through before the general election. It has been argued from both sides of the Committee that the matter has been thoroughly aired during the past five or six years and that democracy has been at work in Cardiff for more than six years, but there has not been a centime of investment in the Cardiff bay barrage as a result of that debate.<br><br>
It is clear to me as an outsider that the sooner that the debate on the Bill is brought to an end, the sooner the people of Cardiff will be able to accommodate the decisions of the House and the sooner they will be able to settle down with the project.<br><br>
We then enter the parliamentary sphere in that we, as parliamentarians, must scrutinise the Bill line by line. The Select Committee made some recommendations but left some matters to be discussed by the Standing Committee. Those of us who have been in the House for a while know that, regrettably, we must live with bad legislation for which we are responsible because we did not analyse in sufficient depth or did not conceive of the consequences of that legislation. At this stage of the Parliament it is clear to Opposition Members who are opposed to the Bill and wish to amend it, as well as to Opposition Members who support the Bill, that there is not the slightest possibility of it reaching the statute book before the general election. I therefore support my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West, (Mr. Morgan) in demanding that the Committee do now adjourn so that a new Parliament may take up where we leave off and give the Bill and the amendments—if they appear on the amendment paper before a new Committee—the proper scrutiny that Parliament and the electorate demand of us, so that the people of Cardiff will be satisfied that we have done our duty by them.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Aves 17, Noes 10.</p>
