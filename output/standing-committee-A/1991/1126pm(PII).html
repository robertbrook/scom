	<p>	<i>[Continuation from column 422]</i></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Leadbitter. I think that I speak for the whole Committee when I say that we greatly appreciate your decision to give us two hours for dinner. Would it, however, be possible, on occasions when we are going to sit until the early hours, to have that break a little later in the evening, so that we do not face a full five hours of ranting from the Opposition without a break?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we come to that, we will decide. The Committee will have its will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate and I was surprised to learn that the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) had finished his speech. Amendments Nos. 127 and 167 would remove the discount for single people and replace it with one for people on any one of a number of benefits. Amendment No. 184 would make corresponding provision for a second adult in a household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments reveal the Labour party's position for what it is. It is unfair and unjust, and I hope that all single householders in Britain will take careful note of what the Opposition are proposing. Amendments Nos. 127 and 167 would remove the 25 per cent. discount for a single-person household. That would take us back to the most unpopular aspect of the old rating system. It is not fair that a single person should have to pay the same amount of local taxation for living in a property identical to a neighbouring house that contains two or more adults living in identical circumstances. That is a matter of principle on which there is a clear divide between the Government and the Opposition, and I am happy to go into any election campaign defending that division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the strongest criticisms of the rating system was that single people in identical circumstances and living in houses identical to those of other people in their road—not millionaires, whom the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) always goes on about, but people in the ordinary streets of Britain where the vast majority of people live, in three-bedroom detached and semi-detached houses—paid the same. Single people living cheek by jowl with couples or with households of three or four people of working age paid the same amount in rates. We considered that unfair and I am delighted that the Government are going to do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful for that clear exposition. Will the Minister do everything in his power to
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
ensure that at the next election, whenever it comes, single people living alone—including single pensioners who are above the benefit level—are made fully aware of the choice that they face when they go to the ballot box?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and there could not be a clearer divide between the parties on this issue. I am delighted that the Labour party is so opposed to single people, as the amendments show.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister believes so strongly in that principle, why cannot he answer the question put to him by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)? Why limit the discount to households of only two people? Why not extend it, as the poll tax did?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, with all the talk about elections and campaigning, the Minister will be delighted to know that the Tory party in Scotland in 1987 campaigned on the issue of the poll tax and the single person. I am delighted to hear that the Tory party intends to do that throughout the rest of the United Kingdom at the next general election. It will achieve the same result throughout the United Kingdom as it achieved in Scotland in 1987.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the next election, it will become clear that the Government listened to the criticisms of the community charge, and that they are determined not to make the mistake that the Opposition have made. Having spent years saying how unfair the rating system was, the Opposition have now returned to that discredited system. They call their so-called policy the fair rating system. That description is about as false as describing the German Democratic Republic as democratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge members of the Labour party to ask five people out in the street whether they know what its fair rates policy is about. The fact is that nobody knows. At the moment, people might think that it would be fair because of the Labour party's use of the word "fair". They are being conned. People will find out how unfair the Labour party's policy is, and will recognise the politics of envy that we have experienced in Committee. Single people living alone would be penalised by the Labour party's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman has just had a go. I want to go on to my next point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard all about the Opposition's proposals for a so-called fair rating system. In place of the Government's proposals that all single-person households should receive a 25 per cent. discount, amendments Nos. 127 and 167 would introduce a similar discount for households in which either the liable person or spouse had savings of less than £16,000 and was in receipt of one of several benefits or certain training allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee already knows that we propose to give rebates of up to 100 per cent. to those on low incomes. That is a much fairer and simple approach than that of allowing the receipt of other benefits to influence the initial council tax bill. Entitlement to benefits does not denote that the person concerned is on low income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose that special arrangements should operate for people with disabilities and YTS trainees. Both groups of people are mentioned in amendments Nos. 127 and 167. What does the Labour party have in store for people with disabilities and for those who are YTS trainees? Amendments Nos. 98 and 169 would remove the 25 per cent. discount for a household where the presence of all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
but one resident was disregarded. They would replace it with a 25 per cent. discount for a household where all the residents are disregarded. The Labour party—the party which wants fair rates—wants a household comprising three YTS trainees to pay 75 per cent. of the council tax bill, while the Government propose that they should pay only 50 per cent. Opposition Members cannot even get their amendments right. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Given the rowdiness of Conservative Members' behaviour, is it not obvious that a two-hour break for dinner is far too long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene on my hon. Friend's after-dinner speech, but will he draw attention to the enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) for his Scrooge-like policy, which has gone from strength to strength during our proceedings? At our first sitting, the hon. Gentleman said that 40 per cent. of households in inner London were single-person households. Recently, he said that 50 per cent. of households were one-person households. Will my hon. Friend ensure that the report of the hon. Gentleman's speech is distributed widely throughout the constituency of Dagenham?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that, just as my speech on the local income tax will be distributed widely in Eastbourne, Ribble Valley and other places where Liberal Democrats are in control, I shall ensure that the report of the speech that I am making tonight is disseminated among the burghers of Dagenham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister also draw attention to the fact that we have tabled an amendment that would provide a 50 per cent. discount to single-person households?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that, when we reach that amendment, the Liberal Democrat Party can argue its own case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the Labour party's amendments Nos. 98 and 169 would have other effects. A household consisting of two severely mentally impaired people and another adult, who was not caring for them or who was not a professional care worker, would, under our proposals, have to pay 75 per cent. of the bill while, under the proposals of the unfair party, they would face a 100 per cent. bill. Is that what Opposition Members want? Perhaps on reflection they will feel moved to withdraw the amendment. If they do not, we shall do to them what they tried to do to us. We shall ensure that the local newspapers in their constituencies reveal how they voted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendments Nos. 128 and 168 and the consequential amendments Nos. 185 and 189, a hint of fairness seems to have crept in. Having removed the 25 per cent. discount for all single-person households, the Labour party—consistent to the last—now seeks to reintroduce it, but only for single householders aged 60 or over and under a new name, the single pensioner premium. Certainly, there is a premium on consistency and fairness among Opposition Members; and I ask the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
Dagenham to explain why, if our proposals for a discount for single householders are fair for the over 60s, they are wrong for younger people. I see no good reason for discriminating on grounds of age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do the Government discriminate against people under 25 in the social security system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe for a moment that the Government discriminate against those under 25, but to encourage them we make special provision for them in view of their working age and the amount of education that they can get. That is a very different system. The hon. Gentleman's intervention was a red herring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The single pensioner premium would be complex to administer. Councils would need to know the age of every householder living alone to judge when the premium would be payable, and it would also be misplaced. Our proposals are based on a clear distinction between discounts under clause 11, which will help people who live on their own—such as widows, whatever their age, and lone parents—and council tax benefit under schedule 9, which will help those on low incomes to pay their council tax. The amendment would mean that young widows with children would have to pay a 100 per cent. bill. Is that really what they want? They have made no provision for young widows under 60 who are protected by the Government's legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I correct in thinking that the Labour party's grudging and reluctant concession in its new proposals to those over 60—it has been given only because of moral pressure from Consverative Members—would be limited to pensioners whose assets and income place them below the benefit level? I understand that those pensioners who have an income or assets above the £16,000 threshold would not benefit from the Labour party's concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has slightly misunderstood the position. Labour Members want to have it all ways, so they have tabled amendments which restrict the concession to pensioners and other people with less than £16,000 capital who are on various benefits, but they have a catch-all. They have moved to what they call the "single pensioner premium", which applies to all pensioners over the age of 60. They are therefore going for the millionaire vote as well, just as they wanted to go for the people on benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that not show that we have the Labour party on the run on that issue? Can we look forward to the moment when Labour Members will accept the good sense of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Having rejected the principle of a single person getting a discount, Labour Members have introduced it in the amendments for people over 60. As usual, they are trying to have it all ways, but the public will see through that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 80 and its Scottish counterpart, amendment No. 84, which have been tabled by the Liberal Democrats, would grant a discount of 25 per cent. to any household where one resident was disabled and another was a live-in carer who did not fall to be disregarded for the purposes of discount. Such people are already provided for in paragraph 9 of schedule 1, which grants a discount for a person
	<br><blockquote><p>"engaged in providing care or support (or both) to another person"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
and meeting other conditions prescribed in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the hon. Members for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) and for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) tabled the amendment because they care about such people, but there is already provision in the Bill. There is therefore no need for their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Carers are exempt from the community charge under similar provisions in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 which have been implemented by regulations. Groups representing people with disabilities have pressed us to extend those regulations to include a wider range of carers. We have asked them to submit their views on how live-in carers should be defined; when they have done so, we shall consider how the regulations for council tax purposes should be framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in one respect gone further than amendments Nos. 80 and 84 require in respect of carers. As the consultation paper issued in April made clear, we propose to exempt from the council tax those dwellings that are empty because the former occupier has moved to provide care to another person. That will be achieved in regulations made under clause 4, which was debated last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on reflection the hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Argyll and Bute will decide not to press their amendments. The Government oppose all these amendments which are either unnecessary or, like the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham and his hon. Friends, counter-productive and would not help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to deal with points raised during the speech of the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). Several hon. Members talked about the detail of the council tax benefit system. We shall, of course, have ample opportunity to discuss those arrangements next week, if Opposition Members do not spend four hours discussing one group of amendments. The other place, too, will want to consider them. We shall be able to scrutinise the regulations in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for non-dependant deductions, we have always made it clear that the benefit arrangements will broadly follow the system—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to finish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been talking incessantly!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a minute, but first I must tell a little story about the hon. Member for Makerfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is presently detained elsewhere—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—but not at Her Majesty's pleasure, as the hon. Member for Makerfield so uncharitably said. The hon. Member for Leeds, West and possibly the hon. Members for Makerfield and for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) served on the Committee that considered the Local Government and Housing Bill in 1989. The hon. Member for Makerfield organised a competition to find the most boring member of the Committee—whoever made the longest and most turgid speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I won it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman did not win it; he was the sponsor of the competition. The prize went to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). Those hon. Members who have served on Committees with the hon. Gentleman know that there was no competition because he is liberal with his rhetoric and goes on for hours. After about 150 hours, when the Committee had completed its work, the hon. Member for Makerfield presented the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey with a silver cup for making the most boring speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield is tonight making it a clear bid to get that cup back. During the four-hour debate on the first group of amendments, the hon. Gentleman, who has the gall to criticise me for speaking for 16 minutes, spoke for two of those hours. The hon. Gentleman admitted last week that he spoke only because the Whip had told him to do so. The other place will want to make a careful note of that. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I welcome back the hon. Member for Leeds, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Can we be assured that you would rule out of order a repetition of the Minister's story?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair is deliberately allowing a good deal of flippancy and even flexibility because it is traditional, in my experience, that time is needed to settle down after dinner. Perhaps that time is now over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall simply tell the hon. Member for Leeds, West that in his absence his hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield suggested that he might have been detained at Her Majesty's pleasure. We are glad to see that police inquiries are over and that the hon. Gentleman has returned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the subject of non-dependant deductions. We have always made it clear that the benefit arrangements will broadly follow the system that already applies in other income-related benefits. We consider that it is right in principle that non-dependant adults sharing a property with a liable person who is entitled to council tax benefit should make some contribution to the council tax bill. The details of those arrangements will be a matter for regulations, and further announcements will be made shortly. The Committee will be well aware that there is already a system of non-dependant deductions in housing benefit, and similar arrangements applied under rate rebates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, several hon. Members asked about rebates in respect of second adults on low incomes living in a household where the liable person was not himself entitled to council tax benefit on the basis of his own income. We are aware of the concerns expressed by the local authority associations to minimise the administrative complexity of the scheme. In the light of those comments, we have been looking to simplify the arrangements and, again, we hope to be in a position to make an announcement of the details shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will understand that I am not able to give a more detailed response at this stage. We will no doubt return to the issue when we discuss schedule 9 next week. However, the Government's consultation document made it clear that our intention was to give a full reduction of 25 per cent. where the second adult in a household was on income support: that remains our position.

The Opposition have not thought through the amendments. They contradict each other, they would place single people in an unfair position and I ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any visitors to the Committee and members of the Committee will be struck by the sepulchral tones in which the debate was conducted before dinner compared to the present ebullient tone. There is a remarkable atmosphere of excitability and volubility on the Conservative Benches. It gives us an insight into how legislative disasters such as the poll tax are perpetrated. Hon. Gentlemen in their cups are immune to the considerations of good legislation. [HON. MEMBERS: "Order!"]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until now, Conservative Members have been tongue-tied and confused. They appeared to lack knowledge, and to be clueless and leaderless, but they have been transformed by a two-hour dinner break into a rabble of roaring—I was going to say lions, but roaring rabbits is more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That went down well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the sensibilities of hon. Gentlemen are somewhat blunted, so they may not appreciate the point. I hope that we can now deal with this serious matter, because Conservative Members have not given it much serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tried to express the criterion of fairness, but not to articulate or explain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Darks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is clearly discomfited by the opposition to his amendments. Rather than draw the conclusion that there may be something inherently wrong with the substance of his amendments, he prefers—albeit subtly—to cast aspersions on Conservative Members. He referred to "hon. Gentlemen in their cups", which is a somewhat prejudicial remark. Is it in order, Mr. Leadbitter, to use such an inference against members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that was an intervention, not a point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Gentleman: the point got through to him after a delay of five minutes. It seems to have had some effect, because he has addressed the Committee in more measured terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More soberly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggests that I use the term "soberly", but that may be tempting fate. The hon. Gentleman addressed the Committee in more measured terms than he did a few minutes ago. I congratulate him on reacting to the message.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that in the Minister's summary he suggested—in a throw-away fine—that all would be revealed when we came to debate schedule 9? Until then, those who will be subjected to the effects of the Bill will apparently not know whether they will be in receipt of benefit or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right; and it adds to the problems faced by local government in trying to prepare appropriate software and to make necessary administrative arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we shall get to the schedule next week, I cannot see that there is much of a delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That again provides insight into how these disasters come about. From the viewpoint of local government, one could take a different view about a further delay of another week, which is a serious matter—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry, Mr. Leadbitter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my hon. Friend's fault. It is the fault of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), the man who proves that he cannot cope with a happy hour for more than two hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position was made clear by the Under-Secretary when he asked us to delay further response to the Government's proposals until schedule 9. That would be acceptable if the Minister of State had made no further statement on the issues that we are debating. The reality is that we are faced with a Bill. The Minister has not taken the opportunity to refute comments made in the article to which reference has been made, but he has made it clear how serious the implications are for the poorest people in our community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The laughing and joking that has gone on here can relieve the tension after hours and we are all capable of it—myself included—but the clause affects the livelihood of our poorest people and it is just not good enough for the Under-Secretary to say that all will be revealed, so we should wait for next week. It is all the more appalling because the Minister of State is prepared to divulge to chosen journalists outside the Committee comments about the very issue that we are debating. The Committee is entitled to a detailed statement about what precisely is going on in discussions between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Security about the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. I notice that the Minister of State is present and will have heard what my hon. Friend said. I am the last person to accuse him of shirking his responsibilities as I have a high regard for him. He works very hard, but am I right in assuming that so far he has not risen to speak in today's proceedings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I should be very willing to give way to the Minister if he can respond to my hon. Friend's point. I see that that seems unlikely, and I am sure that the Committee will be disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's refusal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister could say whether the text of the article is right or wrong. He would only have to say one word. Then at least the Committee would have some view of what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that my hon. Friend's intervention suggests a rather unfortunate interpretation of the episode. As professional politicians, we all understand that if we are misreported, we can hardly restrain ourselves from the first opportunity to say so. We get up say things like "No, I was misreported; that was not what I meant to say". At the very least, one would expect an assurance that a report was inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
I see from the fact that the Minister is pursuing another piece of paper that that is not his position. We can conclude only that the report was accurate, which lends considerable weight to the complaint of my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield about information being divulged to journalists which has not been vouchsafed to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is competent to offer the information that we seek. I know that he has ambitions of various sorts, and I can see how prompt he is to step forward into the Minister's shoes. One day he might find himself in that position. But can he answer our question whether the Minister was reported accurately and say what arrangements the Government are making for rebates in these important categories? If the Minister can answer these questions, I shall gladly give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way instead to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend was speaking and since the Under-Secretary of State for Wales resumed his seat, I looked through schedule 9. I have to say that the Minister is palming off the Committee. I cannot read that quickly but I scanned the schedule and could not find anything that explained what the Minister was talking of. I think that he is hoping that some time next week the guillotine procedure will result in the schedule not being debated. There will then be no explanation. It would be better if the Minister gave us an explanation tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We are stacking up a series of unfortunate experiences because the guillotine is precluding debate on important issues that happen to have been forced to the back of the queue in accordance with the Government's timetable. This is unfortunate. I have not checked whether schedule 9 is a part of the Bill that brings up the rear in this way and which we might expect not to be debated properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is the guillotine procedure and the fact that in the article that has been quoted it is clear that the Minister has changed his position since the consultations with local authorities took place. We have asked several questions in Committee and have been told that social security legislation will introduce changes and that the precise nature of the changes is still being discussed. This answer was given to me yet again today when the Under-Secretary answered some of my questions. Either the article is wrong and the Minister should distance himself from it or the Minister is misleading the Committee and preventing our discussing the regulations as they will be, and the impact of the Bill. That is what the article reveals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it would be simple for the Minister to rise to say yes or no about whether the report entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"U-turn on benefits 'threatens poor'"</p></blockquote>
is wrong, and say whether he intends to make changes. Again he remains immobile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The timetable motion does not mention schedule 9. Along with 17 clauses and about five schedules,
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
and the debate on whether councillors should be allowed to vote, the schedule is to be debated on the morning of Thursday of next week until 8 pm, when consideration of the Bill in Committee will end. That is where schedule 9 is placed. If the Minister considers that that is proper debate of such an important subject, then as my hon. Friend said his attitude is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has shown that some of our fears may be well founded. It looks as though we may find ourselves trying to reach a debate on schedule 9 and the important issues that it raises during the final sitting of the Committee, when we do not have sufficient time to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be yet another grievous injury done by the Government's timetable motion to what we hope might become better legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has had ample opportunity to say whether the report is accurate but has not taken it. My hon. Friend is right in saying that the implication is worrying. Has he read the first paragraph, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Government U-turn on the shape of council tax benefits could create new poverty traps in the system that will hit pensioners and others on low incomes".</p></blockquote>
If the article is accurate, the Government know that it will hit pensioners and people on low incomes and create poverty traps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our experience as politicians is that if we are wrongly reported in such a damaging fashion, we rush to correct the report. The fact that the Minister has not corrected it suggests one of two things, the first being that he believes the report to be right. He may not necessarily want it to be right, but he has been caught out and cannot deny it. Secondly, and what is even more worrying, is this exactly what he wants the message to be? That message is contained in the article, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Government U-turn on the shape of council tax benefits could create new poverty traps in the system that will hit pensioners and others on low incomes".</p></blockquote>
This is a very damaging report and it beggars belief that the Minister is not prepared to comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first thing that I shall say is that I have not read the report. Secondly, when I heard it read by the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), it seemed to consist in unequal parts of quotations from me and speculation from the journalist. The speculation sounded wrong and implausible, while the quotations sounded largely correct and were also consistent with what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, who is replying to the debate, has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be happy to go into this matter on another occasion when I have read the report, but I hope that my comments have been helpful. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will realise that the part of the article which he has read is a piece of speculation and is in no sense attributed to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the Minister on breaking his duck for the day. It is an achievement, on his part and on ours, to have persuaded him to intervene. I think that the hon. Gentleman has been passed a copy of the report, so he may shortly be able to read it and comment further. None of us thought that the article's opening paragraph was a direct quote from the Minister. However, as it is a comment on what the Minister said, it is all the more important that he should in turn comment on it, and I am glad that he has done so. I regret only that the comment was so uninformative. I hope that having
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
read the report, the Minister can be induced to tell us in what respects the report is wrong. Will he also tell us when he expects to come forward with some detail on the matter, or is he content to rest, as his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales appears to be, on the complacent assumption that another week's delay is neither here nor there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most damaging parts of the report are those in quotations, particularly the section which indicates that even if someone were entitled to a rebate of 100 per cent. because of his or her income, the Government would provide another hoop for that individual to go through and the right to benefit would be calculated not necessarily on his or her income levels but on those of someone else in the property with whom there may nor may not be a direct involvement. That is the major problem. The Government are giving the public the impression that people on low incomes will receive 100 per cent. rebate, but if those people live in a property with someone else, whether independent of them or not, that other person's income will determine their right to benefit. That is an incredible admission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I think that by now the Minister has read the report and is indicating that he wishes to comment on it. There are passages in the report that are both comment and direct quotation, and those passages point to the same conclusion—that the income of other members of the household might reduce or even remove the entitlement to benefit of those who are on income support. I am sure that the Minister will want to comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now have four hon. Members waiting to intervene of whom the hon. Gentleman is the fourth. I shall give way to each of them in turn, first to my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister must read the report before he can give his considered response, but he can respond straight away to the second paragraph, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Local Government Minister, this week gave the clearest indication yet that the Government was to ditch its initial, and highly convoluted proposals for benefits under the new system."</p></blockquote>
What was wrong with the initial system? Why did the Government get it so wrong in the first place that it seems that it will now have to be ditched? Will the Minister answer that question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will answer that series of questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been alleged that the most damaging thing that I said was
	<br><blockquote><p>"You then need to take into account what happens if there is … a person living there who could contribute to the bill".</p></blockquote>
Only in deep ignorance or, possibly from an unwitting will to mislead could anyone make that comment, because my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales dealt with that point extremely clearly a few moments ago. I think that he said—certainly, if he read his brief he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have always made it clear that the benefit arrangements will broadly follow the system that already applies in other income-related benefits. We do consider that
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
it is right in principle that non-dependant adults sharing a property with a liable person, who is entitled to council tax benefit, should make a contribution to the council tax bill. The details of these arrangements will be a matter for regulations and further announcements will be made shortly. The Committee will be well aware that there is already a system of non-dependant deductions in housing benefit, and similar arrangements applied under rate rebates."</p></blockquote>
The last point which was skilfully made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary leads me to think that Opposition Members are not being honest with themselves or, unwittingly, are not being honest with the Committee. Opposition Members have a wealth of experience and they know that non-dependant deductions apply to other benefits and were applied to rate rebates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the report, I note that I am quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So I see it as being no more complicated than the rates, as what we are proposing now is something very much simpler than the document that was put into the public domain back in September. We are considerably simplifying our proposals from that point."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand why the Opposition are making a fuss. It is clear that the Government wish to come up with a simple system. Opposition Members, who are supposed to be in favour of administrative simplicity, have been pleading that cause throughout the debate. Allegedly, the most damaging part of the quotation is the proposal that we should apply to the proposed benefits the same rules that were applied to rates and other income-related benefits. I apologise for intervening at such length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that we have no complaint about the length of his intervention. I fully understand his doubts about whether he heard what his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales said and whether his hon. Friend actually said it. Given the state of the Committee at that time, precisely what was said and what was heard is uncertain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, what the Minister said leaves us less than entirely convinced or satisfied. My hon. Friends are keen to say—I shall give way in a moment to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle)—that the Minister seems to be adhering to a statement that those on income support could actually be reduced to a level of income below that of income support. That would be an extraordinary innovation and I cannot believe that that is what the Government intend. Does the Minister accept that people on income support are living at a Government-defined level of poverty below which they must not be allowed to fall? Does he seriously suggest that their rights to rebates should be reduced by other considerations so that their situation is worsened even by comparison with their entitlement to income support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister persists in insisting on what he is reported as saying in the article—that people are entitled to 100 per cent. rebates if they are on income support, but that the Government might then
	<br><blockquote><p>"need to take into account what happens if there is … a person living there who could contribute to the bill"—</p></blockquote>
that changes the whole basis of the social security system. The bottom line of that system is income support, which is means-tested. People's economic circumstances are examined exhaustively before they receive income support. If they qualify for income support, they will be entitled to a 100 per cent. rebate. Is the Minister saying that those people should have their income support reduced after it has been means-tested? That adds a new dimension to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
means-testing. It will mean that people on income support have been means-tested according to their neighbours, not according to their own circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their neighbours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the biblical sense of "Love thy neighbour".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West makes a powerful point. I do not detect—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I fear that the effects of a good dinner are again breaking out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the hon. Gentleman's excuse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not need one. The excuse is owed to the Committee by the Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hubbub engulfed my remarks, I was saying that the Minister of State showed no sign of rising to respond to the powerful point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West. That is a bad sign. Does the Minister agree with my hon. Friend, or is he waiting for further advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) was so preposterous that I scarcely felt any need to answer it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West misunderstood on two points. First, we are talking about reducing not income support but council tax benefit—the amount that is payable to somebody to pay the council tax. As the council tax is a tax payable on property with a personal element, it makes sense that we should not give benefits to someone to pay 100 per cent. of the tax if someone else living in the house could contribute. Secondly, we are talking not about neighbours but about members of the same household. If the Opposition are seriously suggesting that, if a millionaire were living with someone on income support, no account should be taken of that fact in giving the council tax benefit, they are even more stupid than I believed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The millionaire would not get income support, you fool!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is going too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proceedings since 9 pm have shown the difficulties that occur when the Minister persists in saying that he has nothing more to add to what he now appears to be saying was a misleading report. If that is the implication, I wish that he would bring the regulations forward so that we might have some idea of what they say. I give way to the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to jump the queue from fourth to third. It is clear that my hon. Friend the Minister has explained the Government's proposals, which in essence do not differ from the way that housing benefit was calculated and awarded under the rates. How would the Labour party's fair rates system differ? Would the calculation of housing benefit for the individual differ, if so, how?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basic point made by my hon. Friends is that, when a calculation has been made about entitlement to income support, entitlement has been established and a 100 per cent. rebate has been agreed, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
is odd for Ministers to say that that calculation can be redone for the purpose of establishing the level of benefit. That is the peculiarity of what has been said. The matter could be quickly resolved if Ministers produced the regulations to show us exactly what they intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, under his fair rates proposals, if one individual in a household is entitled to income support and therefore to housing benefit, there is no need for a contribution from anyone else in that household if he or she is well above the level of income support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to understand the unnecessary complexities introduced into what should be a straightforward property-based tax by the Government's insistence on treating some aspects of the present tax as personal tax. It is because the Government insist that there is a personal element that they—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have accepted that, now answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There can be no comparison of the two propositions because they are two quite separate taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, why, under the rating law—rates being a tax on property—were there non-dependant deductions on rate rebates? If the hon. Gentleman argues that they arise only because of the personal element of this tax, why did they exist under the rating system? The question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans), is fair because if such deductions arose under rating and also under housing benefit, how can the hon. Gentleman claim that they would not arise under his property tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me frame the question in a different way. A report says that the Minister is proposing a substantial change in his policies and in the proposals on which he has been consulting. He has not said whether that report is true. Will these changes be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman a straightforward question: has he a clue what is going on? Does he understand the topic? If he does, he should be able to answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is designed to explore the Government's proposals.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the Committee is in the business of looking at the Government's proposals, however, by putting forward amendments and alternatives, the Opposition also put themselves under the microscope of scrutiny. I ask the hon. Gentleman a direct question: does he propose, under the council tax or his own fair rates system, that in a household where one individual is on income support, no one else in the household on a higher income should pay council tax or rates? Is that what the hon. Gentleman proposes, yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman's question is: since we first privately circulated to local authority associations for consultation some proposals on how we might handle benefit, have we decided that we should try a simpler approach in response to those associations' representations? If that is the hon. Gentleman's question, the answer is yes. Will he now answer all our questions, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be satisfied by that answer, but I wonder why the report—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait until 10 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no interest in 10 o'clock. I am happy for the Division to take place before or after that time—it makes no odds to me. Will the Minister say why the report quoted him directly on the subject of the changes that he was supposed to be contemplating? The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You then need to take into account what happens if there is … a person living there who could contribute to the bill, and therefore had to be taken into account in assessing the support available to the person making the claim."</p></blockquote>
Is the hon. Gentleman saying that that does not represent, in any sense, a change from an earlier position? In that case, why does he suspect that the sentence is quoted as if it were of such significance? Does he have an answer to that question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of having made no change. As we had non-dependant deductions under rate rebates and have them under other income-related benefits and housing benefit, I never dreamt of not having them under council tax benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us in what respect the report suggests that he is about to change his policy?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads the report carefully, he will see that what it purports to represent as my change of position is that I propose something very much simpler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I propose is that a single person within a household should be able to make a single declaration as the liable person which would determine his eligibility for council tax benefit. That is much simpler than what was proposed in some documents which were discussed in the public press because they were leaked from our private consultations. As I read it, the article does not imply that I have made any change on non-dependant deductions. It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman did not pick that up. If he had realised that it exists in the present system, and has existed since the year dot, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) would have briefed him before the debate and have saved him much embarrassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could have saved the Committee much time if the Minister had deigned to get to his feet at the outset to assure us that that was what he had intended to say and that that is what the report should have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the debate. The article also suggested that whereas the original
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
proposals allowed for a rebate of up to 25 per cent. on a taper it is now to be a straight 25 per cent. on a flat rate. Perhaps my hon. Friend will ask the Minister to clarify that confusion, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will gladly do so. Perhaps this time the Minister is prepared to get to his feet to help us rather than sitting quietly for 20 minutes and being a dog in the manger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Gentleman means. I have stood up about half a dozen times. As the hon. Lady will observe, the article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will now almost certainly be dropped, and may now be replaced by a flat-rate 25 per cent. reduction".</p></blockquote>
There is no implication that I said any such thing; there is no attempt to attribute it to me. Moreover, I notice that the operative word is "may". It is the merest speculation; it has no connection with anything that I have said and so there is no reason why the Committee should believe it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making progress. I take what the Minister has just said as being the nearest that he is likely to come to a denial of the report's accuracy. Again, it would have been extremely helpful—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was said 10 minutes ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is the first time that the Minister has indicated that the report is inaccurate. Had he said that at the outset, we could have saved ourselves much time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman now tell us whether he would have non-dependant deductions under his rebate system for the rates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me now pass on to our amendments. Our system of rebates would have a starting point very different from the mess proposed by the Government by way of the council tax. We have no doubt that we would pick up the existing rebates scheme and extend it as we have said in "Fair Rates" and by way of illustration in our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock suggested that the amendments were peculiar because they were mutually inconsistent. I do not know whether he had worked that out, but that seemed to be his implication. I do not know how many Committees the hon. Gentleman has served on, but it is not unknown for the Opposition to table a series of amendments, not all of which are perfectly drafted or are necessarily consistent with each other, to illustrate different ways in which the same objective might be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He spent all his speech, apart from its final two sentences, making a point which I answered earlier which my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo), the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities, also dealt with in an intervention. The fact that the hon. Gentleman can spend 40 minutes making one point, and two sentences discussing his amendment, suggests that he has little confidence in it.

It is ironic that in one breath the hon.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to provide local authorities with some discretion on the 50
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
per cent. discount for unoccupied dwellings. We have had experience of the Government's attitude to such principles in our previous discussion, and during a previous sitting the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Bennett) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>'When we consulted on our proposals for the council tax, we said that any property that was subject to a standard community charge multiplier of zero should be exempted from the council tax. I confirm that that is still our intention."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 20 November 1991; c. 175.]</p></blockquote>
Properties that are zero rated for poll tax will automatically be exempt from council tax. The poll tax legislation provides discretion for vacant properties to be subject to a multiplier of one half, one, one and a half, or twice the personal poll tax if they are not a sole or main residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position under the Bill of other domestic properties which are unoccupied and which attract the other multipliers under the poll tax legislation? We have been told that according to the principle of zero rating, such properties are automatically exempt from charges under the Bill. Will the Minister describe the situation for properties that come under the rest of that formula?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should have some discretion when considering empty properties to which the zero rating applies automatically. Amendment No 99 would apply that discretion by leaving out line 21 of clause 11, in which subsection (2) states that the discount will be equal to twice the appropriate percentage—that is, twice 25 per cent., or 50 per cent.—if there is no resident in the dwelling. We believe that that is too open and that local authorities should have more discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of the need for more discretion. The Committee will know that when we were discussing what constituted a sole and main residence I referred to the case involving the Bradford metropolitan council. The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) raised a point about fishermen, merchant seamen and people on oil rigs. The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment agreed that he would write to the hon. Gentleman and that all members of the Committee would receive a copy of that letter. I gave the example of Mr. Terry Waite, who has recently been released from captivity, and said that he could have been greeted with a bill for two years' poll tax if his local authority had been unable to act with discretion in his case. However, because his local authority was able, under the poll tax legislation, to exercise discretion, it was able to ensure that Mr. Waite did not receive a poll tax bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given such a precedent, the present Bill should contain similar powers of discretion for local authorities. Under the old rating system, local authorities were able to exercise discretion in the application of 5 per cent. to 10 per cent. over and above the statutory amount of discount or rebate that was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities must have some discretion in the collection of local taxes and in the application of local principles that are acceptable to local people. They do have discretion on the standard community charge for empty properties that are not specified by the Secretary of State. Second homes fall into that category. Local authorities obeyed the Department of the Environment in charging the maximum standard charge—involving a multiplier of two—on such homes. It was because of that that the Secretary of State introduced amendments to the poll tax legislation to allow discretion in the application of the multipliers that I have already described—zero, half,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
one, one and a half or twice the community charge. That applied to second homes. The amendments take up that principle and give local authorities the discretion to withhold the 50 per cent. discount if the authority wishes. There should be a balance between those who can afford to pay and those who cannot. If people have second homes for holiday or weekend use and can afford the services supplied to them, there is no reason to give them the 50 per cent. discount, but that is a matter for local authorities to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation document issued by the Department of the Environment "A New Tax for Local Government", the Government say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all properties impose costs on local authorities whether they are continuously occupied or not. This is true of second homes and houses occasionally let. Such houses require protective services, highways, refuse collection, planning and many other services."</p></blockquote>
So if a person can afford to pay the full tax on the second home, he should not be given a concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the previous group of amendments the Under-Secretary of State for Wales said that we should target resources to people who need assistance. There is nothing wrong with that, but if that principle applied when considering previous amendments, surely it is difficult for the Minister to say that it should not apply to these amendments. Opposition Members maintain that those who can afford to pay should pay their full contribution to local services and that those who have difficulty in paying should be given some relief. The matter should be left to the discretion of the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee received a letter from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy dated 18 November in which there was reference to the principles embodied in clause 11. CIPFA says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provision in the Bill for the Secretary to amend 'the appropriate percentage' will have implications in a number of areas and there is a need to ensure that there is a date after which an Order cannot be made to take effect at the beginning of a financial year."</p></blockquote>
So CIPFA believes that local authorities should have some discretion. The briefing note continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An order made under subsection (3) above shall not be valid unless it is made on or before the 31 March in the financial year before the year preceding the year in which the charge is to take effect."</p></blockquote>
Unless local authorities know what the situation will be in the coming year, they will not be able to carry out all their functions. The amendment will assist CIPFA and many local authorities and local authority associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Revenue support grant compensates for differences between the resources and needs of authorities so that all local authorities can levy the same council tax for spending money on assessed needs. The resources base will be adjusted by discounts to make that calculation. The resources element of the support grant should be adjusted on the basis of the number of discounts that are granted. The Minister should clarify who pays for the 50 per cent. discounts that are granted for empty properties. Will the money be taken from the resources element of the support grant, or from other charge payers in the area? In the past, those discounts had to be self-financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The resources element of the support grant should be adjusted to ensure that taxpayers are not charged for concessions on other people's second homes. If an
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
authority spends more than the standard spending assessment, it will receive no compensation for discounts. The authority has no influence over the amount of discounts that it pays, yet it will be penalised if it spends more than the SSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other taxpayers in the community will pay for the additional spending on empty properties if local authorities spend more than the SSA. In areas where second homes proliferate, many applications for discounts will be granted, and the marginal costs of increased spending to council tax payers will be greater than in areas where there are no second homes. Local authorities should be given the discretion to overcome such a predicament. The billing authorities should be allowed to decide whether to grant discounts for second homes. The cost of second home ownership for the local authorities should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation is a professional body and has dealt with local taxation since 1882. It has a wide membership drawn from the valuation and local authority revenue professions. It states in a letter to its members:
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(1) Notwithstanding the quite separate argument that Council Tax will be the only local tax available to local authorities, the main debate on the proposals set out in the Bill have to be focused on collectability.</li>
	<li>(2) Collectability of a tax depends upon a number of factors, some or all of which can affect quite markedly the collectability of a local tax".</li></div> <!-- ul -->
The IRRV lists five worrying aspects:
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"The ease with which liability can be positively established;</li>
	<li>Workable appeal provisions;</li>
	<li>The public's perception of fairness in any 'relief schemes;</li>
	<li>The effectiveness of a benefits scheme; and</li>
	<li>The certainty and effectiveness of recovery powers."</li></div> <!-- ul -->
I imagine that all hon. Members will agree with those five principles, so the reference that is made to the Committee by the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation should be considered seriously. The IRRV continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is important to bear all of these factors in mind when examining the Bill in detail, in order to ensure that the resultant local government finance system is easy to implement and capable of being sustained in the long term."</p></blockquote>
It then refers to discounts in particular:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Turning to the main thrust of the Government's policy aim to determine the size of the household bill by the number and status of the residents, aspects of the proposed use of discounts, transitional protection and council tax benefits give rise to some concerns.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The public will recognise clearly the arbitrary way in which both the Discounts and Protection are awarded without any regard to the ability-to-pay. It should be borne in mind that over the last two and half years the public perception of fairness has been heightened and it should not be ignored if major changes to the new tax after implementation are to be avoided.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Ability to pay cannot be measured by the number of residents within the house. A sole resident on generous earnings would attract a 25 per cent. discount while a married couple in a similar 'Banded' house with the wife not working and the couple being just above the threshold for qualifying for benefit would be required to pay the full tax.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Already 'status' discounts are not understood and these will breed further confusion in the minds of the public. 25 per cent. discounts on households bills are given to sole residents at least 18 years of age or where there are 2 or more residents, where all but one are 'disregarded' ie. have status discounts.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Double discounts are to be given where all residents have status discounts or where the dwelling is devoid of 'residents'
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
even although the house may be furnished. A house in course of sale would be liable for the same tax as a similarly 'banded' second-home.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Institute feels that double discounts should not apply to properties which are in the course of being sold."</p></blockquote>
The IRRV subscribes to our view that local authorities should use discretion in applying the discounts to empty properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another question for the Minister. We are told that one category of property which it is proposed to exempt from the council tax are properties that have been taken into possession by a mortgage lender. I assume that a building society or bank that repossesses a property will be exempt from the council tax. What about the house that a person wants to sell privately? That person may have no mortgage with a building society or a bank. It could be a house that he inherited from a deceased relative or he could be selling it because of his economic circumstances. Do I take it that because property that has been repossessed by a building society or a bank will be exempt from the council tax any house or property that is being offered for sale will therefore be exempt? Will the Minister clarify whether a house offered for sale by a private vendor will be exempt from the council tax in the same way as a property taken in possession by a mortgage vendor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.00 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have previously raised the issue of inherited properties with the Minister. I received short shrift about the case of two minors aged 15 and 16 who inherit a property on the death of a grandparent. The Minister made it clear that minors in such circumstances would not be exempt from the council tax unless the property was sold or put up for rent. That is not the case for building societies, which turn people out on to the street and leave the local authority to pick up the tab for alternative accommodation under homelessness legislation. Building societies are left with an asset and do not have to contribute towards the council tax, while the council has to provide alternative accommodation for people who have lost their housing because of the society's actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. I know a couple who could not meet their mortgage payments and surrendered their mortgage to the building society. The building society did not act on the surrendered mortgage even though the couple had moved out. The couple therefore has to pay a full 12 months poll tax bill because the property was still registered in their name. If a house is vacant and ready for sale, the principle of exemption for building societies and banks from charges should be extended to the sort of couples that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) have mentioned.

Local authorities must have some discretion in these matters. What about the properties of prisoners, detainees, hospital patients, those in care and care workers that are unoccupied without limit of time? Those categories of people qualify for exemption under the principle of the council tax. I shall consider prisoners and detainees, who will be exempt under the Bill. However, in our discussion a few days ago—it seems a few days ago, but it must be last week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was probably this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could have been. In fact it was on 21 November. We raised the matter then. I asked the Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If what the Minister says is correct, we must consider who is liable for rented premises. When a property is empty, the person responsible for the charge according to the legislation is not the resident but the owner. Yet the Minister has just said that the onus of paying the charge will be on the resident. That is not the whole picture because the Bill provides that, if premises are empty, the owner is responsible for two charges, less 25 per cent in each case. Will the Minister qualify what he said earlier and explain the Bill?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A prisoner who continues to own a property can be liable for the council tax on it. If there are residents in the property they will be liable, for the council tax. If the property is empty he will be liable. I cannot imagine why prisoners who own unoccupied property should be exempt from the tax. I do not know if that was what the hon. Gentleman was suggesting, but if it was, I disagree with him."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 21 November 1991; c. 306.]</p></blockquote>
I was suggesting that the legislation specifies that prisoners are exempt from payment. The Minister cannot have it both ways. We must surely accept that the legislation states that property belonging to a person who is in detention is exempt, but the Minister says that that does not apply because if a person has property and is in prison, he should make payment. The Minister must clarify the position; we must accept either what the Minister states or what the legislation states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities must have discretion because they are more aware of the position regarding second homes and people on remand. If people can afford to pay, they should. There is no reason for not considering our amendments. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales said that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) took 25 minutes on the report that was discussed at length in connection with the previous group of amendments, but it took the Minister 25 minutes to reply to the question. I was pleased that my hon. Friend pursued the issue because if he had not, we should never have known what was intended or why the Minister made the points that he did during his interview.

The final paragraph of the magazine article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Income support as a cut off could be tough on some pensioners. The difference between entitlement and non-entitlement could be a matter of pennies, and it's bound to create lots of losers."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, discretion should be given to local authorities to ensure that people cannot lose benefit because of "pennies". If local authorities do not have such discretion, we shall create greater hardship in communities.

The letter from RADAR and Mencap draws attention to clause 11 and suggests an insertion after line 17 on page 7 of the Bill. Obviously, that cannot be done at this stage, but the principle in the letter applies as much as our amendments do. The suggested insertion reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"line 17, insert '(c) there are two or more residents of the dwelling one of whom is a disabled person and one is his live-in carer who does not fall to be disregarded for the purposes of discount.'"</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This amendment is supported by RADAR and MENCAP. These organisations believe that disabled people who pay for a live-in carer should be classed as a single person household if that is what they would otherwise have been. Additional cost should not be imposed upon a household which is two-person rather than one-person not by choice but by necessity."</p></blockquote>
We believe that the local authority is best placed to provide the judgment that Mencap and RADAR seek.

If a person living alone develops a severe disability and needs a live-in carer, that person should not be disfranchised from discount because he needs someone to care for him in the dwelling. In reply to one of my colleagues, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said that no one should suffer under the proposals. The local authority should have discretion in the case of a single person living alone who develops a severe disability and needs a live-in carer. It should be able to act immediately—early action must be taken in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is sufficient proof that local authorities should have an influence over discounts. For example, they should have discretion as to whether a discount should be allowed for empty properties. Ministers have said that discounts would be administratively simple if the majority of those eligible failed to claim them. Ministers were asked how people would be notified of their eligibility and we were told in an earlier sitting that the eligible person would have to make a claim. Are discounts therefore merely a window-dressing exercise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will local authorities provide no information? We were told that local authorities could advertise the discounts if they wished. That is the only discretion that they have been given under the proposals discussed so far. Will they be compelled to publicise the availability of discounts? Will local authorities use only poll tax registers—we were told that they can and will do so—to award discounts automatically where a poll tax payer is shown as living singly or a property is vacant, or will other, more active steps be taken to notify people and award discounts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

How will local authorities be reimbursed for the administration costs of the discount scheme? I raised that matter earlier and I should like the Minister to clarify it. There are substantial reasons why local authorities should have discretion about which vacant properties qualify for discounts. The Minister should carefully consider the amendment and my questions and give the answers which I seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) about the discretion that local authorities should have in the application of discounts. I shall refer to the problem in Wales and in the whole country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made the good point that the rates system dealt fairly with empty properties. Under section 15 of the Local Government Act 1974, local authorities had wide discretionary powers. They could levy rates on empty properties at any proportion of the full rate up to 100 per cent. They could levy empty rating selectively on parts of a property and even on properties in certain parts of their areas. They could levy varying proportions of full rate on any of the different categories. Local authorities also had the power to reduce or remit the payment of empty rates on grounds of hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only flexibility on discounts that the Government will introduce applies to the Principality, because of the problem of second homes in Wales. When we debate clause 12, which is important, the Opposition will support its underlying principle. Various factors—the A55 has been built in north Wales, and the M4 has been extended in south Wales—have meant that many Welsh-speaking communities have been particularly affected by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
problem of second homes. All responsible politicians in Wales look for a solution to it. Planning permission might be one solution, but unquestionably another is the rating of empty properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh district councils, which will be responsible for implementing the council tax in Wales, dealt with the matter in their evidence to the Secretary of State. The Council of Welsh Districts supports the proposal that all domestic properties should be taxed. It stated that the relevant rules and regulations governing second homes and empty properties that applied, as the council put it, to the tried and trusted rates system should apply to the new council tax. As a consequence, furnished second homes in Wales would be liable for the full property tax. Empty properties would be subject to the 50 per cent. charge at the discretion of councils, as previously applied in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that the Welsh districts made was that the rating system allowed our local authorities to consider the problems in their own areas and come to decisions and conclusions. My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton said that that principle would be of great benefit throughout the United Kingdom and not only in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), I wish to ask a few questions on amendments Nos. 171, 172 and 174. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, is not present because they relate specifically to problems in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply to the debate on clause 4, the Minister said that empty properties with a standard class multiplier of zero would be exempt from the council tax. I want to make certain that that applies in Scotland. I imagine that it does, but I should like confirmation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will properties with a standard class multiplier of a half or one be treated under the council tax in Scotland? I want to be certain that the intentions are precisely the same for England and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On second homes and how they are categorised, clause 11(2) 	<i>(a)</i> removes local authority discretion and imposes a 50 per cent. discount, and clause 79 has the same intention. Presumably the Minister intends that both of those provisions should apply throughout England, Scotland and Wales. The discount provides a subsidy for those who can afford a second home. I am curious to know whether owning a second home anywhere in Britain applies to second homes in Northern Ireland, which does not come under poll tax legislation and presumably will not come under council tax legislation. What provision is there for second homes in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second homes involve a cost to the local authority in which they lie. How will the loss incurred by Scottish local authorities due to the discount on second homes be made up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the English local authority system, if an authority spends above its SSA there will be no compensation for discounts. Scotland works to a different system of control of local authority spending and I am not clear about what will happen in Scotland if an authority spends above what the Government think is an appropriate level of spending. Will the Minister help me? I hope that he is well informed about the likenesses and the differences between Scotland and England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make some brief points although my hon. Friends have dealt with this matter extremely

	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
well, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien)—I was surprised that he did not mention garages. Clearly, he has thoroughly exhausted that point and forced the answers out of the Ministers. He has done an excellent job in dealing with the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would give billing authorities the discretion to grant the 50 per cent. discount for dwellings with no residents. Under the poll tax, a standard charge was payable with a multiplier of zero, one half, one, one and a half or two. The Secretary of State prescribed the classes and the maximum multiplier that the local authority could adopt in such cases. I assume that he will carry forward to the council tax the classes that he prescribed for the poll tax. On the whole, I agree with him, although I struggled with his predecessor to have carers included if their homes were unoccupied; finally, the Government saw the light. I welcome many of the provisions, but I have questions about a few of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the nil multiplier applies to properties undergoing structural repairs to render them habitable, but the documentation refers to less than six months having elapsed since the day on which the repair was substantially completed. Why is there that gap of six months? If a repair has been completed, why should the nil multiplier still apply? If the Crown leaves properties in class X empty and prohibits use of those properties, I do not understand why the nil multiplier should apply to them. Why should not the Crown pay the local authority? The local authority will lose income as a consequence of the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton touched on repossessions. When banks and building societies repossess properties, they do not have to pay the tax because the nil multiplier comes into operation. Again, the local authority loses out. I do not see why banks and building societies should not pay the local authority, once they have taken possession of a property. That would be an incentive for them to sell the property quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know from scrutinising the zero multiplier list that it includes prisoners. He will realise, therefore, that when, at column 306,1 said that a prisoner with an empty property would be liable for the council tax, either I was either teasing the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) or, possibly, I made a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has left me none the wiser. I just hope that the prisoner does not have a garage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) referred to second homes. For empty properties not specified by the Secretary of State, the local authority has the discretion to levy up to the standard charge. Clause ll(2)(a) removes the local authority's discretion and, instead, imposes a 50 per cent. discount. In effect, that provides a subsidy for rich people with second homes and must be to the disadvantage of local authorities. Most local authorities would charge at least a multiplier of one and collect the full rate. In their consultation paper, "A New Tax for Local Government", the Government said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all properties impose costs on local authorities whether they are continuously occupied or not. This is true of second homes and houses occasionally let. Such houses require protective services, highways, refuse collection, planning and many other services."</p></blockquote>
There is, therefore, a case for local authorities, if they wish, to charge the full amount for a second home rather than set the charge at 50 per cent. of the bill, which would be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
result of a discount being applied in those circumstances. The provision will subsidise the rich who own second homes. That is unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One element hidden among the mess of the poll tax was the Government's muddle on second homes. They did not know how to deal with them. Under the Scottish Bill, the multiplier was set at between one and two. The Secretary of State for Scotland then set a revenue support grant that was based on the assumption that local authorities set the multiplier at two. Each local authority in Scotland therefore set the multiplier at two, and we got into a mess.

My constituents include a pensioner couple who own a property in Millport on the island of Cumbrae consisting of a room, a kitchen and a shared toilet. It does not even have a shared bathroom. The rates on the house were £55 and, on that basis, the couple paid about £50. Under the poll tax, they had to pay double the charge set for that area and they found themselves suddenly having to pay £550 for the property. That was absurd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman agrees. That is why he says that the Government are changing the provision. They are changing it marginally for the benefit of such pensioner couples, whose bills will be reduced. The tenement buildings in Millport are under-developed. Recently, I visited the town to talk to officials of the local housing association who are trying to develop some of those houses. The properties are tiny; they have one room and a kitchen and are without a bathroom. They change hands for between £4,000 and £5,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is too much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is too much. Because the Government have not applied the banding system to properties in Scotland that are worth less than £27,000, those houses will fall into the same category as properties that are worth £27,000. I accept that the owners will be entitled to the 50 per cent. discount. But if the Government had never introduced a banding scheme and had gone for individual valuations—as we wished—those properties would be valued at £4,000 or £5,000 and the owners would pay the council tax rate accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the position of the Duke of Argyll. His main residence is in London, while his second home is Inverary castle, which is in the constituency of Argyll and Bute. To start with, the rate on that property cannot be set at more than three times the rate set for the property in Millport, which contains a single room and kitchen. However, it will be entitled to the 50 per cent. discount. Thus, the owners of the little house that is worth £3,000 or £4,000 will have to pay £100—half the original charge at the lowest level—while the owners of Inverary castle will pay £300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where on earth is the fairness in that? We should restore to local authorities the ability to examine second homes in their areas and classify them accordingly. I am not necessarily in favour of over taxing second homes. For that pensioner couple, their only holiday may be a week in the summer in that house, and that will be it. They will not get much more of a holiday throughout the year and it would be unfair to tax them on that pleasure. Equally, it would be grossly unfair to charge the Duke of Argyll only £300 on his house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

In that case, he will pay £600 or what amount is due on it as his sole or main residence. He will then be entitled to classify his large house in one of the most fashionable parts of London, which is probably worth £2 million or £3 million, as his second home and get a 50 per cent. discount on the amount charged on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members cannot have it both ways. The two homes cannot be classified as the sole and main residence of the owner who will pay the tax due on both.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people about whom the hon.

The Government simply do not understand that the best way to deal with second homes is the same as for first homes; individual valuations should be made on each property and rates charged accordingly. As they do not accept that basic principle, the Government are getting into the same mess with second homes as that in which they found themselves with the poll tax.

The hon. Member for Normanton always manages to fulfil an important role in Committee: to ensure that a proper airing is given to the suggestions, criticisms and worries of those outside and beyond the House, who write to members of the Committee. Sometimes it is the Opposition who seek to raise those issues, sometimes it is my hon. Friends. It is clearly important that all the issues are given serious consideration. I shall seek to do that, but the hon. Gentleman must have asked me in excess of 30 questions in quick succession. It is always a nightmare to see the hon. Gentleman rise with a sheaf of correspondence from outside bodies. I quake as I see it; my officials also quake; but we shall do our best. In the cold light of morning, I shall read what the hon. Gentleman had to say and I apologise in advance should I omit something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 99, 101, 171, 172 and 174 seek to remove the so-called double discount, equivalent to two personal discounts, for properties that are not used as a sole or main residence. The amendments would allow local authorities the discretion to set a multiplier of up to the amount of the full basic bill. Amendment No. 131 seeks to remove the double discount that is available where the property is not unoccupied but where all the residents are entitled to status discount—because, for instance, they are all youth training scheme trainees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton has raised the question of local authority discretion. Many hon. Members have spoken about the discretion, which has been a matter of dispute and concern for a long time, particularly under the community charge. From the volume of letters that I sign, I know that the issue causes much disquiet. From the letters sent to me by hon. Members on both sides of the House, I know that those affected by the discretion allowed to local authorities have by no means all been millionaires. Far from it; they are very much the exception. In my experience, only in a minority of cases are we talking of rich people with second homes in the country. One problem was that in practice local authorities did not use their discretion: they nearly all charged the maximum multiplier of two. It is fair and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
proper that empty properties should generally give rise to a council tax of 50 per cent. of the full bill—the property element of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton spoke about the representations made by the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation. I note what it says; many of the points raised have come elsewhere in our debates, or will come later. The IRRV, too, raised the question of discounts. Applying for discounts has not been a problem with the community charge. Formal notification is possible. Local authorities are not compelled to publicise discounts, but I assure the hon. Member for Normanton that there will be a national publicity campaign. Many local authorities will probably wish to run local campaigns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned administrative costs. They will be covered by the revenue support grant arrangements. We estimate that the administrative cost of the community charge across the country is about £500 million a year, whereas the cost of the council tax is about £200 million. That substantial saving should be welcome to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what happens to youths, those under 18 years old, who inherit property. A youth will be liable only as the owner of the property, not as the resident. If he lives in the property, he will not pay. The situation is different if he is the liable person because he owns the property but someone else lives there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) also referred to properties taken into possession by mortgage lenders. They will be exempt, as will all properties that currently qualify for a zero multiplier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister does not want to evade the question. I understand that when a property is repossessed by the building society or the bank it will be exempt under the new legislation, but will a vacant property that is sold privately by someone who has no mortgage be exempt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be six months' exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that apply to the mortgage lender?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not to the mortgage lender, but to the private sale of a property which is empty. I shall return to that matter as it arises on another issue mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the tax base point. The number of discounts to which council taxpayers are entitled, will be taken into account in the calculation of the tax base for RSG. Local authorities will be compensated for having a larger-than-average number of discounts. A local authority with many unoccupied properties will not be disadvantaged. It can spend at the standard spending assessment by levying the standard amounts of council tax. That applies to all areas. Of course the local authority will not be compensated if it spends above SSA. Additional spending would fall entirely on local taxpayers, which is fair and right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Empty properties that did not qualify for which multipliers of less than two were prescribed will qualify for a 50 per cent. discount and will thus benefit from a reduction in the council tax, which in most cases is equivalent to or more advantageous than the treatment under the standard community charge. Exceptions are those properties that had a half multiplier. There were two
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
such classes—property which was empty because the owner was living in job-related accommodation and empty property that could be occupied by agricultural workers. The cases were specific. Houses that are unoccupied and unfurnished awaiting sale will be exempt for six months. I hope that that clarifies the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It explains what is implied in the Bill, but I wanted to establish why a different approach is taken when a building society or bank has an empty house for sale. If it is empty and it takes 12 months to sell, the building society or bank pay no tax under the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a young couple had to move into rented accommodation and had their empty house on the market, they would be allowed six months to sell it: if they did not sell it within that period, they would pay tax afterwards. Is that what the Minister is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I now have the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Mortgage lenders will be exempt as long as the lender is in possession of the property. Private sellers have the six-month exemption, and mortgage lenders will too if they remain in possession. I hope that that finally answers the hon. Gentleman's question. If not, we could follow it up later. I am happy to explore the issue with the hon. Gentleman.

Various questions were asked about disabled people and carers. I know, Mr. Leadbitter, that those issues are covered in clause 13 and amendment No. 186 and paragraph 1 of schedule 9, but I fear that we may not get to them. In addition to the proposals for people with disabilities that were announced yesterday by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, which have been widely publicised and were worked out with RADAR and other groups, discussions are continuing and we are pursuing the relevant issues. The hon. Member for Normanton has taken up an important matter and we are discussing the issues that he has raised, though we have not yet reached a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that amendment No. 76—clause 5, line 24—was tabled last week and related to similar issues. I understand that a press release has been issued. I seek the assurance that there will be categoric help for people with disabilities. For example, property that is enlarged because of someone's disability, should not be charged a higher tax. The only way to achieve that help for disabled people would be to place their property in a lower band. Is that the Minister's intention? If so, it matches the amendment that we tabled last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If adaptations have been made, they will fall into a lower band. May I repeat an earlier comment to help clarify the issue. It is not a matter of the valuer deciding whether a person occupying a property is disabled and should be in a lower band. It is a straightforward valuation. An application is made to the local authority, which then decides. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question. If not, let us return to it later, but I am conscious of the clock as the guillotine must fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Use of the register to award discounts will be useful. It will be a helpful source of information to identify properties of the disabled. Moreover, authorities can use any other information in their possession to give householders the opportunity to request a discount.

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked about Scotland. Empty property will be treated in exactly the same way as in England. In Northern Ireland, people will pay the rates that are applicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman with the red braces, the hon. Member for Leyton, asked about Crown payments. Sometimes the Crown makes payment-in-lieu. For example, in the extraordinary possibility that No. 10 might stand empty, the Crown would pay. I dealt with repossessions earlier. We have dealt also with prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to provide for a discount of the council tax payable on homes that are no one's sole or main residence follows on logically from the decision to have a property-based tax with personal discounts. To provide otherwise would call into question the whole discount approach, which we regard as fundamental to the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know of one property on the island of Arran which is owned by a German couple. It is the only residence that they have in the United Kingdom, so does it become their sole and main residence here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It may not be their sole or main residence, but I imagine that they would wish to contribute, for the sake of European relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 131 would remove entitlement to a double discount. We see no justification for denying residents the double discount in such cases. We have said that certain groups will attract a discount; it follows that if all residents of a dwelling had a discount entitlement, the bills would reflect it and consist only of the 50 per cent. property element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) mentioned the special circumstances in Wales, which justify a different approach. If there were time, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales would speak to separate amendments on Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have covered all the points raised. If not, I shall try to make amends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before midnight strikes and the Under-Secretary turns into a pumpkin, will he tell us why it is fair for the Duke of Argyll to get away with paying so little when he owns two vast, extremely expensive homes? My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) used that example; there are many less dramatic instances but the phenomenon is commonplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In exactly the same way, if I trespass on the Committee's time any further, the hon. Lady will turn into my Cinderella.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of issues have arisen. I am glad that prisoners were mentioned and I hope that the Minister will not tease me any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have had two standard charges because the Secretary of State insisted that they levy the poll tax, including the standard charge, to the maximum. I shall not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 7, line 25, leave out '25' and insert '50'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 85, in clause 79, page 51, line 34, leave out '25' and insert '50'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to move amendment No. 81 because 27 per cent. of all people aged between 65 and 74 and 50 per cent. of all those over 75 are single, and it is extremely important that we consider them. Age Concern tells us that a single retired person has on average 60 per cent. of the income of a retired married couple, so is a 25 per cent. discount sufficient? In my view, it is not: 50 per cent. would be fairer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important because, under the rates, there was what became known as the widow factor. When the rates went, there was rejoicing in single households, especially those of elderly single ladies. We do not want to penalise those households again. The only way not to do so is to give them a worthwhile discount, which must be more than a miserly, insufficient 25 per cent. Retirement pension figures show that a single person's income is 62 per cent. that of a couple—£52 a week compared with £83·25 a week. A 25 per cent. discount is nowhere near enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1989 family expenditure survey of gross household income gives the figures for retired households mainly dependent on state benefits—£58·88 for a single person and £101·50 for a couple. A single person's income is 58 per cent. income of a couple's, so a 25 per cent. discount is nowhere near sufficient or fair. A much fairer figure would be nearer 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rebates under the Labour party's fair rates proposals will be nowhere near sufficient to cope with problems such as those that necessitated getting rid of the rates. The proposed discounts are also not sufficient to help elderly single people, a high proportion of whom live in my constituency of Eastbourne. I make no apology for pressing their case and for saying that they deserve a 50 per cent.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
