<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An extract from the third report of the 1991–92 Session of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has been placed on the Table at the request of the Joint Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I seek guidance about our proceedings tonight. Amendment No. 158 to schedule 4 refers to the provisions for distress in England. The amendments to the Scottish equivalent—warrant sales— should be discussed when schedule 8 is considered. Could the amendments be considered together, or will schedule 8 be lost through the operation of the guillotine?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason why the hon. Lady's useful suggestion should not be accepted, if that is convenient to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I do not necessarily oppose the suggestion. However, I tabled the amendments on warrant sales and it is a little harsh of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) to object to those amendments without consulting me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not object to the hon. Gentleman's amendments. Schedule 8 if part of the Bill and I asked whether the amendments to it could be discussed with the amendments to its English equivalent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments, but not the schedules can be taken together. I have taken account of the reasonable intervention of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I presume that the hon. Lady wishes the amendments to be grouped together to ensure that they are debated. Has the hon. Member for Cathcart anything further to say?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be possible to discuss the matter with the Clerk and the hon. Lady and return to it later?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee seeks to be co-operative. The hon. Gentleman has made a constructive suggestion. He can inform the Chair of his decision later.</span></p>

Schedule 2</div> <!-- schedule -->

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ADMINISTRATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment moved [this day]:</i> No. 134, in page 83, line 39, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(ba) regulations under this Schedule made in accordance with paragraph 2(b) above shall provide that, where a liable person so requests, payments on account shall be accepted at weekly or fortnightly intervals;'. —<i>[Mr. Bellotti.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The House is probably the only place in the world where one day I can speak rapidly to get 600 or 700 words into a minute and a half, and on the following day, I can be offered a three-and-a-half hour break during a 10 minute speech. However, I am thankful for the break. I hope that you, Mr. Leadbitter, enjoyed it as much as the other members of the Committee did.<br><br>
The Committee was considering weekly and fortnightly payments. I said that recent evidence shows that the highest non-payment of poll tax is in areas of high benefit dependence, and, therefore, of low income. This link has been clearly established by local authorities and voluntary organisations.<br><br>
It is important that people who are invited to make payments make them from income. If they are receiving income weekly or fortnightly, it is easier to make payments weekly or two-weekly. When payments and income do not match, difficulties occur. A person who is being pressed to make monthly payments with only a weekly income often finds that difficult in the week of the demand. Monthly payments for people on low pay are not only difficult, they are inappropriate. Similarly, there is no reason why everyone who is paid monthly should pay council tax weekly. Payment times should vary. People who receive a weekly wage or fortnightly income are more likely to pay immediately from this income if they have an exact figure rather than a calculation or an amount to put away for later in the month.<br><br>
Local authority practice in collecting poll tax is interesting because it will be relevant to collection of council tax. Kirklees council introduced community charge weekly payment scheme and this has resulted in a marked improvement in its rate of collection. Winchester council has also agreed to collect community charge payments with council rents, which has helped to keep payment regular. Unfortunately, the vast majority of local authorities will accept payment only on a monthly basis. Therefore many who might have been encouraged to pay regularly have difficulties and have discovered that their local authority is not friendly towards the customer.<br><br>
To give the Committee an idea of the magnitude of the problem, I offer a statistic from the citizens advice bureaux. Between February and May 1990, CABs dealt with 1,394 inquiries about problems with paying the community charge and a further 1,558 inquiries over methods of payment. This demonstrates that a sizeable problem exists and that we ought to encourage local authorities to deal with it.<br><br>
If we gave weekly and fortnightly payments the same status as monthly payments, we would provide councils with great stimulus to arrange such schemes for payment.<br><br>
The Committee no doubt agrees that local authority practices should be tailored to meet the needs of the people. If the Government wish to encourage payment and avoid debt, they will support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's motives although I cannot support his amendment and do not expect the Minister to accept it as drafted. But I hope that my hon. Friend will respond to its underlying sound common sense.<br><br>
I acknowledge the problems that the hon. Gentleman illustrated. Approximately 38,000 households in the city of Nottingham are still owned and managed by the local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0304">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
authority and 6,700 are owned and managed by housing associations. Probably about 50 per cent, of all households in my city are in the public sector.<br><br>
I certainly do not want the Bill to confer the general right to demand weekly payments. That may sound very well, but in practice it would be an enormous imposition on local authorities, housing associations and private landlords. As the local authority has to deal with some private landlords, the system could easily become a headache.<br><br>
Hon. Members are well aware of the traditional 50-week year for local authorities. Many housing associations also operate on that basis and have fortnightly rental arrangements. I hope that the Minister will accept that such fortnightly payments will be in order under the new tax. Accepting the first premise, fortnightly council tax collection should also be in order for local authorities and housing associations provided they list it separately.<br><br>
I would not wish to return to the old days when rates, heating charges and other bits and pieces were buried in the rent. But so long as it is made clear in the rent book, tenants should be able to pay on the fortnightly cycle. However, I do not go along with the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) in wanting to extend that right further. It is reasonable to expect owner-occupiers to be able to cope with monthly arrangements. I do not know what the figures are in Nottingham, but nationally only 9 per cent. of people rent in the private sector. Often people are dealing with arms-length private sector landlords. It would be dangerous—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman cover the point that with a large increase in the number of people facing redundancy—who are not paying out their monthly mortgage but may have a fortnightly income benefit—it could be helpful to be allowed to pay, like tenants, on a fortnightly basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, and my sentiments are with him, but we are dealing with primary legislation. I do not know whether the Minister will confer powers on local authorities to make special arrangements to deal with such problems. If that is possible, the Minister will respond, I am sure. As I said, I am not sure that I would want this to be enshrined in primary legislation because it is open to abuse.<br><br>
My worry about the amendment centres on private sector landlords. I do not wish to cast aspersions on the generality of private landlords, but we are all aware that some are less than helpful to their tenants. I do not want to see tenants made innocent victims when the rent has been paid but the landlord has not paid the local tax. In those circumstances, the council might have to take action against innocent tenants.<br><br>
I do not want changes in the owner-occupied sector, nor for tenants in the private sector. But I would like the Minister to deal with one of the problems that we faced under the poll tax, so that local authorities and housing associations can deal with the problem that has been raised —in the way that rates used to be collected under the old arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment appears, at first, to be very reasonable. However, it would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
allow people to pay the council tax to their local authority, which would cause enormous administrative problems. We cannot therefore accept the amendment.<br><br>
However, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) will be interested to learn that paragraph 2(2)(b) of schedule 2 will provide power to make regulations with which an authority could set up an instalment scheme in accordance with prescribed rules. For example, the hon. Gentleman discussed the way in which council tenants pay rent. Most tenants pay rent weekly, fortnightly or monthly. There will be nothing to prevent a local authority from including in a tenant's rent bill a provision to pay the council tax at the same time. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are at one to maximise income and to avoid the accumulation of debts. Our exchange has been helpful. How can those of us who want to pay the council tax weekly or fortnightly encourage more local authorities to offer such an option? I mentioned Kirklees and Winchester as examples of good practice, but many authorities do not offer such a choice. How can one encourage those authorities to do so, and improve collection rates?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be for local authorities to decide what is the best way to collect council tax moneys. As long as a local authority fulfils its duty to collect moneys, and shows, perhaps to the district auditor, that it does so in an efficient manner, it is not for the Government to advance a preferred method.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the old rating, system, local authorities collected both rates and rent with one book. Is that feasible with the council tax, especially in Scotland, where the collecting authority is not the same as the housing authority? Housing is controlled by the district council, but collection is done by the region, except on the islands. The district council would have to take on the role of agent for regional councils.<br><br>
Under the poll tax, with the exception of the SNP-controlled Angus district council, most district councils refused to do this. The SNP was happy to collect the poll tax in the one district council that it controlled, even though it opposed payment of the poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it is possible in Scotland to do as the hon. Gentleman described, and to have the collection made in one go on behalf of a separate authority—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shown separately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My next point was made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo). While it may be sensible for an authority to collect rent and council tax together from its tenants, those moneys must be shown separately and held, by the local authority, in separate accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to hear that that will be left to local authorities. I was interested to hear that in Scotland the housing authority does not collect taxes. The authorities in cities with many council properties, which have had problems collecting the poll tax separately from their tenants' rent, will welcome the measure. We should not force the issue, as long as it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0305">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
made clear to local authorities that that option is available. Cities such as Nottingham will grasp that opportunity with both hands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. If the hon. Member for Eastbourne is happy with the assurance that I have given him, he should withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed, because we began with considerable agreement about achieving a maximum collection rate and making it easier for people to pay. Many local authorities are rigid and stick to their system of monthly collections as the minimum payment that they will accept. Poll tax collection has caused enormous problems which I think will continue with council tax collection. If the individual or family in a property has to pay the tax, the easiest way is to pay it out of their income, and if they are paid weekly the easiest way is to pay it out of their weekly pay packet. To put aside a contribution for four consecutive weeks to cover the monthly payment—of course, it is not quite enough— presents a problem for people on low incomes and for those who do not enjoy the level of income that we do. There is a lack of consideration for people who do not have the funds to meet these taxes.<br><br>
I and other hon. Members have enormous sympathy with local authorities which will be left to struggle with the administration of the council tax, but it is important to ensure that people can pay the tax and are encouraged to pay it. The best way to do that is to match the payment with their income profile. Nothing I have heard from the Minister shows that the Government have thought that through. The Bill makes no greater concession on this matter than the poll tax legislation, so I shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thought that I had explained to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) that his amendment would require the local authority to provide whatever system a council taxpayer wanted, and would not allow the local authority the discretion to decide which system it uses to collect the tax. The rules for the rates, the community charge and now for the council tax allow a 10-monthly instalment system that I would recommend to most people. By far the most efficient way for people with bank accounts to pay is by direct debit. We leave it to the good sense of local authorities.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that because people on the lowest incomes usually live in public sector housing, it will be possible for the local authority to collect the council tax on the same basis as the council rents. To answer my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South, the council tax will be shown separately on the bill. I am grateful to him for making that point.<br><br>
I do not think that there is much dispute between us. The hon. Member for Eastbourne wants to make it mandatory for local authorities to provide whatever system of payment the liable person wants, such as weekly or fortnightly collections. We should leave this matter to the good sense of the local authorities. We give them the power and the discretion. I am surprised that the Liberal party, which is always accusing us of centralisation, now wants us to give orders to local authorities rather than leave it to local democracy to decide the best way forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make it clear that Liberal Democrats are on the side of the people. If someone goes into his town
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
hall and says that he is paid weekly or fortnightly so would like to pay the council tax weekly or fortnightly, we believe that the answer should be "Yes, you can do that." At present that is not the answer given by town halls. We believe that the individual has the right to pay his payments at the same time as he receives his income. It is a simple principle. The problem of leaving it to local authorities or, indeed, to any body, organisation or group, is that the individual is told that he cannot pay in that way.<br><br>
The Minister has not moved forward, even though his words have sounded very worthy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Scotland, housing bodies include district councils and other public housing authorities. If a district council refuses to undertake the collection procedure for whatever purpose, the Secretary of State has the power to force it to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's point is extremely helpful and encouraging. If the Minister would adopt that policy for England it would be extremely helpful. But that is not on offer today. What is on offer is our amendment which seeks to provide that
<br><blockquote><p>"where a liable person so requests, payments on account shall be accepted at weekly or fortnightly intervals".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No; I have just sat down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Coward!<br><br>
I wanted to ask a question of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti), but he quickly tucked himself into his seat to avoid it. However, he cannot avoid it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I was, on the contrary, rather generous. I had already concluded my remarks when the Minister started the debate again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman will not be here long enough to gain experience of how things work.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman's motive is to maximise the return, it is a financial motive. Has he taken account of the fact that if only a tiny handful of people want to pay in his way, the cost of providing the service would be quite high? It would fit better with what we suppose to be the policy of the Liberal party—although we recognise that that changes from one constituency to another—to allow local authorities to make their own choice. He is asking the Government to dictate on that. Has he calculated how much the idea would cost local authorities?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Earlier in the sitting, the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) raised a question

regarding an amendment tabled in her name and that of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) and amendments tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and some of his hon. Friends. The hon. Lady wanted to know if the amendments could be taken as a group together. I suggested that the matter should be discussed, and it is now agreed.</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 158 will be taken with amendments Nos. 216 and 217 in schedule 4. Amendments Nos. 216 and 217 will thus be deleted from schedule 8.</p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 196, in page 85, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) No regulations under sub-paragraph (2) above shall be made unless a draft of the statutory instrument has been laid before and approved by resolution of the House of Commons.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 203, in clause 111, page 76, line 28, after 'below', insert— '(bb) paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 to this Act.'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are continuing the debate on the nature of discounts and registration and the problems that local authorities will face in implementing the Bill.<br><br>
The best way to illustrate my point is to refer to an issue raised on the Floor of the House this afternoon. Local authorities have to implement a certain law. The Attorney-General, in his wisdom, feels unable to intervene, either for or against, in the implementation of the law by local authorities or the breaking of it by organisations such as B and Q.<br><br>
Similar points are being made in respect of how this Bill should be implemented. Local authorities are provided with the duty to do something but not with the resources or the legal power to carry it out. If they take action which proves controversial, they are blamed for having got it wrong. They are given a legal duty to carry out a piece of legislation, in this case, to act as a billing authority in a way that ensures that the law is adhered to, rights are secured and discounts given to those who are entitled to them. However, the Government do not specify how the local authority is expected to do that, and the courts and the data protection registrar have to judge whether it is carrying out its duties correctly. That is not decentralising power; it is an attempt to devolve blame.<br><br>
Local authorities are capped if they spend money enforcing the law of the land; they are subject to fiduciary duty if they take a risk that results in the taxpayer losing money because they may have to provide indemnity if B and Q, Asda or Tesco win their cases in the European courts. Local authorities must pick up the bill for legal proceedings and the lost trading account for companies that they forbade to trade on Sunday.<br><br>
I suspect that the Bill is part of the same ball game. The Government use words such as "may" rather than "will" or "must" in the Bill when there is no specification of powers. Ministers have shed little light on the matter so far. The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment said in our sitting on 19 November that local authorities were entitled to use the poll tax register, but poll tax registers are already in disarray. Local authorities have difficulty maintaining the credibility of their poll tax
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
registers while trying to chase people and discover who is where. Everyone knows that the poll tax is on its way out; thus the difficulty in trying to maintain the registers is even greater.<br><br>
The poll tax is in decay. The ability of a local authority to carry out its duties as the billing authority is unclear to the professionals whose task it is. Yet the Government deny that there must be a register to enable their will to be carried out. Instead of a register, it may be that we shall have a list, a la the Secretary of State for Scotland's belief that there is a difference between the two. That is not a religious phrase, Mr. Leadbitter. My use of French is an attempt to be a true European in such matters, just in case the <i>Daily Mail</i> persuades the Prime Minister that there should be one European language and, as is always the danger, it turns out not to be English. However, I recall that at the beginning of our deliberations we agreed that we should call the register a record, describr j 2-2ing who lives where, who is the head of the household and what the relationships between the members of that household are. As we discussed yesterday—at least, I think it was yesterday, but it could have been today, given the way time merges here—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —even when one is not.<br><br>
No proper register is being proposed to deal with the liability governing people's first and second homes. The matter is very confused. The Government want people to have the right to a discount. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand it the Government, although they want that discount to be calculable for the bill that is sent out, are unwilling to provide either the clarity or the power to make that possible.<br><br>
We know, from the difficulties encountered by the data registration officer in obtaining information from people when the poll tax was being implemented, that this is a minefield. In Plymouth, which was not under Labour control at the time, people were asked who slept in which bedrooms. As we found out the other night, the real question should have been, "Who were they eating at table with?" One can sleep with a person and not be adjudged to be cohabiting, but it is a different matter entirely if one shares a table and cutlery with a person on a regular basis. —<i>[Interruption.]</i> I give way to my hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just going to make a remark about people's eating habits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I heard my hon.

However, I shall not go into that again this afternoon, as one's performance between the witching hour and two o'clock in the morning is not to be repeated between 5 pm and 6 pm.<br><br>
Amendment No. 196 is a probing amendment. What do the Government expect local authorities to do? It will not be good enough for them to do their best. The words "might" or "may" are not used—although local authorities will have to exert all their might and main in attempting to carry out the law. The amendment is designed to discover what Ministers would do if they were elected council members in charge of the billing process.

What would they say to their officers about carrying out a law for which a discount system, as has been shown conclusively in the past few days, would be inoperable?<br><br>
I should also be interested to hear how the two Liberal Democrat Members in the Committee would implement the discount scheme, as they have consistently voted for it. Those who believe in that scheme must be able to tell us how it should be implemented and how a councillor or an officer of a council should deal with it. If they cannot, they will be engaged in another hand-washing job, saying, "We have invented a scheme that we know is unworkable. The law will be proved an ass when people try to enforce it, but we want someone else to dream up a way to stagger through and carry out the process."<br><br>
We want to know what exactly the Government expect local authorities to do. They might study paragraph 2(1)(a) and line 25 which exemplifies the catch-22 in the regulations to follow. A duty is laid on the billing authority to inform a liable person of any assumptions that the authority has made in awarding or refusing a discount. That authority also has the problem of ascertaining whether somebody has fraudulently sought a discount.<br><br>
The poll tax legislation provided for a £50 fine for wrongful information, but there is no such proposal in the Bill and no enforcement power or penalty for those who do not discharge their personal duty to seek their rights legally.<br><br>
We want to obtain real answers to fundamental questions about how the scheme will work and how the Government expect others to enforce it. If they are unable to implement the Government's proposals, the Government must not be allowed to say in the future, that the power lies with local authorities, who will be blamed for the mess that the Government have created.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) made an important reference to the relationship between local authorities and the Government. The local authorities must try to work out what the Government intend for them. My hon. Friend rightly referred to what was said this afternoon in the Chamber about the problems of Sunday trading. My local authority, Forfaen borough council, took B and Q to court but could go no further because it had no backing from the Government. That was the essence of what was discussed earlier today.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brightside and you, Mr. Leadbitter, will recall many evenings when we discussed the problem of the poll tax register during the debate on the poll tax Bill. We said then, and we repeat now, that the Government should have listened to what local authorities had to say about civil liberties and the register, and about the practical steps needed to implement it and pay for it. The reason why the poll tax has gone is not merely because it lost its credibility but because of the cost of its administration. In Wales alone, the cost has been more than £100 million. Further, people lost confidence in the way in which the poll tax operated.<br><br>
All the associations which represent the local authorities which will be responsible for implementing the new council tax, regardless of whether they are controlled by the Labour party or the Conservative party, have said that they will not be able to implement it, with its discounts and so on, unless there is a form of register. For example, the Association of Dictrict Councils stated on 8 November:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"To the extent that the Council Tax has a combination of property and personal elements it will be necessary to hold considerable amounts of information on both properties and individuals in order to deliver appropriate bills and provide the right discounts and benefits. Since there is no provision for a register local authorities will be faced with a difficult task."</p></blockquote>
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities said much the same, and recently the Council of Welsh Districts stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst it may take a different form to the present community charge register, the system of exemptions referred to later in the Consultation Paper will necessitate the maintenance of substantial records which will need to be regularly updated and will require adequate means of verification. It is not sufficient to state that local authorities would take their own steps to verify the information provided. Collecting authorities must be given full statutory powers to verify information to ensure that the tax is fairly operated and not widely abused."</p></blockquote>
All practitioners in local government, the officers and members of the authorities who must put this council tax into operation, are telling the Government that it cannot work unless there is some form of register. If the Government refuse to acknowledge that advice, the chaos we have seen with the poll tax will be created again.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I emphasise the same point from the Scottish point of view? The register for the poll tax created chaos in Scotland but the local authorities tell us that this tax will be equally chaotic unless they have powers to obtain information which the Bill simply does not give them. Paragraph 9 of the schedule relates to the supply of information to authorities but there is no mention of the individual taxpayer. Local authorities believe that there will be a discount system, not a straight property tax system in which each house is taxed, making it easy to keep a valuation roll. A much more thorough means of obtaining information is needed.<br><br>
Finally, it does not seem possible even to keep track of the ownership of properties under the Bill. I am informed that, although not in England, in Scotland under the poll tax legislation when a property changes hands a solicitor has a statutory obligation to inform the relevant body that ownership of that property is being transferred. There is nothing about that in this Bill. If a person buys a house, who will tell the local authority about it? Those involved in the sale should, but there is no obligation on them to do so. How will we keep track of the changes in ownership of properties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am now standing up, in case anyone thinks I am not. I have to make that joke every time to protect the Chairman, the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) and myself from sizeist remarks. I should like the Minister to clarify a few points but I shall not be speaking about them until the break at 7 o'clock. I note that the Minister of State is mightily relieved about that.<br><br>
Paragraph 4(4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations may include provision that the authority must inform the person who is or will be liable to pay the chargeable amount of that assumption."</p></blockquote>
When will the regulations be available? Does the use of the word "may" mean that the Government are not quite sure what the regulations will include and when they will be made available either for consultation or implementation. That is vital, particularly for local authorities who are waiting with interest to find out what requirements will be laid down.<br><br>
Paragraph 4(2) states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0308">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations under this Schedule may include provision that, before making any calculation of the chargeable amount for the purposes of regulations under this Schedule, the authority shall take reasonable steps to ascertain whether that amount is subject to any discount, and if so, the amount of that discount."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister define "reasonable"? What "reasonable steps" can local authorities take? Will it be left to local authorities to test the water and, later, left to the courts of the Data Protection Registrar to challenge, if necessary?<br><br>
I do not want local authorities to have to go to court to confirm that their actions are reasonable, in accordance with the schedule. The Law Officers of the House should not leave local authorities to sort out such matters themselves, requiring council tax payers to meet the bills if the authorities lose in court. If the Government want to implement the sub-paragraph, they must set out clearly what they mean by "reasonable steps". That would prevent the Data Protection Registrar from having to use his right to protect individuals from intrusion and challenging the reasonable steps taken by local authorities that happened under the poll tax arrangements and those steps were found to be entirely unreasonable. I hope that the Under-Secretary will give reasonable replies to those reasonable points.<br><br>
I want to refer to column 76 of the proceedings of our sitting on 19 November. Does the Under-Secretary of State have a copy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then I shall read out the relevant passage. My hon. Friends and the Members for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) and for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) asked the Under-Secretary about the register and billing arrangements for authorities. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State has given the hon. Gentleman a copy of <i>Hansard.</i> The Under-Secretary said that complaints about problems with the community charge register were justified, but he thought it possible
<br><blockquote><p>"for a local authority to use that register to discover who lives where."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 19 November 1991; c.76]</p></blockquote>
Given that acknowledgement, why does the Under-Secretary of State continue to insist that it is not necessary to reintroduce the register as the council tax register? If local authorities do reintroduce it, when will the Government issue clear guidelines about the use of such information? Even though the Bill does not require local authorities to have a council tax register, many authorities will have to use one to ensure efficient implementation of the legislation. What guidelines will the Government give on the operation and management of those registers? Alternatively, will they, once again, simply leave the matter until local authorities, when challenged in court, are found to be acting outside the law? At that point, the way in which authorities maintain information about implementing legislation will have collapsed.<br><br>
Let us leave aside party political differences. After the tax is up and running and the registers are working well, we do not want local authorities to be unable, because of a legal challenge that is upheld, to operate effectively or to collect the information needed for good management of the council tax discount system for individuals whose low income or other circumstances entitle them to reductions.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
If that happens, local authorities will be completely unable to operate the system effectively because they will have been found to be outside the law in terms of maintaining information and records about those who pay tax.<br><br>
Those practical considerations are better resolved now rather than after the Bill is enacted and the system is up and running. It is better to do something now than wait until a local authority is challenged by individuals who feel that it is acting unreasonably, despite the authority's belief that its actions are reasonable according to the legislation's woolly wording. Local authorities are being asked to take a chance and, if they lose, the Government will not come to their rescue—the authorities will be left to get on with it, however difficult that may be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have an awful feeling that, whatever arguments I produced, Opposition Members would not agree with me. I shall, however, attempt to be very precise in answering the questions.<br><br>
Local authorities which have been discussing regulations with us will not have to wait very long—nor will the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)—before seeing the draft regulations. The "key" regulations, if I may call them that, will be available to local authority associations in draft before Christmas. That is the firm intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Leader of the House told us in the debate on the guillotine motion, which the Minister was unfortunately unable to attend, that the regulations had already been prepared. I have written asking for them and, as I have had no reply, I assume that someone has whispered that they are not quite ready yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer, to use the hon. Gentleman's inimitable phrase, is that the regulations are proceeding apace. They have been in preparation for some time following discussions with local authority associations, and the hon. Gentleman will have to wait only a short time before the draft regulations are available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is coming up to Christmas, and the Report stage is likely to take place in the last week before the recess. Will the hon. Gentleman promise that the draft regulations will be in the hands of members of the Committee between the end of the Committee stage and Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is rather pushing his luck, but I shall use my best endeavours to ensure that we see something helpful if not by Christmas, then perhaps by hogmanay, a date to which the hon. Gentleman and his constituents attach rather more significance than I do. That would give us a few days more to try to do what he wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Co-operation between the Government and local authorities is extremely important. If any tax is to work, it is essential to build on good relationships. The hon. Gentleman said that there had been discussions with local authorities. Will he be more specific and say when the discussions with the Association of District Councils took place?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am afraid that I cannot recall that date off the top of my head. But, having refreshed my memory, I can inform the Committee that on 12 November my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0309">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"We intend to consult on the most important"</p></blockquote>
regulations
<br><blockquote><p>"before Christmas and to have the regulations ready shortly after Royal Assent."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 November 1991; Vol. 198, c. 1011.]</p></blockquote>
The regulations will then be in their final form.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brightside produced an argument that was a long way from the actual text of the amendment, although it was, of course, in order. He asked me what I would do. I would take the reasonable steps that the hon. Member for Makerfield wanted me to take. I would canvass people and I would record the applicants for single person discount. I would use what records I had and indeed, in paragraph 9 of schedule 2 we propose that local authorities will be allowed to use information from the register.<br><br>
I would also look through the other end of the telescope, which is something that Opposition Members find difficult. Local authorities will not have to rely only on their own efforts to make sure that the correct discounts will be awarded and that the system will operate smoothly because there will be obligations on the payers of the council tax.<br><br>
It is simply not true that discounts cannot be operated without a register. Most households will receive a standard bill. There is no need for the authority to have details of resident numbers and status for them. When discounts and rebates are applicable, the authority will need more details, as it would under any rebate system, as the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) made clear this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary makes an interesting point, but does he concede that more inaccurate bills will initially be sent out than under any previous system, including the poll tax, and that subsequent bills will have to be corrected to show the discounts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no reason to suppose so. I could make an opposite assertion with equal vehemence. We can only wait and see, after taking all reasonable steps and holding discussions with local authorities, whether the system will work.<br><br>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Makerfield seriously. He said that this was not just a question of party politics but of good administration and government. That is why the Government have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the regulations will work.<br><br>
People who are entitled to a discount will be required to inform the local authority when they are no longer so entitled. As ever, fraudulent declarations would contain pecuniary advantage by deception, which is a criminal offence under the Theft Act 1968. That is straightforward. There will be an obligation on the payers of the tax as well as on local authorities to ensure that it will operate expeditiously.<br><br>
I was asked how local authorities will know when a property changes hands. There will be an incentive for tax payers to let the local authority know when properties change hands so that they will no longer be held liable for the tax. The procedures will operate in much the same way as under the rates, and informing the authority will be part of the routine paperwork involved in property transaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Under-Secretary will agree that there will be no incentive for people to inform the billing authority if someone moves in with them. Moving in with another person will now be an act of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
financial sacrifice for the host. For example, if a single man's girlfriend moved in, both would be disqualified from the 25 per cent. discount that they would have got if they were living singly. That is a worry, and the Government should ensure that the local authority has power to deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The obligation is on council taxpayers to behave responsibly, as the vast majority do. It is wrong of the hon. Gentleman to suppose that the vast majority of people try to defraud their local authority, so it is not necessary to go further than I have already stated.<br><br>
The amendment provides that any regulations made under paragraph 4(2) should be subject to an affirmative resolution of the House. The affirmative resolution procedure is usually used only for the more important constitutional and financial matters. It is appropriate that an order under clause 11, for example, to change the appropriate percentage for discount purposes, should be the subject of an affirmative resolution. In our view it is not necessary for regulations requiring authorities to take steps to establish discount eligibility to be subject to affirmative resolution. The negative resolution procedure is right for such regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason why I presented my argument as I did is that if we do not debate the matter this afternoon, and if we do not get the answers that we need about how the provision will work, there is no obligation on the House to discuss the matter again. Unless the affirmative resolution procedure is used, regulations will be laid but, as we know from the way in which poll tax regulations were dealt with, they will never appear for debate on the Floor of the House. That is why we are so worried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does a disservice to the House if he thinks that making regulations the subject of a prayer is so ineffective. I seem to have spent a considerable amount of time late at night listening to Opposition spokesmen debating these issues, and that is a perfectly reasonable way forward.<br><br>
Amendment No. 203 is consequential. It adds to the list in clause 111 a reference appropriate to the affirmative resolution procedure. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of the guillotine, I shall not detain the Committee for much longer. We all know that when we pray against a regulation, the Government pray for an intervention such as a recess, or pray that they can persuade Conservative Members that they want to debate another regulation late into the night. The record on the poll tax regulations shows how many times we prayed against key issues that were not debated at all in the House. When I first came to this place, it took me a year —even after speaking to many venerable friends and colleagues who have been here for several years—to discover that when the Opposition prayed against a regulation, it did not have to be debated unless it was an affirmative order.<br><br>
Many hon. Members are still under the misapprehension that if they lay a prayer, the matter will come up for debate. Often that is not so. Some of us have learnt that and will remember it when we are in Government. When Conservative Members, who will then be the Opposition, whinge about the fact that they have not been able to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0310">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
debate a regulation even though they have prayed against it, we shall say, "We told you so. That is how you behaved and we are following the precedent set by you."</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 85, line 24, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) where the chargeable amount is subject to a discount, the authority shall not require information from the liable person if other persons who fall to be disregarded under Schedule 1 become resident in the dwelling.'.</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) was right to forecast that under the Government's discount proposals in schedule 2 many inaccurate bills will be issued. The problem is vast. There are 7 million single-person households. The Government cannot pretend that there will be a real effort to identify each of those households before the bills are sent out. Inevitably, administrative chaos will result as bills are sent out in standard form, people make applications for discounts as they discover, belatedly and imperfectly, that they are entitled to them, inquiries are made and, late in the financial year, new bills are sent out. That will be horrific for the billing authority and unpleasant for those who must decide what their liability is.<br><br>
We start from this pessimistic scenario. The amendments seek to discover how the Government propose to resolve some of the problems. What obligations will be placed on local authorities to discover the truth, and what corresponding obligations will be placed on individuals to take the initiative in revealing changes in their circumstances? Paragraph 4(5)(b) of schedule 2 requires the liable person to disclose to the local authority changes that make a discount that had hitherto been thought payable no longer appropriate. Will that obligation apply to people who are disregarded for discount purposes and who are, to use the Minister's word, "invisible"? That would be bizarre; but it is not excluded if someone who enjoyed single person discount were to admit to his or her home a person with a status discount and had to report movements of the residence of that person to the local authority.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that no such obligation will be placed on the liable person in these circumstances? To establish that would represent some small diminution of the complexity of the relationship that will arise between the liable person and the billing authority in respect of the discount scheme. As we have discovered at length throughout our proceedings, people's entitlement to discounts will be much affected by other people's movements and changes in other people's status. The liable person will have to make fine judgments, daily, on how such changes will affect liability. Anything that can relieve the burden of making such judgments, and reduce the chance of making mistakes and having to rebill, recalculate and assess how long discount is available for would be welcome. Even if we took that small step forward, it would not affect the general position, which is mind-boggling—nightmarish.<br><br>
I hope that Ministers have contemplated the matter. However, if they had contemplated it, one can hardly believe that they would have proposed such a system. We are trying to lift a corner of whatever obscures the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
situation from Ministers' gaze so that they can glimpse the horror in store for local government from the discount system.<br><br>
The problem is not only one of movements and changes in status. That is not the only complicated aspect that liable people will have to judge. They will have to decide whether friends and family who come to stay will alter their single-person status, and whether their period of stay will be regarded as residence. That is a tricky judgment.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
Let us assume that people are well informed and aware of all the complications. They may even be aware that they have a duty under the regulations to disclose all the day-by-day changes. Let us assume that they know about the changes in movement and status of people and that they have a vague understanding that some concept of residence might be relevant. When those enormously well informed people ask themselves how they are to judge the difficult question of residence, they will discover that there is virtually no guidance from the Government or the Bill.<br><br>
We have already had a long debate on the meaning of residence. The Minister of State made an astonishing assertion that in some circumstances a prisoner in detention could not be regarded as resident in his family home. The hon. Gentleman said that that flowed ineluctably from the case law. I thought that he was chancing his arm slightly; and a tactical withdrawal from that assertion has been made since the debate.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has sent a letter to the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) dealing with the matter. He writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no definition of sole or main residence in the Bill"—</p></blockquote>
we all know that to our cost—
<br><blockquote><p>"and it would be difficult to devise one which would cover all circumstances."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman then looks at the small body of case law and concludes that questions such as the time spent in places are not the only criteria to be considered. I am sure that he is right. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The answer, therefore, to your question about whether a person who spends periods of time away from home will give rise to a discount where there is only one adult left in the home, will depend on the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
That is jolly helpful, I must say. He later says:
<br><blockquote><p>"it will be for local authorities to take decisions on the basis of each individual case."</p></blockquote>
I do not criticise the Under-Secretary at all for the terms in which he has couched the letter. I regret to say that what he says is absolutely accurate. It means that the tricky judgment that has to be made by ordinary people in their everyday lives, juggling the various questions of who is staying and whether there is a change of status, is now complicated by the question of whether a guest staying for a weekend, a week or month is resident. There is no guidance on that question. Ministers may be puzzled about the relevance of this issue, but it is relevant not to discount but to joint and several liabilities. I just wanted to put Ministers out of their misery in case they were wondering why this argument is relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not get miserable listening to the Opposition developing their arguments. We understand that they should be given leeway to develop them, and they often come to the point. However, if, for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
two minutes, we develop an argument that the Opposition do not immediately follow, they become grumpy and try to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just as the Minister denies ever being miserable, let me deny ever being grumpy. My colleagues and I always speak in a spirit of genuine inquiry to learn what the Minister thinks. When we are puzzled about what is in the Minister's mind, we naturally wish for further elucidation. I understand why the Minister is willing to allow us time to develop our questions. That might at least give him time to sort out the answers.<br><br>
Let us consider the example of a couple. Suppose that the wife has Alzheimer's disease and receives respite care at irregular intervals—averaging, say, one week in six. Clearly, her movements do not affect the size of the bill because she would be disregarded. From the Minister's more general comments, I understand that her presence or otherwise would not affect the size of bill paid by her husband. But would her husband have to notify the council each time his wife went in and out of hospital?<br><br>
Let us consider another example. Suppose that the resident's 19-year-old grandson lives in a residential community because of his severe learning difficulties, but stays with his grandmother during the holidays. Would he count as a resident and, if so, for what period? Would the grandmother have to notify the council when she knows the dates of his visits, even though his presence in the home does not affect her council tax bills? I hope that we shall be told that the grandmother would not have to do that. If she had to make such a declaration, however, the bureaucracy and effort involved would surely act as a disincentive for families that try to maintain links with their relatives.<br><br>
We might be told that the answer is simply that no such obligation exists because the bill would not be affected. From the drafting of paragraph 4(5)(b) of schedule 2, I assume that as such movements do not affect the discount, no obligation is intended to be applied.<br><br>
A different matter arises on joint and several liability. Let us again consider the husband whose wife suffers from Alzheimer's disease and assume that when she comes home at irregular intervals she is regarded as in residence. Moreover, let us assume that, although she does not affect the size of the discount or the bill, her husband fails to pay the bill. She may have a large estate that is administered by someone else. Therefore, she will suddenly become jointly and severally liable because she is regarded as being resident. In such circumstances, is there an obligation on the husband—who may not know that he will not pay the bill—to notify the local authority of his wife's movements as she goes backwards and forwards, so that a calculation can be made about when she is resident? If she is regarded as resident, under the provisions in clause 9 she would be jointly and severally liable, even though her presence did not affect the size of the bill.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister understands our argument, which brings us back to the issue that we mentioned briefly this morning. It is an issue that we would describe as one of heartlessness, but possibly heartlessness that is driven by a purported logic that is not really logical. Perhaps Ministers would be heartless in requiring a disclosure in order to say that a sick, elderly woman, who did not know where she was when she managed to get home for one week in six, was resident for that period and so became jointly and severally liable. I could understand the logic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
leading to that heartless conclusion; but I could understand it only for the 50 per cent. of the property tax which would properly be regarded as the household element. I cannot understand why the liability under the joint and several liability provisions should include the personal head tax of another person. This morning, the Minister tried to justify the Government's position on the ground that what was being proposed was a household bill. That is not good enough. The household bill is merely a calculation, which in the case that we are postulating creates joint and several liability. It is based on two separate elements. I am sure that the Minister has heard his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland constantly referring to the two elements—the property and personal elements.<br><br>
When the household bill is calculated, it always includes the 50 per cent. property element, but there is nothing automatic about the personal element and the Government have gone to great lengths to exempt specific categories of people from the personal element on account of their status. Having exempted them, because it would be wrong or unfair to require them to be liable, it cannot be logical for them suddenly to become liable for another person's head tax. The issue is how the household bill is calculated, and the Minister cannot take refuge in the fiction of joint and several liability for household bills. The way in which the bill is calculated is not pure accident; the Government have laid down the rules to provide some exemptions from the household bill but have failed to provide exemptions for people in the category that I have described from other elements.<br><br>
We need to know the Government's intention, and we need answers to two questions. I assume that the Government will not require someone who enjoys a single discount to disclose movements in and out of the household by people who enjoy a status discount—at least not for the purposes of calculating the discount and, therefore, the size of the bill. What will happen under clauses 6 and 9—the provisions are slightly different—if joint and several liability arises and, therefore, the question of residence becomes relevant? Will a liable person who enjoys the single person discount be encouraged not to record movements of a person who enjoys a status discount, but have an obligation to disclose to the local authority periods during which the second person is a member of the household for the purposes of residence and, therefore, of joint and several liability?<br><br>
If the answer is no, the Government are in deep trouble, they could not adhere to their previous position of insisting that joint and several liability should apply if they are not making provision to establish that it exists. I hope that the Minister will answer that question. The purpose of the amendment is to tease out more information on precisely what obligations they propose to impose on liable people to disclose such changes in their household circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first question, the assumption of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is correct. There is no requirement for someone who enjoys a single person discount to inform the local authority of the arrival of another person who does not affect that discount—for example, a student. The local authority would have to be informed only if there was reason to believe that the chargeable amount was not subject to discount or was subject to a smaller discount. The hon. Gentleman said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0312">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
that it would be bizarre if someone was required to inform the local authority of the arrival of a second person who did not affect the discount status, and I agree.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said in his opening remarks that the Government were not pretending that any effort would be made to establish where single-person discounts were applicable and that a large number of inaccurate bills would be sent out. I should like to correct that. We are encouraging local authorities to take reasonable steps to discover in advance who is likely to claim a discount. They may look at the community charge register or they may wish to conduct a canvass. They would state on each bill that they send out to people about whom they have no information—perhaps, people from whom they received no reply to their canvass—that it was a 100 per cent. bill and that, if the recipient lived alone or if the property was not his or her sole or main residence, a discount of 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. would be applicable.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the point of difference between us cannot be resolved. I shall continue to assert that the problem is much greater than the Minister accepts and the Minister will continue to assure me that reasonable steps will be taken by local authorities with encouragement from the Government.<br><br>
Has the Minister carried out any estimate of the proportion of bills that will need to be sent out a second time? Has any thought been given to the size of the problem, if so what were the results?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that figure is calculable. However, if I were to receive a piece of paper through my letterbox which informed me that, if I did not respond, I was likely to be sent a bill a third bigger than it should be, I would respond. I would want to let the authority know straight away that I thought that I was entitled to a discount. Even with the best will in the world, once a person has received a bill from a local authority, it is sometimes difficult to shake it off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have excited the hon. Member for Leyton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Does that mean that a local authority will have to send out the wrong bill every year —that is, the bill for the full amount—and that each person who thinks that he or she is entitled to a discount will then claim one? Alternatively, if a local authority takes the discount into account when calculating the following year's bill but the person's circumstances have changed, he or she is unlikely to notify the local authority that the bill is too low.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, it will not be necessary for the wrong bill to be sent out, because the local authority might know in advance of sending out the bill that a single-person discount is applicable, either by referring to the community charge register or as the result of conducting a canvass. So, I question the hon. Gentleman's first premise.<br><br>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, if I had obtained a single-person discount, which then ceased to be applicable, I would be bound by paragraph 4(5)(b) to inform the local authority. I would be obliged by law to do that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has used the term "canvass" several times. Does that mean a written communication inviting a reply or someone calling at the door? In either case, how often will a canvass be conducted? The information gained from a canvass at a given time of year might not be relevant by the time that the bill is sent out. Many bills will be issued, and the Minister's comments do not allay our fears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A canvass could cover either eventuality. Local authorities may wish to conduct a canvass in different ways, but they will need to approach people to obtain the information. I expect that they will make clear at the time that the information will be used as a basis for the original bill. If, during the spring, a local authority discovered that a person lived alone and was entitled to single person discount, I expect that the bill sent out in April would state clearly, "this bill was based on the assumption that you are the only person eligible to pay the council tax and you have therefore been given a 25 per cent. discount. You must understand that if your circumstances have changed or change in future you are obliged by law to inform the local authority so that your bill may be adjusted." The bill would further state that penalties would be imposed for fraudulent declarations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may not have been a declaration. The information may have been taken by the council tax registrar from the electoral register or elsewhere. In such a case the individual could argue, "I never made any such claim, so how can it be fraudulent?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My argument was based on the premise that a canvass had taken place, in which case people would have made declarations. If the information had been obtained by other means, the statement on the bill might be rephrased to say, "We have reason to believe that you are entitled to a single person's discount, but we expect you to confirm that when you send the money for the bill." That might be achieved by ticking a box or signing a declaration. That would be a sensible way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that every household will receive at least two communications? The first would include a warning stating that if the information returned did not state otherwise the recipient would be liable for the full amount. Only then would the bill be issued—and that would depend on the information returned being usable and containing no further comments. That destroys the Minister's argument that every household will receive only one communication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never said that there will be only one communication for every household; I said that there will be one household bill, which is a different matter. We have been discussing two different examples. When a canvass is followed by the issuing of a bill, the canvass and bill will each constitute a contact with the council tax payer, which adds up to two communications. In the case put forward by the hon. Member for Leyton, the information would be obtained from another source, in which case the bill would be issued and the recipient asked whether an accurate assumption had been made. In that case there would be only one communication with the council tax payer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We go back a long way.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0313">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a household with more than one council tax payer it is possible that one liable person may provide information about another individual in the household. In such a case will the local authority be required to check with the person mentioned on the initial declaration that the information provided is correct before the bills are adjusted? Or will one declaration be required for each liable person in the household?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to insult the hon. Lady by implying that she has been associated with me for a time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had missed something in my past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the fact that I was the Minister on duty in the Chamber when the hon. Lady made her formidable maiden speech, we have also served together on Social Security Bill Committees. She may recall that, under the rating system, it was possible for one person only in the household to make a declaration about the incomes of others in the household when the issue of non-dependent deductions arose. I envisage that a similar system will operate under the council tax. Detailed regulations are not yet available, but I hope that they will be soon.<br><br>
I wish to respond to the second question of the hon. Member for Dagenham. Whenever we legislate, we subject ourselves to the interpretation of such laws in practice in different circumstances and, eventually, in courts of law. We may make a law that states that no person shall ride a bicycle in the park, but it is then for others to define a person, a bicycle, a park and what constitutes riding. All those issues must be interpreted under specific circumstances!<br><br>
We are in a similar position now. We are saying that, in most cases, liability for the council tax is based on habitual residence. We would not get much further if we began to define, in a series of complicated regulations, what we thought was the meaning of "habitual residence". For example, if we define a period during which a person might go into respite care as constituting the point at which a change occurred between his residence in one place and another, we would immediately be confronted with circumstances that were not what we had envisaged when we draft the regulations. Extraordinarily complicated circumstances would arise that did not fit well with what we had defined, and we would hand over to the court— perhaps one stage further down the line—the business of fitting them to the regulations that we had made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to develop the argument, but I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's argument, but he is being disingenuous. He is right; whatever efforts were made in legislation to define a concept such as residence, the courts would then interpret that definition. That is what happens under our constitution, and that is what should happen. However, the Minister, by suggesting that that is always the case, overlooks the fact that, when an issue matters a great deal to specific legislation, it would be normal practice for that legislation to attempt to define such issues. Under this Bill, the concept of residence underpins people's liability for the council tax.<br><br>
The Bill, in fact, attempts to make various definitions, such as the meaning of a dwelling. That is standard
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
practice. When a Bill does not define certain factors, Ministers can argue that a well-developed body of case law exists, as a result of which most people know what a certain concept means. However, the Minister and his ministerial colleagues have told the Committee that the Bill does not offer a definition and that there is no well-developed body of case law for the purpose of defining a person's liability. Although I understand the hon. Gentleman's basic premise, he is being disingenuous by saying that that state of affairs is normal. It is comparatively unusual to define liability on the basis of such an important concept on which people are given no guidance as to its meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply in two parts. First, the case law is slightly more developed that the hon. Gentleman has claimed. The letter from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment is directed at that. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman seems to be ruling out novelty in legislation. Obviously, case law develops from new legislation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham has exaggerated the problem. He asked whether a person who arrives for a weekend, a week or a month will be considered as habitually resident. On reflection, he will appreciate that that is a far-fetched example. It seems most unlikely—I cannot be categoric, as I am not a court of law—that a person with a residence elsewhere who arrives at someone's house for a weekend, a week or a month will be deemed to be habitually resident there.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman talked about a wife with Alzheimer's disease who goes into respite care. I believe that the term respite care implies that a change of residence has not occurred; such care is meant as a break for the sufferer and the carer. Another example cited by the hon. Gentleman related to a 19-year-old boy who "lives in a community". That phrase implies that the boy had a good idea about his habitual home. That he lives in such a residence but returns to his parents home changes nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin to feel a sense of déjà vu.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman feels queasy, he should spend some time outside the Committee Room. I am sure that we should all forgive him, were he to do so.<br><br>
I thought that I had heard all the points about joint and several liability made by the hon. Member for Dagenham this morning. I also thought that I had given him all the replies that I could. I continue to think that one person or more than one person should be liable for a household bill, whatever discounts it includes. If one person only were liable—if one person only were at the top of the hierarchy under clause 6—the question would not arise. It is only when two or more people are at the top of the hierarchy that a household bill—whatever personal or property elements are included—will be deemed to be the liability of those people jointly and severally. The hon. Gentleman and I will not see eye to eye on that, but we have now argued about all the issues that relate to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister's latter remark is right. Will he not accept that what he said about the problem arising only when joint and several liability applies, because two people are in the same category under clause 6, is not God-given? That is not a law of nature, but the result of the legislation, so it could be changed. Why does the Minister not change it?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0314">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I believe that that is logical and because we want to return to household bills—albeit made up of property and personal elements, as my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood said. None the less the bill generated is a household bill and one or more people will be liable under clause 6. There is an absolute logic, justice and fairness in that. That is what we intended, which is why we drafted the Bill in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee much longer because, as the Minister implied, we have reached an impasse. However, what he said about the wider issue, which certainly interested my hon. Friends, was horrifying. He painted a picture of horrendous complexity. It is widely accepted that we are dealing with 7 million households, plus those households that might be affected by various status discounts, and that changes will be made day by day.<br><br>
It is interesting to speculate how many pieces of paper could be generated by the system. First, there is the canvass, then the reply and next comes the bill. It is possible that there might be changes, bearing in mind that many people move in the course of a year, which means another communication, a new bill, and another payment. Even relatively simple cases will generate a huge number of transactions and bits of paper.<br><br>
One Conservative Member accused me of inflating the percentage of people who move during the course of a year; he said that I started with 40 per cent. and somehow increased it to 60 per cent. Whoever made that point simply misunderstood the source of the information. I cannot remember, but the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) may have made that ill-informed remark, as he clearly finds it difficult to follow the Committee's proceedings. However, let me assure the hon. Gentleman that the figures came directly from the Audit Commission report. The average movement accounted for 40 per cent. of people—much higher than was ever envisaged—but in some parts of the country, particularly in the cities, it was as high as 50 per cent. and in inner London it reached 60 per cent. Those are alarming figures, not because they reveal an alarming state of affairs but because the Government propose a huge exercise in repeated communications.<br><br>
I remind the Minister of an example that I gave—it may have been yesterday, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) says, things have become a bit of a blur. A citizens advice bureau cited a not untypical case of a young woman who had three changes of address during a year, moving from one local authority area to another and three changes of status discount.<br><br>
The number of bits of paper will be mind-boggling, yet the Minister tells us that so remote is he from that reality, so unconcerned is he, that he has not bothered to estimate the number of communications, the likely number of rebillings or the cost of the exercise. It is all dismissed with that airy gesture that was so often used about problems with the poll tax. It is most alarming that the Minister and the Government are apparently quite unconcerned by the tremendous nightmare that they are cooking up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that we had made no estimate of the costs of setting up the system. The hon. Gentleman did not ask me about that. The consultants who investigated what the setting-up costs will be have taken into account the type of communications with council tax
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
payers that they believe will be necessary. Within that number, which we have declared publicly and which we have supported with £86 million of expenditure, is a calculation of how much to-ing and fro-ing will be needed at the setting-up stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister says about the setting-up costs. He is quite right to say that I did not ask him about that. I asked him about the continuing, day-by-day, month-by-month, year-by-year costs of trying to administer that horrifically complicated structure. I am not saying that the Minister has the setting-up costs right, but we are alarmed that he has made no estimate of the further additional, continuing costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend ask the Minister for an estimate of the initial setting up costs? The Minister does not give much away, but he offered to provide that information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might take the opportunity to repeat that information, but I acknowledge that he has already provided it.<br><br>
I wish to know what the continuing costs are. I am alarmed that no estimate has been made. The Minister is waving a piece of paper—perhaps an estimate has been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I did not want to disappoint the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) or my officials. The estimated initial setting up costs are £115 million in revenue costs and £41 million in capital costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the provision for covering those costs was £86 million.<br><br>
Although I have registered the Opposition's disquiet, I am happy with the Minister's confirmation that, for discount purposes, a liable person would bear no obligation for the movements of a disregarded person in and out of the household. The Bill does not make that clear. However, I assume from what the Minister has said that the regulations will clarify that point.<br><br>
I was worried by the Minister's dismissal of a serious problem. Would a person who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, and who visited a household periodically, be considered a resident? Would the liable person have to disclose that position for the purpose of joint and several liability? The Minister has not replied properly to that question, because we disagree about whether it is important.<br><br>
I am not happy with the debate, but I shall not divide the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</ol></ul></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 206 and 207.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 205 would allow the Secretary of State to require local authorities to notify the resident whether they had reason to believe that a dwelling was exempt. They may first be required to take reasonable steps to ascertain whether any dwelling will be exempt. The amendment parallels the provision for notification about discounts in paragraph 4.<br><br>
Notification is necessary for two reasons. First, it ensures that residents of exempt dwellings are not left in any doubt that the local authority understands their position. Secondly, once the local authority has notified the resident that it believes the dwelling to be exempt, the amendment would allow regulations to provide that the resident must tell the local authority of any reason to believe that the dwelling is not exempt. That will help local authorities to ensure that they have not wrongly exempted properties.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 206 and 207 would allow authorities to impose penalties on residents who failed to notify them
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
that their properties were not exempt after being told that the authorities believed them to be exempt. The amendments parallel the provisions for discounts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the rating system, some buildings and domestic properties were exempt. I have been asked by someone who owns a croft, and whose wife is a Church of Scotland minister, whether crofts will be exempt from the council tax, as they were from rating, and whether manses or vicarages belonging to the Church of England will also be exempt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The shorter answer is that they will not be exempt. The longer answer is that we are having discussions with the Church on the liability of ministers of religion and on whether any special arrangement should be made. We shall report our progess in due course.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may be slightly unusual. The Minister will have no knowledge of previous crofting legislation on rates. That specific aspect was covered by the old crofting legislation. The value of the house on a croft is low—in most cases it is well below £27,000. Can the Scottish Office Minister say anything about crofts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall continue to reply to the debate on the Government amendments.<br><br>
Whatever the history of crofting legislation, I have already said that crofts will not be exempt from the council tax. We are, however, having discussions with the Church.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 87, leave out line 39.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 46, in page 88, leave out line 13.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to protect the electoral register. During the lunch break I had an eye test. I do not want to make a spectacle of myself, but my optician told me that I was becoming more long-sighted in my left eye. I can see that the effects of the council tax on the electoral register will be deleterious in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should not confuse long sight with far sight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not have to see far to realise the effect of the Bill on the electoral register. If we look back to the poll tax we can see deleterious consequences, so I do not need to look far into the future to realise that the Bill will add to the problems with the electoral register.<br><br>
The Government do not seem to care about that, or about law and order. They spout about people having to obey the law on poll tax, but they are not worried about enforcing the law on Sunday opening, as we have seen today. The Government do not care about the detail of the Bill.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that Opposition Members were conducting a filibuster. What a nerve! He is not a member of the Committee, he is not interested in the details and he does not care whether the Bill will create a mess.<br><br>
Nor do the Government care about democracy. They do not care whether the electoral register is inaccurate,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0316">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 539</span>
which will happen if people do not register. More than 1 million people came off the electoral register of their own accord—perhaps through fear—when the poll tax was introduced. The Government were warned that that would happen, but they were not too bothered about it. I think that the Government consider that they will gain a political advantage and assume that the people who come off the register are likely to be Labour voters at the bottom of the income scale. For crude, party political reasons the Government do not mind that. That smacks of cheating. It is very serious indeed that more than a million people have come off the register, but the Government have no plans to put money into a serious campaign to get them back on the register.<br><br>
As with the poll tax, so with the council tax— deregistration will remain a danger. For example, the pressure will be on a person claiming a discount—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Janman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A millionaire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is tempting me. I have just had a glance at a pamphlet issued by Conservative central office, in which answers are given to all the questions that Conservative party members can expect the public to ask about the council tax. The pamphlet suggests that people will ask about all the yuppies who will claim a discount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no proper answer. The pamphlet relies on the definition of "yuppie" as a person under 30. That is not always true. A yuppie can be relatively old and rich and still get a discount. However, I shall return to that Conservative pamphlet in due course.<br><br>
Yuppie or not, a landlord or a landlady who is keen to get a discount will pressurise other people in the household, such as tenants, to stay off the electoral register. Under the Government proposals, the electoral register will be a source of information, and those landlords and landladies will say, "Dont't register for your vote or I won't get my discount."<br><br>
Of course, in saying that, the house owner would be perpetrating a fraud. Its victims would be the other people in the household, because they would lose their vote. Only yesterday, I quoted the warning from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux that many people who want to register are afraid to do so because they are worried that they will be evicted, and cited some of the examples that that organisation gave. It is a deleterious consequence of the Bill that deregistration will continue and that more people will lose their vote.<br><br>
Access to the electoral register is not necessary for the implementation of the tax. The representation of the people legislation allows personal access to the register. People can look at the register, or use it for electoral purposes. It is sent to Members of Parliament, election candidates and local parties. However, we are discussing the open transfer of that information to council tax officers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be living in a dream world. The electoral registers are available in public libraries for anyone to look at.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly my point. However, the Government are proposing the transfer of information to the council tax collection machinery.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 540</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What for?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the information has changed. That is the fundamental point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the point more fully when I wind up the debate. However, the hon. Gentleman is presumably in receipt, as all Members of Parliament are, of copies of the electoral register. I have no doubt that he uses it for sending out Labour party propaganda unrelated to the right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is my point. Members of Parliament and candidates receive copies of the electoral register, but they use it for its original purpose: to canvass for votes. The Government are saying that electoral registers and all the back-up information that the electoral registration officer obtained—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What back-up information?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal of back-up information. Canvassers go round the streets to collect information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Political canvassers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not political canvassers, although they go round the streets as well. I mean electoral registration officers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That information is not published.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is not published. That is my point. Council tax collection officers, and previously poll tax collection officers, can telephone the electoral registration department on an internal number at the town hall and ask for information on a certain property. They can say that they are checking on the eligibility of the residents for discounts. They can ask if the canvasser of that property obtained any other information that is not on the register.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And put the phone down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am still holding my imaginary phone. I shall put it down. The departments are probably so close that the officers can walk into each other's offices and talk face to face.<br><br>
Information can be passed to the tax collection officer. That takes it out of the realm of the electoral purposes for which the information was collected. It is used for tax collection purposes. That is what people fear and why they do not provide information to the electoral registration officer, or do not register in the first place. Some people are intimidated by their landlords—as in my example—into not registering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it too obvious to say that honest people, probably 99.9 per cent. of the population, have nothing to fear from the public document that is the electoral register? What is the fundamental objection to the register being used for any purpose? Year after year, there are complaints about the register; people come off it for all sorts of reasons. Everybody knows that some people tried to avoid paying the proper dues and taxes that honest people pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the majority of people have nothing to fear. I agree, but many people do have fears. NACAB said that some people are fearful
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 541</span>
of registering because if they do so they might fall out with their landlord and be evicted. The number of such cases, although obviously not the majority, is significant enough for it to be serious. One million people have come off the electoral register, which correlates with the introduction of the poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this another of the hon. Gentleman's great interests in matters Scotch? Perhaps it is another McHarry proposal that gives him an opportunity to speak but to tell us nothing?</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am telling a lot. My hon. Friends tell me that the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman), speaking from a sedentary position in response to my remark that 1 million people had come off the register said, "Hopefully Labour voters." I hope that the hon. Gentleman will rise to confirm that that is what he said. [HON. MEMBERS: "The hon. Gentleman said that himself."]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That would emphasise my earlier point that there was a suspicion that the Conservatives wanted 1 million low-income, vulnerable people off the register because they are more likely to be Labour voters. That smacks of the cheating to which I referred earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I confirm that I heard the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) say that he hoped that the 1 million people who came off the register were Labour voters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is on the record now. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Thurrock has not denied it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I confirm that I, too, heard my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) say it, and I share his sentiments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was about to make the traditional announcement that the Chair did not hear the remark. As you are such an untrusting lot, I have a good excuse—my hearing aid was switched off. As there has been confirmation that the remark was made, and as it is on the record, I can do nothing about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Leadbitter. It is interesting that the comment is on the record. It caused much merriment but it is a serious matter. In my opening remarks I said that the Government did not care that 1 million people had come off the register as a consequence of the legislation, and that they claimed that they had nothing to do with it. Now, however, there is a confession that the Government use the poll tax as a deliberate electoral manipulation to get 1 million, mostly Labour, voters off the register. That is electoral cheating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Janman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I made the sedentary remark that the hon. Gentleman alleges, that does not condone people coming off the register. It means simply that if people in the real world do so, I hope that they are Labour voters. I am hardly likely to hope that they are Conservatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that that was an implication of what the hon. Gentleman said, but judging from the merriment with which it was greeted, the Government are happy for 1 million low-income people to come off the register.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If what the hon. Gentleman says is true, the Government are making the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 542</span>
greatest mistake of their life in getting rid of the community charge. Only two categories need worry about the provision: one is the household where one person is living but where there are two names on the electoral register in order fraudulently to claim an extra vote. The second is the household where two people are resident who are seeking fraudulently to claim a single person discount.<br><br>
Surely the evidence of the electoral register is one of the means that the hon. Gentleman, as an honest, God-fearing, law-abiding citizen, would wish our society to use to prevent such fraud. If a landlord puts undue pressure on his or her tenants, the hon. Gentleman should be the first to join us in exposing that landlord and restoring the rights of those individuals to vote in the place where they live.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am wholly opposed to all fraud. But it would not be for me to take the action that the hon. Gentleman has described. It would be for the tenant, who would risk losing his home.<br><br>
In conclusion, there is no reason why the electoral register should be used in this way. The measure puts at risk the voting register and the canvassers who compile it. The list becomes inaccurate and it makes the job of the electoral registration officers much harder. The purpose of the amendment is to protect the electoral register, which is special and should be kept for the electoral purpose for which it was intended. It should not be used as a means to collect this tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will surprise the Committee to learn that I found the speech of the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) interesting. At no point, however, did I clearly understand how his comments related to the electoral register. I could understand it better if there were legislative means whereby one could prevent a person from doing something in this context.<br><br>
My earlier reference to the hon. Gentleman's interest in matters Scotch and not matters Scottish was not accidental. Discerning members of the Committee will understand the difference. The regional assessors in Scotland will clearly use whatever information they can and whatever information is available in the public arena. That will inevitably be the electoral register. The hon. Gentleman's proposal is absurd and reeks of Scotch. Unlike previous occasions when we have battled on the same side on Scottish matters, this time I find his proposals absurd, and they should be treated accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We heard from the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) that he had an eye test today and that he was on the mailing list for Conservative central office. We did not learn much more from his entertaining contribution to our proceedings. We noted his slur and attack on those million keen Labour voters who are deliberately keeping themselves off the electoral register.<br><br>
The amendments would remove the power for electoral registration officers to provide information on request to authorities in England, Wales and Scotland that request it for the purposes of carrying out their council tax functions. I believe that they are misguided for the reasons that my hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, north (Mr. Walker) and for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) described.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton argued that the use of the electoral register for community charge purposes has damaging effects, as people might seek to keep their names off it to avoid registration for the community charge. But even if that were so—and I join my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 543</span>
Member for Battersea in hoping that no member of this Committee would condone attempts to avoid the legal duty to register for the community charge—the position with the council tax is rather different. A local authority will know from the outset how many chargeable dwellings are in its area. It will know how many bills there are to be paid. In sending those bills it should be entitled to use any reasonable information to confirm the name or names of the person or persons who are liable to pay it.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North said, the electoral register is a public document. It would be absurd if authorities were unable to use information which was freely available to any member of the public to use as that person wished. No doubt the information is sometimes used in ways that those on the electoral register find annoying: they may receive junk mail from the Labour party or other organisations.<br><br>
If a landlord has a number of tenants, he must ensure that none of them goes on the electoral register for him to derive even any theoretical benefit. Any tenant in such a position could simply inform the local authority of the true position. No one can stay off the electoral register or encourage anyone else to do so and then evade part of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 544</span>
council tax without exercising a deliberate fraud. The local authority sends out one bill and if it is in any doubt it will send out the standard council tax bill.<br><br>
I must emphasise that keeping one's name off the electoral register will not enable anyone to evade the council tax. The authority knows that a bill has to be paid in respect of each chargeable dwelling. That is one of the benefits of a tax based on property. No doubt Opposition Members will agree with that sentiment. I say to the hon. Member for Leyton that there is nothing remotely sinister in the use of the electoral register to help the local authority in its billing functions. The register is a publicly available document. The hon. Gentleman may wish to withdraw the amendment but if not, I urge my hon. Friends to resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not happy with the hon. Gentleman's reply. I do not think that it will be as the hon. Gentleman says; I believe that there will be problems. However, for the convenience of the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
