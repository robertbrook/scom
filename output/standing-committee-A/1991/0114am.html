<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Transport and Works Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed with the business of the Committee, I want to wish all hon. Members a very happy new year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. This morning, the Committee will consider schedule 1. It need not take long because the points are material and tangible. However, as it is relevant to the schedule, I hope that we can clear up a matter, which, I think, I raised once or twice during previous sittings—the status of the schedule and its statutory import.<br><br>
Previously, when I wished to move an amendment, which was directly related to the schedule, the Minister used the word "illustrative". I queried whether any schedule could be illustrative as illustrative material is, usually found in White or Green Papers or ministerial letters, but not in a statute. Schedules are becoming more and more important. I would have thought that the adjectives "mandatory", "optional" or "discretionary" would have been appropriate. They could be applied to the Bill and to the wording of some of the amendments, to which I wish to draw the Committee's attention. Can we clear that up before we start?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Latham. I do not think that any confusion exists. We said that the list was illustrative, but not intended to be exhaustive because we thought that it would be impossible to make a comprehensive list. For example, we cannot anticipate all the subjects that future orders authorising the construction and operation of novel forms of transport development might have to cover. Therefore, it was not considered desirable to try to make an exhaustive list and to run the risk of leaving something out that we might have to include later. That is why we regard the list as illustrative rather than comprehensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Latham. I understand that a Minister might need to use or prescribe orders relating to technical material, particularly techniques, hitherto unknown,—maglev, for example, which, I think, is magnetic levitation—in relation to clauses 1 and 2, which the Committee has already debated. My understanding of those clauses is that the Minister has expressly been given power to make such requirements. I would like to know whether, where the contents of schedule 1 apply—I imagine that there would be works to which certain of paragraphs 1–18 would not apply—such provision must be made.<br><br>
The schedule says,
<br><blockquote><p>"Matters within sections 1 and 3"</p></blockquote>
That is very important. I am not being niggly, as some commentators sometimes think. The draft is not originally
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
the Minister's, but the promoter's—that is vital—which the Minister takes to the inquiry. We are now in unknown parliamentary and constitutional territory because, as I understand it, that the draft statutory instrument has always been the responsibility of the Minister. Now, as I understand it, under the Bill it will be the responsibility of the promoter. Has the promoter, who drafts the statutory instrument, and—or the Minister, an obligation to include the content relating to any one of the 18 paragraphs where it is applicable to the works?<br><br>
Although our proceedings may continue without a definitive ruling, the matter is important, because under the existing procedure for a Bill a petitioner can ask for such provisions to be included and Parliament may decide that they should be included. However, under the Bill, it is apparently left to the discretion of the promoter or of the Minister to decide whether to include any of the 18 provisions, or any other provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Latham. We are straying into areas that can be covered in the debate on clause 8, which deals with model clauses. Furthermore, I must point out to the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) that we have distributed widely the rules that we wish to operate under the various rules of application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) for his customary courtesy in advising me that he would raise that point of order, to which the Minister has responded.<br><br>
It is not a matter on which I can rule beyond the ruling already given by my co-Chairman, Mr. Lamond, at columns 35 and 36 of the Committee's proceedings for 12 December 1991. When referring to the question of whether the matters listed in schedule 1 were illustrative rather than exhaustive, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Chair must always make a judgment as the debate unfolds."</p></blockquote>
He reminded that Committee that
<br><blockquote><p>"it is possible to debate the Question, 'That the schedule be the first schedule to the Bill'".—[<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A, 12 December 1991; c. 36.]</p></blockquote>
Furthermore, the Minister has said that the matter may be appropriately debated under clause 8.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Newham, South will find that helpful. I shall not restrict him unreasonably in any comments that he may wish to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for those comments, Mr. Latham. I appreciate the difficulties of the Chair because, unless the Minister has anything else to say, the drafting of statutory instruments, which in some cases are equivalent to a 300-page Bill, is now unprecedented. I hope that the matter can be raised on Report or through correspondence, because that is the way in which a Committee should work. It should examine the implications of procedures set out in a Bill, but for the moment I am content to leave the matter there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter.</span></p>

MATTERS WITHIN SECTIONS 1 AND 3</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 32, line 15, leave out 'person' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'operator or owner of a transport system or of anybody or person prejudicially affected by its presence or operation'.</p></blockquote>
</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0689">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may discuss amendment No. 50, in page 32, line 25, leave out 'person' and insert 'operator or owner of any relevant transport system'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 47 applies to paragraph 7, which states that
<br><blockquote><p>'The protection of the property of interests of any person"</p></blockquote>
shall be included in
<br><blockquote><p>"Matters within Sections 1 and 3".</p></blockquote>
That relates to the listing procedure before the Committee of what lawyers term a "prejudicial affection" which, in colloquial terms, means that any of the works listed will create a nuisance where there was no nuisance before.<br><br>
My hon. Friend for Bow and Poplar (Ms. Gordon) was worried about the fate of residents in two or three houses near to the route of the Docklands light railway. They wished to petition the Committee considering the London Docklands Railway Bill last year because they thought that they would be prejudicially affected by noise. The result was that the promoters bought those houses and the residents did not have to put up with the noise. That is a tiny illustration of the huge principle embodied in paragraph 7. But the degree of that protection will no longer be at the discretion of four or five good ladies and gentlemen of the House, but at the discretion of the Minister—who can say to the promoters that he will be privately reprimanded by members of all parties if sufficient protection is not given to householders or farmers who are prejudicially affected. Under these procedures, that will be done in private.<br><br>
The schedule refers to "any person". Householders in Bow were, of course, persons, but a body could be involved. Under the London Docklands Railway Bill, it was not proposed to send the railway through Canning town, which is a great shopping and communications centre in east London. When asked why, the promoters said, "This is a developer's railway; we want to shoot right past those people on a bridge over the river." The London borough of Newham—not explicitly a person—then launched a successful petition and the station is now being built.<br><br>
I should like the Bill to specify whether a person could be held to be a body, such as a borough council or a company. That would clarify the position and avoid criticism or misunderstanding. Therefore, the amendment proposes to include in the Bill the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"anybody or person prejudicially affected by its presence or operation."</p></blockquote>
The first part of the amendment refers to an
<br><blockquote><p>"operator or owner of a transport system."</p></blockquote>
Such a person would probably be deemed a body, so the Minister may consider that insertion otiose. However, I include it because the promotion of a new transport system can affect existing and competing transport systems.<br><br>
I was not a great supporter of capitalist-inspired railways, but a petition was laid by an existing operator when a railway was being promoted. The petitioners maintained that if the new railway were built it would prejudice their business and the promoters of the new operation would not achieve a profitable business either. Far from having two successful railways, there would be none at all. Therefore, they said that it was in the public interest not to build the new railway. As we know, there were many shenanigans with Mr. Hudson and his friends.<br><br>
In the 1930s the Southern railway company wanted to build a line from Wimbledon to Sutton, going through market gardens and fields in an area in which nice
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
semi-detached houses would spring up. The operators of the underground electric railways of London, then running the tubes, objected because they would lose the track of the northern Edgware line and their business would be undermined. I think that the district railway also intervened. It had wanted to extend its line from Wimbledon to Sutton. I have got it round the wrong way. The district line wanted to go from Wimbledon to Sutton, but the Southern railway company said that that was its territory and did a deal. I use that as an illustration of the problems that can arise under prejudicial affection for an existing transport operator, who would have a specific interest in this matter.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
It is important that amendment No. 50 is grouped with amendment No. 47 as it is in opposition to it. Paragraph 18 of schedule 1 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The alteration of the powers of any body established by or under an Act of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
The Bill does not say what that body should be. The definition could be wide-ranging. It could refer to any Act of Parliament. Does that mean that under the powers given to the Minister in sections 1 and 3, he can alter the powers of any body established by or under any Act of Parliament? That would be an extraordinary power. That takes me back to my earlier point of order on the question of something being illustrative, mandatory or permissive. It must be permissive if it is illustrative. Is schedule 1 giving power to the Minister under sections 1 and 3 even if the matter concerns transport? I agree that the power may be confined by the scope of the legislation, but does paragraph 18 refer to any Act? We are back to the example of St. Bartholomew's hospital, about which the Minister had to agree with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman was also discussing amendment No. 51. Several of his remarks refer to paragraph 18, with which amendment No. 51 deals. It is not amendment No. 51 but amendment No. 50 that is grouped with amendment No. 47.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise, Mr. Latham, my eye slipped on the amendment paper. I shall desist from that argument and hope to return to it later. I was right in my original assertion about the operator or owner of any relevant transport system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of all members of the Committee, I would like to reciprocate your good wishes and wish you, Mr. Latham, and all officers of the Committee a happy and contented new year.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) asked about a matter being sorted out by the Minister and possibly privately. A public inquiry will also take place, where representations will be made in public. Some of the points in the latter part of the hon. Gentleman's speech relate to amendment No. 51, which we shall discuss soon.<br><br>
Amendment No. 47 seeks to provide a more precise definition of the circumstances in which orders might be used to protect property or interests of persons. However, by narrowing the scope of paragraph 4 of schedule 1, the effect is to exclude persons who might be prejudicially affected by the construction of a new tidal barrage. It might also be inferred that the protection does not extend to persons affected while the works authorised in an order are being carried out. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Gentleman wants.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
Amendment No. 50 would prevent the Secretary of State from making byelaws in respect of any works, such as tidal barrages, that interfere with navigation. Both amendments show the difficulties that arise from attempting to include in a schedule definitions that are too precise. I hope that the hon. Member for Newham, South will not press them to a Division, as both matters are covered in the Bill. We are trying to be as broad as possible so as to avoid the difficulties that arise from a narrow definition. A broad definition helps rather than hinders. Making it narrower would not achieve what the hon. Gentleman intends and would not be the best way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the Minister's remarks in connection with amendment No. 50, but my emphasis was on amendment No. 47. I confess that I do not understand the Minister's argument about amendment No. 47. I should have thought that the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"anybody or person prejudicially affected"</p></blockquote>
was absolutely inclusive. One can hardly go wider than that. Any formula that does not use that phrase must be narrower. I hope that the Minister will agree that that is a fair point. If he wants to ensure that the Bill is sufficiently wide that it excludes nobody, I hope that he will agree that the wording in amendment No. 47 will achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the other problem with amendment No. 47 is that it would not cover the period while the works were being carried out. The wider definition is needed to cover that period. A similar example was drawn to my attention in last night's Adjournment debate on the noise and disruption suffered by residents when a construction scheme was being prepared. I am interested in what the hon. Member for Newham, South is saying, but I am advised that the wording of the Bill is the right way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's remarks. I can well understand that during construction there must be some protection against prejudicial affection, even if that prejudice ceases when construction is complete. However, paragraph 7 does not provide for that. We are talking about interests that are affected both during construction and afterwards. Some of the petitions and problems that have been considered by Committees in the past have called for safeguards for the construction period alone. I agree with the Minister that there must be proper protection during temporary prejudicial affection, but provision must be made to cover every contingency during construction and operation.<br><br>
To show my goodwill to the Minister I shall not press the amendment to a Division, but I shall press my argument in the hope that the Minister will examine the matter again. Those of us who have been involved in the nitty gritty of private Bill Committees will want to see how matters work out in practice.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned public inquiries. Let us suppose that a person stands up at a public inquiry and says, "I think that the construction of this tramway will cause many problems for my fish and chip shop. People will not be able to get to it, there will be noise, and dust will get into my equipment." In response, the inspector may say, "That may be so, Mr. Brown, but unfortunately the order does not allow met to order the design or the period in which the work will be carried out."<br><br>
I do not understand how an omission in a fixed draft order can take account of every likely prejudicial affection.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
Only those who will be prejudicially affected can properly make a case. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will agree to reconsider the matter to avoid the problems that may arise if the Bill is passed as drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall study carefully what the hon. Gentleman said. His point is, possibly, covered by the fact that the order could be modified. I shall consider whether anything further needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 32, line 18, after second 'of, insert 'public'.<br><br>
Paragraph 9 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The making of agreements to secure the provision of police services."</p></blockquote>
I refer again to the mandatory or optional issue. I assume that under a statutory instrument in sections 1 or 3, depending on the nature of the work or operation, it will be possible for the Secretary of State for Transport to authorise the establishment of a police force. There is no dissent from members of the Committee or from the Minister that the purpose of this paragraph in a schedule to a seemingly uncontroversial Bill is the creation of a new police force by the Secretary of State for Transport. It is a tiny subsection of 300-page order. I want to know if it is a statutory possibility. It is no good the Minister saying, "No Secretary of State for Transport or any Government would think of that." I am asking him if it is a statutory possibility.<br><br>
Police in this country are associated in the public mind with the constabulary of Loamshire, the Metropolitan police or the British Transport Police. Few people know that the British Transport Police, which used to be the British transport commission or the London transport board police, who wear uniforms similar to those of other police forces, have a police station at East Ham station in the borough of Newham. They are important people, especially in policing the underground. They have had some success in reducing the occurrence of the sad events on the London underground system.<br><br>
Private police forces are not well known but they exist. Until now, "private police forces" have been attached to a public body. I am an east Londoner and a river person and therefore I think of the Port of London authority police. That extensive organisation was set up under statutes of this House when the Port of London authority was established. Its predecessors, the East India and West India dock companies and others had constables operating within the docks. Closed docks meant security for those consigning and sorting goods, which was not possible when there were thieves on the river. That was a perfectly proper form of "private police force" for a private or a public body.<br><br>
The Minister is seeking to give transport operators police powers. The Bill covers harbours and, therefore any port, navigable waterway, the complexes of the Severn barrage or the Liverpool estuary—they are all included in the scope of the Bill—could have a police force.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The Government's self-confessed, trumpeted policy is that those police forces will be private forces, run by "This, That and the Other plc." They may be subject to statutory forces outside the House. Statutory forces exist elsewhere. Such forces may also be subject to directors elected by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
shareholders or nominees in New York, Tokyo, San Francisco, perhaps by the Moscow stock exchange, if that continues to exist. That is extraordinary.<br><br>
Such out-of-Britain developments are almost in place. Should such a police force, run by a private company, be established? The Bill is not a Home Office measure, but it raises profound issues about policing in the United Kingdom. Some private police forces may not be tuppenny ha'penny affairs. They will not resemble the small police forces that were controlled by boroughs in the 1920s. If some transport operations joined together, perhaps in a century's time, there could be a conjunction of such forces.<br><br>
That might be acceptable if there was no controversy about existing private police forces. But the Minister, who is responsible for some private police forces, knows that there is enormous controversy about the status, future, operations, efficiency and competence of such forces. Yet he seeks to give them enormous powers, which would further complicate matters.<br><br>
I have mentioned the Port of London authority. The port of Tilbury is soon to be privatised—either today, tomorrow or next week. My point is not partisan, but constitutional. Conservative Members have written to the Minister about the future of the Port of London authority police force, which is a shadow of what it was. Under present statutes, control will revert to the port of Tilbury police—a private police force in Tilbury, which operates in that port. Other ports have similar police forces. It is a controversial matter. Inspector Tom Lund-Lack, former deputy chief officer of the privatelyrun Felixstowe port police, wrote an article in <i>Police Review,</i> which,
<br><blockquote><p>"warns against extending privatisations within the service".</p></blockquote>
He explained:
<br><blockquote><p>"Eighteen months ago, I left the Met to take up the post of deputy chief officer for the Port of Felixstowe police department, which covers the largest and most active container port in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
I shall not read the whole article—I hope that the Minister has read it—but some points are most important. The inspector says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite careful thought and research into the background of this post, I did not discover that I was to inherit a police force with no recognised training. No crime reports or records were kept as a matter of unwritten policy. No steps had been taken to enable police to enfoce the RTA 1972 (now 1988), although major sections of the Act had applied since May 1988. Neither had action been taken to ensure port roads and traffic signs conformed with legislation.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>No checks were made on potential police officers, except indirectly in the case of service personnel, regular and special constables, whose backgrounds were readily identifiable through checks by previous employers.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I also found that the police were controlled by and answerable to one member of the board of management. This person was also responsible for industrial relations and personnel, and faced an impossible conflict of loyalties."</p></blockquote>
That is what is happening now.<br><br>
In the issue of <i>Police Review</i> dated 29 November 1991, an article entitled "Ports in a Storm" said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Britain urgently needs a national system of ports policing to replace the mish-mash of forces and ownership to which privatisation has added a fresh stir, writes Sgt. Steven Clark of the Port of Liverpool Police".</p></blockquote>
I shall not delay the Committee's proceedings by quoting what the good Sergeant Steven Clark of Liverpool had to say. That is part of the current picture. Does the Minister deny any of the facts given by those gentlemen in public print at, I suspect, some personal risk to themselves?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
In the light of that, I should have thought that my simple amendment, which would insert a single word—"public"—would have some weight. I await the Minister's reply to my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Little did I realise that the debate on the Bill would range so wide as to accuse the Government, as the hon. Gentleman did, of having such Machiavellian powers. One of the problems of legislating is that one can always say what might happen while knowing that in reality it is not a possibility.<br><br>
The schedule would not allow the establishment of a police force. Paragraph 9 is about the making of agreements and refers to existing police forces, notably the British Transport police in this instance.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the controversy surrounding the police force at the port of Tilbury. I do not want to dwell on that issue; I have corresponded about it with many hon. Members.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman quoted a police sergeant from Liverpool. As I have not read the article, I cannot at this stage agree with what it says. However, I must point out to the hon. Gentleman that the Mersey docks and harbour board is a private company within which a police force has operated for some time.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of the police forces which operate in the trust ports and in some cases are independent and autonomous units.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) and noticed that most of his examples referred to ports. There is also the problem of metros. I understand that in some cases there are separate police forces for the new trams. That is more worrying because metros are not closed entities like ports, so those police forces will overlap with other police operations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A metro link may wish to ensure security and protection for its passengers, which is an important matter, but it is not under consideration by the Committee at the moment. The port and aviation industries are required to observe regulations made under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990, which contains directives on the security that those industries are expected to provide. It is up to them to satisfy the Department's inspectorate that proper measures are being taken. This is a wide-ranging matter and covers many issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said about the directives that have to be observed by the aviation industry's police, how will the same regulations extend to the policing of the privatised ports? My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) spoke about the great anxiety at Tilbury. So great is the concern of police officers there about the Government's proposals to privatise the police force that they are contemplating seeking judicial review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I might risk straying from the subject if I began to deal with the ways in which various bodies respond to the requirements of the Aviation and Maritime Security Act. All I can say is that all ports and airports are expected to comply with the regulations, which this Bill would not dilute.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) spoke about separate police forces for trams. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0692">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
am advised that such arrangements in Northumberland for the Tyne and Wear Metro system have been made with the agreement of either the British Transport police or the local police authority. I cannot say what arrangements have been made for the Manchester Metro-link. The hon. Gentleman probably knows more about that than I do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give the principles by which new police forces can be set up? That is what the Bill provides for, as I understand it. How will the line be drawn between what are reasonable areas of responsibility for the new transport police forces and for the forces that police the areas through which the tramways pass? How does the Minister intend the regulations to be used in future? It is a difficult matter.<br><br>
The Minister spoke about the safety of tram passengers, which is clearly the undertaker's responsibility. But what happens if a person lies across the track to prevent the tram from going forward? Will that be dealt with by the ordinary police or by the transport police?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish to what I said at the start of this debate. The Bill does not allow for the establishment of a police force, but for agreements to be made with existing police forces, most notably the British Transport police. Areas of responsibility will overlap to some extent, as will decisions on what is and what is not a criminal act.<br><br>
The intention behind paragraph 9, as drafted, is to ensure that certain bodies whose powers are controlled by statute, such as passenger transport executives, can, if they wish, include in an order made under clause 1 or 3, a provision empowering them to make agreements with another statutory body—with a police force—in order to regulate conduct on their transport systems. In contrast, contracting with a private security force does not need statutory sanction for either party. The proposal to restrict this provision to public police forces is therefore of no significance. Even if the amendment excluded the possibility of undertakers contracting with private forces, I see no merit whatsover in such a proposition.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister read out what it says on a piece of paper, but he has not answered the questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). I know that those who brief the Minister cannot anticipate what my hon. Friend will say, but occasionally the Minister must think the matter out for himself and answer my hon. Friend's questions. He is saying that a private police force cannot be created, but with parliamentary approval, a private body can contract with whom it wants. It can decide in Greater Manchester, for example, to extend the remit of the transport police and send them into all areas of central Manchester. The Minister says that such action requires the agreement of the transport police, but does it need the agreement of the police force into whose area the transport police will intrude? How will that mechanism work? The Minister should deal with some of my hon. Friend's points, rather than try to get away with reading out the brief that was prepared for him before the Committee started.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish for reinforcing my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
argument. I shall not press the Minister on current events in Tilbury, except to say that they show the problems that may arise in future with this type of police force.<br><br>
The Minister said that we are finding ourselves in surprising waters. He did not think that the argument would go as wide. I agree, and I must ask a rhetorical question: were not the Government aware of the full implications of the Bill? This is not a rhetorical question: was the Joint Committee aware of the implications of its procedural recommendation?<br><br>
The Minister may say that I have got it all wrong and that under the schedule a police force will be created and that it refers only to agreements being made to secure provision of police services. I concede that it is worded in that way, but let us consider an example. A tramway in Manchester, a Mersey barrage or a new TGV train from London to Edinburgh may require police services. There is nothing to prevent any of them from making arrangements with an existing police force at the port of Felixstowe, for example. Is there anything to prevent them from going to Securior police services plc? Some legislation about the police force may prohibit such an arrangement. But by saying that the schedule covers agreements and does not create a police force, the Minister has widened rather than narrowed the issue, because he can make an agreement with any body proffering police services in a free market.<br><br>
Has the Minister consulted the Home Office? There may be simple answers to those questions—that is what the Committee is all about. The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Cartiss) represents the port of Yarmouth, but the port of Sheppey must also be considered. As my hon. Friend said, railways, tramways and other forms of transport are even more difficult.<br><br>
The importance of a policeman is that he is invested with the office of "constable". I am told that a single policeman with specialist knowledge, in certain respects and at certain times, is more crucial than a commissioner of police because discretion is vested in the office of constable. The hon. Member for Suffolk, Central (Mr. Lord) shakes his head, but I am advised by practising policemen that that is so. The office of constable is important in policing trams, trains, stations and, especially, harbours and ports, where there is a concentration of liftable items. That is why the dock companies set up their own police forces inside the dock walls.<br><br>
The fact that the Minister can make agreements with any company, person or body providing police services is far from reassuring. It would be a different matter if the Minister were to consider making agreements with existing public police forces or those otherwise authorised by the Home Secretary. That would give some protection against the present position at Felixstowe.<br><br>
I accept that the debate has ranged wider than expected, but that is the nature of the issue. In the past, any policing or legal powers given to constables would have been included in the Bill. They will now go before town planning inquiries, which are not used to dealing with such legal matters. Deep in the bowels of a statutory instrument is not the best place for the power to agree to a police force. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the issues that I have raised and that his response will be made available to those involved in the public inquiries.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider carefully what the hon. Member for Newham, South said. I did not complain that his implications about the Bill ranged wide, not did I make innuendos, as the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) suggested. Hon. Members have suggested that a 300-page document could establish a police force. I explained that that was not possible under these powers. The scenarios painted of the wider context were incorrect. The term "police service" means public police service; it does not relate to private services such as Securicor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of that response, I want to press the Minister further. The Bill seems to be in danger of establishing a new class of police force that is neither private nor public. While other Ministers with responsibility for transport are talking about different classes of railway travel, we seem to be creating a new class of police force that will fall midway between being public and private. Will the Minister clarify that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what constitutes the "inbetween" class—midway between public and private. Perhaps it is a class for politicians. I have been asked for clarification, but the more I try to help the Committee, the more we appear to be getting bogged down in what is really rather a simple issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am getting bogged down, it is because of the questions that Opposition Members keep asking. The more I try to help them, the more they attribute to Government sinister motives. The measure is not sinister; it is intended merely to facilitate. The term "police force" means a public police service, not a private service such as Securicor. There are no powers to establish a police force. As the schedule specifies, "the making of agreements" relates to an existing police force, which in most cases will be the British Transport police.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 apply to all the operations of any of the police bodies that will be established?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Given that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Newham, South will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to make only a few comments before seeking leave to withdraw the amendment, but I must respond to what the Minister has said. I am reassured by his statement, which <i>Hansard</i> will show, that the public police force will be mostly involved. I wanted to insert the word "public" in the Bill. However, the Minister's assertion that in most cases the public police force will be involved does not exclude the possibility of that not always being the case. We have what I might call the alleged problem at Felixstowe, so I still believe that the wording in the Bill is not satisfactory. I hope that the Minister will think again.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned the British Transport police. The present position under the Associated British Ports and other parts of what used to be the British Transport Commission under the Transport Act 1947 is somewhat disintegrated. I do not understand the Minister's assurance about the British Transport police. We know from the Prime Minister's speeches and from party-political broadcasts that the Government intend to break up the existing transport services, and that that will cause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
problems for the continuation of the British Transport police. Therefore, the Minister's assurance does not carry the weight that he thinks it does.<br><br>
We have had a useful debate. There is still a case for inserting in the Bill the words "public police force" in relation to making arrangements and agreements, or the word "public" with a qualifying statement about the authorisation or satisfaction of the Home Secretary. I hope that the Minister will table an amendment later to reflect that point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 32, line 20, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'11A. The creation and management by any person of nature reserves.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take new clause 5 —<i>Conservation of flora and fauna—</i>
<br><blockquote><p>'In exercising any function under Part I of this Act the Secretary of State or any person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 24 of this Act shall have regard to the conservation of flora and fauna.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On of the themes of our discussions in the new year has been consultation—or the lack of it—between the Department of Transport and other bodies. Has the Secretary of State or the Minister consulted English Nature about aspects of the Bill that deal with the environment and conservation?<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
If full and extensive consultation had taken place, and the Government's statutory body had done its job properly, English Nature and other national bodies would have been consulted. Those bodies could have put forward proposals about how a firm commitment to conservation could be included in the Bill. That commitment is not there, and that is why we have tabled the amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 49 is self-explanatory. It seeks to include powers in schedule 1 for the management of nature reserves. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell the Committee whether the subjects listed in schedule 1 could be interpreted to include agreements about any land that Parliament may require as a condition of allowing an order to be passed. If, under the measure, land that is especially valuable to wildlife is required, and in view of the potential damage to flora and fauna, why does not the Bill provide for the establishment of a nature reserve elsewhere? That could be part of the bargaining process for passing the orders. I examined schedule 1 carefully and I could find no such provision. The Minister should tell the Committee whether such a provision exists in schedule 1. If it does not, the Minister should accept the amendment.<br><br>
In discussing new clause 5, I shall refer briefly to clause 3. New clause 5 applies equally to the powers that relate to the Harbours Act 1964 and to other powers included in part I of the Bill. Clause 3 provides that nothing should be done under clauses 1 and 3 that could be achieved by an order under the 1964 Act. However, that Act includes no duties relating to nature conservation. It is because of that omission that the Minister should take account of the spirit of new clause 5.<br><br>
It has been suggested in fairly extensive correspondence between the Treasury and the Department of Transport that the Minister or the Department of Transport could use powers for the conservation of flora and fauna. However, the correspondence from the Treasury
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0694">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
concluded that it would be ultra vires to do so. If that is the case—and contrary to the Government's repeated claim that they are committed to environmental concerns and nature conservation—in practice they have not taken enough care to ensure that nature conservation is written into the Bill. It is because of that omission that the new clause is so important.<br><br>
New clause 5 refers to the conservation of flora and fauna. However, the general principle could apply equally to other issues, such as the conservation of areas of natural beauty. That is an important consideration. If nature conservation is to be upheld first and foremost, why, as the Bill stands, does not the Secretary of State have the discretion to make an order on the ground of the necessity to conserve flora or fauna?<br><br>
We have heard a great deal about the way that the Department of Transport appears to flout EC directives. Unless the Minister says that he is prepared to accept the new clause, the Government could yet again fail to comply with EC directive 79/409 on the conservation of wild birds. I am sure that all members of the Committee are aware of the directives that provide for the special protection areas declared under article 4 to be protected. I have a list of the special protection areas that have been designated in England, Scotland and Wales. It is an extensive list, which covers large areas of the country, especially if applied also to the port and harbour areas. Significant areas of wetlands, which have been or could be designated under the Ramsar convention, could fail to be scooped up and brought within the scope of these provisions. We must pay proper regard to that.<br><br>
I have set out our concerns about the omissions in the Bill. I can envisage no reason why the Minister should not continue to do what he did before the recess, when he took significant steps to take on board our concerns—for example, on inland waterways. If he refuses to do that on nature conservation, we shall take up this issue in every possible way, including through European Community directives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall first deal with the question of whether there was consultation with English Nature. The answer is yes; English Nature has been sent a copy of the rules that have been circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Five minutes before the Committee sitting started, I gleaned the information that English Nature received the consultation documents as late as 20 December and the draft rules as late as 2 January. We spoke previously about consultation with the inland waterways groups and statutory bodies. Were they included in the extensive consultation on the drafting of the Bill? If so, why is there a complete omission when it comes to environmental issues and nature conservation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady would have been very critical if we had sent the draft rules to various bodies before we sent them to members of the Committee, as I promised to do. The rules are in the form of a first draft and they have been sent out for consultation. English Nature was widely consulted when the Bill was being drafted. I hope that I can answer some of the hon. Lady's questions.<br><br>
The wild bird directive directly affects the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is neither necessary not desirable to include that provision in another Bill. It is not necessary to repeat legislation. I wholly agree with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
Government are not opposed to her objectives. I reassure her that amendment No. 49 covers the creation of nature reserves, which is not a matter that needs to be authorised by statute. Even if it were, a transport-related order under this Bill would not be the right way to deal with that. The Bill is sufficiently wide to allow a promoter to acquire land, compulsorily or by agreement, to mitigate the environmental effects of the works by analogy with similar powers in the Highways Act 1980.<br><br>
For example, at a previous sitting the hon. Member for Bradford South (Mr. Cryer) mentioned the need to provide exchange land if public open space is taken under the acquisition of Land Act procedures. We have also discussed the matter in Relation to amendment No. 126.<br><br>
The European Community directive on environmental assessment sets out various topics that must be examined by those who are developing schemes that are likely to have a significant effect on the environment. The list includes flora and fauna as well as a range of other matters, such as the effect of development on human beings, the climate, the landscape and so on. An unfortunate effect, which should interest the hon. Lady, of singling out flora and fauna for attention in new clause 5 is that European lawyers might well argue that, as all the items in the directive are not listed, this provision seeks to limit its application. I am sure that that is not the hon. Lady's intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I distinctly heard my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) say that we should ask the Government to accept the spirit of the amendment. Surely the Minister has only to put everything into that clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think and hope that I shall deal with that point later. Even if the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish does not understand it now, he will understand later. I have a lot to say about the European directive and environmental assessment in relation to another clause.<br><br>
The European directive is of direct effect, so it goes without saying that those topics will have to be considered by the Secretary of State in deciding an order that will have significant environmental effects. Therefore, the new clause adds nothing to what is already required of him.<br><br>
I would like to speak more fully on the subject of the wider impact of environmental assessment when we discuss amendment No. 53. I hope that I have made it clear that nature conservation will be looked after under the new procedure, and that the hon. Lady is reassured. There is really no disagreement between us on that. The question is how it is to be achieved. I believe that it can be achieved under the European directive, which has a direct effect on the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister and noted that he said that he shares the Opposition's concerns about nature conservation. However, in view of his comment that the Secretary of State would have to consider the issues that are raised by the amendment and the new clause, I ask him to discuss the matter in detail with English Nature and the other national bodies before the Report stage of the Bill. From correspondence on the topic, I understand that the existing powers would make it impossible for the Secretary of State to be able to refuse an order in the interests of nature conservation alone.<br><br>
I can see the Minister shaking his head. Perhaps the way to resolve the issue would be for him and his officials to have extensive discussions with English Nature and then to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0695">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
reassure Opposition Members that he has taken note of our views. Indirectly, we are discussing matters that, under clause 3, come within the scope of the Harbours Act 1964. I understand that under clause 3, that Act would not enable a Secretary of State to refuse an order on the ground of nature conservation. I should like a written assurance on that before Report.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not my understanding, but I shall write to the hon. Lady to clarify the position on harbour orders before we reach the subject later in our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the assurance that I shall receive that clarification after the Minister's extensive consultations with national conservation bodies, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 33, line 1, leave out paragraph 18.<br><br>
I apologise for referring earlier to the wrong part of my notes, but at least I need not repeat my argument at length.<br><br>
Paragraph 18 is extraordinary. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The alteration of the powers of any body established by or under an Act of Parliament"</p></blockquote>
is a matter falling within sections 1 and 3. Some Acts need to be amended. At present, that is done in schedules to Bills, which amend ancient Acts, particularly those relating to railways and property. That is part of the private Bill procedure: one Act can be amended by a later Act.<br><br>
I have already referred to the relatively dangerous powers in the Bill that allow a wide range of Acts to be amended by statutory instruments. Those powers are contained in the clauses, so why are they repeated in the schedule? Can the Minister explain why they should not be removed from the schedule?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that, yet again, the hon. Gentleman sees in paragraph 18 a veiled attempt by the Secretary of State to usurp the functions of Parliament. He said earlier that setting up a police force would be one of the minor things that the Secretary of State could do. However, I hope that I can assure him that there are safeguards and that using orders under the Bill is not a way of achieving unwelcome changes to primary legislation.<br><br>
The schedule is simple. It ensures that applicants for orders do not have to revert to private Bills to secure minor supplementary powers that, from time to time, will be needed to put proposals into effect. The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) referred in an earlier sitting to the Henry VIII clauses and we agreed to change parts of them.<br><br>
Many of the bodies that will be applying for orders, such as passenger transport executives are "creatures of statute" who can engage only in activities that have been sanctioned by Act of Parliament or by secondary legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is just reading his brief. He is explaining why he wants the schedule to remain. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South pointed out that the schedule could go further. Can the Minister explain how the provision is limited so that a Secretary of State cannot denationalise or renationalise a body that has been created by legislation?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should wait a while. He gets so excited. I am trying to set out the context and to explain why the fears of the hon. Member for Newham, South are unfounded. I also hope to reassure the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. I am sorry that I am reading from the brief, but I should have thought that hon. Members would want to hear the correct interpretation.<br><br>
If there is ever any doubt as to whether a particular activity connected with a proposal in an order is within the powers of a statutory body, or where a minor alteration to some statutory provision is both needed and justified in a particular case, we want to be able to deal with that in an order rather than a Bill—be it a private or public one. I would expect that the scope of paragraph 18 would, in practice, be limited to technicalities rather than issues of great importance, for example conferring on a body the power to lease a system if it does not already have that power. It does not extend to constitutional matters.<br><br>
The procedures that will be set up under the Bill for publicity of applications, examination of proposals at public inquiries and consideration of objections by the Secretary of State will provide the opportunity for full discussion of the merits of a proposal of this sort. We have the added safeguards of the Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Bradford, South and, of course, the influence of the courts to encourage the Secretary of State not to overstep his powers.<br><br>
I do not believe that the paragraph will cause the problems that the hon. Member for Newham, South fears. I hope that he is reassured that certain safeguards have been put into operation. He is right that greatly to extend the powers would have serious implications. I hope to table amendments on Report and that my comments have reassured the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. He has told us what I predicted he would tell us. I understand why the Government want to introduce the power to paragraph 18; it is so that minor problems can be dealt with. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South asked why some future Secretary of State could not use more extensively a power that was introduced specifically to deal with minor matters. We wanted the Minister to tell us how the extremely sweeping powers in paragraph 18 would be limited. Although it is helpful when the Minister reassures the Committee that as long as he is Minister and his right hon. Friend is Secretary of State they will not use those powers in a wider sense, nothing in the Bill prevents them from doing so. How is paragraph 18 limited so that the power can be used only in a narrow sense.<br><br>
In recent years, we have spent much time considering matters such as penalty fares. The argument in favour of such fares was that the penalty was relatively small. Would it be possible, using regulations made under paragraph 18, to double, treble or dramatically to increase the penalty in penalty fares legislation? I see no reason why that would not be possible. Would it be possible completely to change the nature of any body that was set up by an Act of Parliament? Will the Minister explain how the schedule is limited in the way he wants it to be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schedule has to deal with the works proposals. It is not an enabling provision to go outside the scope of the Bill. Paragraph 18 would deal with

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
minor technicalities—possibly the right to lease where that right may not exist—and other matters that I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, I am not reassured by the Minister's reply, despite his polite remarks. People approach Committees from opposite ends of the constitutional spectrum. Those in Whitehall to extend their authority and the right to rule—all in the public good, of course. They do not understand why others believe that Parliament bestows powers on the Government to exercise on behalf of the nation. Any Minister, however polite, who does not take account of that view starts off on the wrong foot, as the Minister has done on this occasion. The Minister says that we are discussing only a power to tidy up minor technicalities and difficulties that might need smoothing out. He says that no one will worry about them. Of course, the Minister needs some powers to change such things—that is common to all legislation. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said, there is nothing other than the scope of the Bill to prevent the power being used for purposes beyond technical changes, drafting errors or the clarification of anomalies.<br><br>
I remind the Minister that one person's technicality is another's principle: it depends on its effect. The Minister's explanation was not convincing. He did not respond to my brief points about the power already existing in another part of the Bill and about the relationship of clauses 1 to 3 to the reason and purpose, scope and status of schedule 1. Clause 5(3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An order under section 1 or 3 above may—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) apply, modify or exclude any provision of an Act of Parliament (or of an instrument made under an Act of Parliament) which relates to any matter as to which an order could be made under section 1 or, as the case may be, 3".</p></blockquote>
That confines the scope not just to the long title but to the terms of clauses 1 and 2, which relate to railways, tramways, trolley vehicle systems or guided transport. That defines the scope of the changes, but within that scope there could be massive changes. I ask the Minister again why paragraph 18 is there, when all the powers that he requires within the scope are already contained in clause 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish for not answering his question about the level of fines. Fines could not be increased beyond level 3, as set out in clause 5(5). I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
I refer the hon. Member for Newham, South to column 132 of our fourth sitting on 10 December 1991. At that time I dealt with a point raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, South. I cited a case, which I shall not repeat, in which a number of things had to be changed, and I said that we would table an amendment on Report to cover that matter. If the hon. Member for Newham, South has time to study the matter further, I think that he will agree that the amendments to be tabled on Report will satisfy some of the points that he has raised.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not mentioning in my previous remarks that the Minister had said that some amendments were being prepared on this matter. I thank him for that. It goes to show how useful a Committee can be, despite what the textbook writers say. They are the Minister's amendments, but they arose from our debate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
For those reasons, and given the Minister's assurance that he will examine the need for repetition in the schedule, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 33, line 2, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'19. Scale maps or plans of the position, location and details of each scheme of work, or part thereof.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 114, in page 33, line 2, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'21. Any book of reference which schedules land subject to compulsory purchase consequential on any order made in pursuance of this Act.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 52 would require maps and a schedule of property affected by orders resulting from the Bill to be made available. A large cupboard in the Private Bill Office along the Corridor contains enormous rolls of maps, to which I have often had resort in connection with the London docklands light railway extension being built in my constituency. I have also checked the maps for details about the routes of the Jubilee line, which is to be built just outside the House, and of the Crossrail line, which is to go through the middle of the west end.<br><br>
Those maps are fascinating. They show lines of deviation for acquisition of property and the effects of works. The related book of reference shows with great detail and accuracy all the premises that are subject to compulsory purchase orders or other agreements. It even gives the names of the lessees when a lease on a freehold is involved. Both the maps and the reference book are very important tools, as most hon. Members will know. Unless similar resources of equivalent cartographic and statistical quality, in which are contained precise details as to the location of affected properties and their owners, are provided for in the Bill, the rights of both individuals and bodies will be reduced. Moreover, there will be obfuscation and complication in the conduct of an inquiry. The maps and reference work are essential tools for understanding what is proposed and for adjudicating on objections.<br><br>
Maps and books may not often be the subject of high level political debate, but they are of fundamental importance to this Bill. I hope that the Minister will agree to the principle that documents of equivalent value should be part of the order to be laid by the promoters of Bills.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question of what the applicant must produce by way of maps, plans and books of reference will be dealt with by rules made under clause 6, of which we have already published a draft. There should be no need for such matters to be dealt with in the orders. I refer the hon. Member for Newham, South to subsection (2)(b) of clause 6, which provides for rules to deal with the documents accompanying applications, and to the draft rules which I have circulated to members of the Committee.<br><br>
I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman. There is no attempt to dilute the information that is available and the rules will specify how it is to be dealt with. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will find those rules satisfactory and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I suspect that the Minister is not fully aware of the difference in substance between what he puts forward as adequate and what I maintain is necessary. I take it in good faith when he says that such a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0697">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
requirement will be made under the rules. However, we are discussing who will make that requirement. As drafted and as substantiated by the Minister, it will be the Secretary of State. All I am saying is that Parliament requires that those documents, in the customary form, be part of the order. What is wrong with that?<br><br>
Rules made by Ministers could be the equivalent of my amendment. Therefore, why cannot they be part of the Bill and be made a requirement of an Act of Parliament, rather than merely a requirement of Ministers who can change the rules at will or from caprice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot change the rules of a statutory instrument at will. We shall discuss later the possible powers governing those rules. I intend to accept amendment No. 25, which would enable that to be done by the annulment procedure. We are suggesting here the same rules that apply currently to the private Bill procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister has not yet grasped the argument. The rules of the private Bill procedure are the rules of Parliament. They are debated and passed on the Floor of the House, not made arbitrarily or at will by Ministers. The Minister referred to clause 6, which specifies:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make rules as to … the documents and information that must be submitted with it." Subsection (6) states:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"The power to make rules under this section shall be exercisable by statutory instrument."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is asking the Committee and the good citizens of Matlock—and of any other areas that his hon. Friends represent—to accept that the rules to which they will be subject are roughly equivalent to those of the private Bill procedure and can be exercised by the Minister by statutory instrument. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South pointed out on another occasion those rules cannot be prayed against.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister accepts amendment No. 25 to clause 6, that would bring the measure within the ambit of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would bring the measure within the ambit of Parliament to a certain extent—and so would be welcome—but it would not bring it back within the ambit of Parliament as defined by Act. My question is straightforward—why is it not possible to transfer into this Bill the existing statutory rules of the House in respect of the deposition of maps and books of reference? That is not a party-political point; it is a point of procedure that protects the citizens whom we are here to protect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Usually, my hon. Friend makes good points, but he has a weak one here. At present, the rules are laid down in the Standing Orders for private business, which can be—and are fairly frequently—amended to take into account the wishes of hon. Members and of lobbying groups outside the House that can exert pressure on hon. Members. I suggest that tying down a power on the statute book would go a great deal further than keeping it under Standing Orders. To my knowledge, the Standing Orders have been amended at least three times in the past 10 years to improve environmental protection in terms of the information that should be provided when a Bill is deposited.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but I think that he has misunderstood my point—something that he does very rarely on a procedural matter. I apologise to the Committee because clearly I went too quickly and failed to make my point. My hon. Friend said that the Standing Orders for private business are frequently changed following suggestions from right hon. and hon. Members, parliamentary agents, promoters and even petitioners. The Standing Orders are changed as experience requires.<br><br>
The rules are quite complex. Some of them require the deposition of maps and books of reference. I hope that I have taken my hon. Friend with me thus far. If we transfer the power to make the rules in respect of maps and books of reference to the Minister, he can change the rules and may or may not take notice of pressure from right hon. and hon. Members, petitioners, parliamentary agents and inspectors at public inquiries. The initiative stays with the Minister. At present, any member of the Committee can table a draft amendment when debating private business.<br><br>
We are changing the source of modification of the rules from the present system and transferring it to the Minister. My hon. Friend spoke about keeping this power within the ambit of the House. However, by putting it in an Act of Parliament—I am referring only to maps and plans—it is still under the control of the House in so far as that Act will have been produced and amended by the House. Therefore, the power is kept within the ambit of the House. I should have thought that my hon. Friend would agree with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it would be logical to keep the power with Parliament, therefore making the statutory instrument subject to scrutiny and amendment. However, it is also logical that it should stay within the form of a statutory instrument, which can be updated as circumstances require, rather than requiring an Act of Parliament to change it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend may enjoy going through all the maps at the far end of the Corridor, but it can be a cumbersome business. He must be aware of digital mapping. It should not be too long before all such maps are available in digital form. Assuming that technology in the House improves, hon. Members should be able to call up those maps on a screen in their rooms. If this power is subject to rules, that sort of change could be made by statutory instrument. It would be a pity if it required an Act of Parliament to enable maps to be laid in a digital rather than a written form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again, without looking at any particular member of the Committee, I remind hon. Members that their interventions should be brief. Hon. Members can always rise to make their own speeches, and on more than one occasion if they so wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I are having a fascinating conversation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span>: Order. Nothing has been said that is out of order, but I remind the Committee that we are talking specifically about scale maps or plans.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Latham. I accept that the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish would carry a great deal of weight if my amendment proposed transferring the existing handbook
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
of private business into the Bill as a schedule. However, I am not suggesting that—the amendment refers only to maps and plans.<br><br>
I agree that in future, with screens and digital mapping, maps and plans may be studied in all sorts of ways, not simply by physically unrolling large, carpet-like maps. They, along with standard weights laid down by a board of trade, or the weight of gold, are legal standards.<br><br>
Amendment No. 52 would insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'19. Scale maps or plans of the position, location and details of each scheme of work, or part thereof.'.</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 114 would insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'21. Any book of reference which schedules land subject to compulsory purchase consequential on any order made in pursuance of this Act.'.</p></blockquote>
Neither of those provisions would require continual upgrading or change; I merely ask that they should exist.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I have to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish that, as one trained in reading maps—as he is—and who gets private enjoyment from them, those maps are important to those whose buildings, property or land are affected. It is important that those maps should be deposited in places where they can be viewed. Maps and details of property are required for all planning applications. On this matter, I dissent from my hon. Friend's view. Can the Minister explain why the Bill does not require such documents to be provided?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The points made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish go some way towards giving the reasons why we are not pursuing the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Newham, South. The hon. Member for Bradford, South said that, were I to accept his amendment No. 25 to clause 6, part of the problem would be alleviated. He must wait until we reach the appropriate stage, when he may find—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course the hon. Gentleman was trying to be helpful, as always. I have read his speeches in the Committee, especially those on its timetabling and on how often it should meet, and I certainly felt that the hon. Gentleman was helpful. He must wait a little while, however. I had hoped to reach clause 6 by now, but we shall come to it soon—perhaps this afternoon—and the hon. Gentleman may then have a pleasant surprise.<br><br>
The best way to deal with the matter is that outlined in the Bill. No one is saying that maps will not be available; they and any relevant accompanying documentation are a vital part of any application or order. The matter will be dealt with in the statutory instrument that covers the rules.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish raised the matter of changing Standing Orders. The idea that it is easy to change even the Standing Orders of the House, and that somehow a Minister—even the Leader of the House —is not involved in deciding the business of the House, is rather strange. The allocation of time and the matters for discussion must be agreed. Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure that any business is not blocked by, for example, the Opposition Chief Whip or another relevant person. The Bill sets out the right way to make progress on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not think that the Minister has answered the question, he has placed before us the fascinating prospect of a revalation later. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 33, line 2, at end add—

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may consider the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 56, in clause 6, page 3, line 13, at end insert

<br><blockquote><p>'.—Any application for an Order under section 1 to 5 of this Act and any single scheme or work therein shall be subject to the presentation of an associated environment assessment required by any Act of Parliament or related Order and any such assessment as may be varied by the Secretary of State shall be regarded as part of the Order as required by Schedule 1 to this Act.'".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>New clause 3—<i>Environmental impact</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>'The Secretary of State may only make an Order relating to, or to matters ancillary to an Order under section 1 and 3 above if—
<ol>
<li>he is satisfied that the full environmental implications of any Order have been taken into account, and</li>
<li>a statement on the environmental impact is attached to the Order.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have grouped together amendments relating to environmental matters, Mr. Latham. I shall divide them into two sections. Amendment No. 53 relates to noise and other "environmental requirements". Noise caused by railways and tramways is a matter of constant discussion. I have already said that petitions were made and undertakings given about the noise caused by the docklands light railway. There have been written legal exchanges on that matter, several years after the railway started running—at least, after a fashion. The noise of transport operations may be acceptable at first, but it sometimes increases. Noise is important to those who may be prejudicially affected.<br><br>
New clause 2 deals with environmental assessment, which my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North has already mentioned. Environmental assessments were recently introduced on a notable occasion. Standing Orders were changed to introduce environmental assessments into the rules for private Bills. Environmental assessments will become necessary; for many people, they are the centrepiece of any application. I hope that environmental assessment documents will be printed separately, but also form part and parcel of the order. We must deal with environmental assessments properly and comprehensively. The amendment deals with noise limits, and they should be part of an environmental assessment. It proposes that a table should be included in schedule 1 to show the noise limits imposed by environmental assessments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 56 is also relevant to environmental assessments. It was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, who will speak to it. A clause that deals specifically with environmental assessment should be included in the Bill. That is why I tabled new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0699">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
clause 2. The importance of environmental assessments will increase in time, as will become clear in our debates. An environmental assessment will be an essential component of any order.<br><br>
Under the Bill, the Minister can make an order. However, apart from the rules that the Minister sets for applicants, matters relating to an environmental assessment will not be consolidated in a comprehensible form. A new clause to consolidate environmental matters is needed, and new clause 2 is a shot at that. The principle, rather than the detailed wording of new clause 2, is important.<br><br>
The Minister may suggest that the relevant provisions for environmental assessment can be found here or there or somewhere, and will be in the rules. That is not good enough. We must have clarity of legislation. We all fulminate about the difficulty of understanding Acts of Parliament and about legislation by reference. Let us make the Bill clear in its purpose and reasonably comprehensible to those who wish to know their rights. To achieve that end, a clause that deals with environmental matters under one heading should be included in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tabled amendment No. 125 on behalf of the Council for the Protection of Rural England. The CPRE believes that it is inconceivable that nationally significant proposals will not need to be subject to the process of environmental assessment, under European Community directive 337/85. However, the Bill is far from clear about the timing of environmental assessments undertaken for such projects.<br><br>
On Second Reading the Minister said that
<br><blockquote><p>"the draft order and supporting documents, including the environmental statement, will be available to Parliament at least two months before any debate."—[<i>Official Report, 2</i> December 1991; Vol. 200, c.44.]</p></blockquote>
In an ideal world I should leave the matter there, but we all know that this is not an ideal world and for a matter as important as this I do not understand why the requirement should not be written into the Bill.<br><br>
New clause 3 is a probing mechanism to try to ascertain what projects or works would require some form of environmental assessment before being approved. It is quite separate from amendment No. 125. It is vital to take into account environmental assessment for all schemes and works. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State has the discretion to make rules about environmental assessment. That is not sufficient to safeguard the environment and the quality of life. It should not be a matter for the discretion of the Minister alone.<br><br>
Some of the works carried out under the orders may be minor, but that is not to say that the implications for the environment will be negligible. Therefore, I do not want environmental matters taken into account only for those schemes that may fall under the European Community directive. It is important that this country reaches the stage where the same thought and consideration is given to environmental matters as is given to economic matters. All policy decisions should be accompanied by statements on their environmental impact. A duty should be placed on the Secretary or his delegate to take into consideration the environmental implications of his decision and to let those implications be known through a statement. I want to know whether that will be done.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I endorse everything that has been said already. We have rehearsed time and again this argument about the inclusion of environmental statements in transport issues. We never get to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow because the Minister always manages to avoid, or even to evade, the responsibility for including environmental statements at every stage. I want to press on him the importance of including in clause 6(3) the possibility of drawing up rules, exercisable by statutory instrument, for clauses 1 and 3 orders. If environmental statements are excluded and the Minister remains unwilling to introduce an unlevel playing field, we shall avoid those responsibilities altogether. Unless the Minister includes environmental impact statements in the Bill, no one will be confident that the Government have accepted the necessity for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A short time ago I promised to say more about the environmental impact assessments, before dealing with this group of amendments. It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I made some general remarks.<br><br>
First, we want environmental assessments of the schemes that are the subject of orders wherever appropriate—and that means most of them—because that is right. There is a long history, under all Administrations in this country, of taking environmental matters into account in works projects. While one might be critical of some decisions, it is difficult to make a case that the environment is ignored. Most of the recent discussions about environmental assessment have been about procedures rather than substance. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned the need for independent assessment. It is difficult to see quite how that would work, other than at the taxpayers' expense. The best advice to any promoter is to employ a reputable consultant. We welcome the formation of the Institute of Environmental Assessment, which we believe will go a long way towards developing good practice.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is up to the developer to choose whom he will employ, surely the person employed —however reputable—will want to please the person who has commissioned the work, rather than coming up with something objective. Would it be possible to have a Government list of people, with the Government making the appointments and the developer merely paying the costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is interesting. It is not simply a question of carrying out the environmental assessment and not querying it. Therefore, it will be in the developer's interests to ensure that the assessment is carried out to a high standard. Otherwise, it will be questioned and the underlying issue will come under greater scrutiny. The formation of the IEA is a welcome move as it will help to develop good practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there will be scrutiny. That assumes that the objectors will have the resources for double checking. The difficulty is that, often, an affluent body will have the money for the scheme, whereas individual objectors are certainly not affluent. It is difficult for individual groups to put together the expertise required at planning inquiries. If an independent body has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
not been commissioned by the developer, it will probably be easier for the objectors to say, "The assessment was very thorough, and we do not have to double check it."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is advancing some good arguments and I do not disagree with all his points of substance. However, I am not sure that a Government list would be a clever way of going about things. It would be difficult to police, and there would be the questions of how to get on the list and what happens if someone on it becomes discredited. Having a Government seal on it would not necessarily mean that such an idea would meet all the hon. Gentleman's objectives. This developing area will need to continue to develop very fast.<br><br>
Many of the projects that will be the subject of orders will require an environmental assessment as prescribed in the EC directive. As I have said, the directive is not a model of clarity. It is open to many interpretations about the precise procedure to be followed and those, among other matters, are being discussed with the Commission at present.<br><br>
We therefore decided that it would be unwise to say anything in the Bill; no specific provision is needed. However, to comply with the directive, the rules to be made under clause 6 will have to require the publication of an environmental statement in the form prescribed by the directive. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North asked for the pot of gold. I hope that the rules may be the rainbow going towards the pot of gold.<br><br>
Any decision on the orders must be taken after an assessment of the information in the statement and other information of like nature about the order put to the Secretary of State through the inspector or otherwise. Before the application rules are made, we shall need to consult the Commission to make sure that we have got them right. But any words on the face of the Bill on this topic would either be a statement of the obvious—that environmental assessment is required—or would go into detail which might be construed as limiting the application of the directive.<br><br>
I shall now deal with the amendments in turn. I apologise for dwelling on the drafting, but it matters rather a lot in this context.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already admitted that the directive is not very clear. He says that there is a chance that it may become clearer. The Bill could be operating in 18 months. The Minister may be confident that the Commission will move much faster than some of us suspect. Would there not be a major advantage for those who will be affected to be able to read in the Bill or the orders a list of things that must be done? It would then be simple to add the words, "and anything else required by the directive". At least that checklist would be available.<br><br>
It used to be possible to see everything required by an Act, but later Acts referred to statutory instruments and it became necessary to read those, too. We now have the Act in the middle: we have to find out what the EC has added and what is laid down in statutory instruments. As the Minister has said, sadly, the provisions added by the EC are vague. We should be able to include clearly most of EC's provisions and add the rider that there may be further requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my later remarks will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish argued that it would be possible to change the rules, but if they were in the Bill it would not be quite so easy. The fact that the provision has not been included at this stage does not block the suggestions made by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
On amendment No. 53, I assure the hon. Member for Newham, South that noise and visual intrusiveness will receive proper attention under the new procedure. Those matters are covered by the European directive. If it is necessary to include specific obligations in orders on those topics, schedule 1(8) makes it clear that that can be done.<br><br>
At our first sitting the hon. Member for Newham, South referred to the provisions of the London Docklands Railway Act 1991 that deal with noise limits. Since that Act was passed, the Government set up a committee under Dr. Mitchell of the transport and road research laboratory to consider noise insulation standards for new railway lines. We announced in November that the Government would prepare regulations to implement the findings of that committee so that noise insulation standards would follow as closely as possible those that are already applied to new roads. Once that is done, there will not normally be any need for orders for new railways to cover the same ground. I can make available to the Committee further copies of the press notices issued in February and November of last year, if that would be helpful, but no doubt the hon. Member for Newham, South has already studied them in detail.<br><br>
The amendment to clause 6 is unnecessary. The European directive on environmental assessment already has direct effect. However, there is a further problem with the amendment: it implies that the Secretary of State can specify the content of an environmental statement. He cannot; he must require what is provided for in the directive.<br><br>
Similarly, the amendment to clause 9 adds nothing to what the directive already requires.<br><br>
The criticism that I made earlier about new clause 5 might also be made of new clauses 2 and 3. They use words different from those in the directive—indeed, they imply that the assessment forms part of the order, is drafted by the applicant, while the directive says that the assessment is made during the consideration of the application. If the intention is that the recommendations in an environmental statement for alleviating the harmful environmental effects of a works proposal should have some force of law, the appropriate action would be to include relevant provisions in the terms of the order, and that can be done only by protective provisions or conditions made by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
New clause 2 is also wrong as it would require all applicants for orders to submit their proposals to environmental assessment. That will clearly not be necessary in some cases—for example, those that do not include works proposals but deal only with ancillary matters.<br><br>
I realise that the absence of explicit reference in the Bill to environmental assessment and the direct effect of European law is unpalatable to some members of the Committee, but what I have said about the effect of the European directive is an accurate description of how matters stand. The amendments should be withdrawn. I cannot offer any better proposals, for the reasons that I have given, nor is an amendment necessary. I give an unqualified assurance that environmental statements will

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
be required by the application rules, that assessment in accordance with the directive will take place and that the results of that assessment will be made public.<br><br>
I hope that I have allayed hon. Members' fears. A substantial section of the draft rules, which I have circulated, deals with this topic. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I am not as satisfied as the Minister might be. I accept his assurances that, somewhere or other or in some way or other, environmental assessments will be made and will apply where necessary. He has to say that because of other requirements, even if he does not want to.<br><br>
I am grateful for the information about the Mitchell committee. However, the general drift of the Minister's remarks was not satisfactory. The rules are not laid down with the clarity that is necessary to be able to comply with them. The Minister may say that environmental assessment requirements and the like will be covered by paragraph 8 of schedule 1, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The imposition and exclusion of obligations or of liability in respect of any acts or omissions."</p></blockquote>
That is a wide phrase and does not make clear what is essential. It may well be in the rules, but we need a proposal that is clear and does not unnecessarily bind the Minister.<br><br>
The Minister says that not everyone will be required to produce an environmental assessment. But that is not an excuse for not putting a question on a tax form. One just puts, "Not applicable". The same could apply in this case. Under requirements for environmental assessment, one could simply write, "Not applicable".<br><br>
We shall have to look at <i>Hansard</i> carefully, but the Minister says that the proposal will have direct effect. My understanding of a directive, as distinct from a regulation, is that it does not have a direct effect. An environmental assessment in a directive mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North requires the objective of that directive to be achieved by domestic legislation. Some link must be made by a statutory instrument, or, the Minister will claim in this case, by the rules under a statutory instrument. Cannot the proposal be clearly laid out in a clause in a way that is not restrictive and that gives us clues about where environmental matters will be found? The matter is so important that it requires a clause of its own. I accept that the Minister says that it is somewhere in the rules or in some EC document, but it should be made clear in a clause. We could consider the wording and return to the matter later.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment on a semi-provisional basis.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 66, in clause 10, page 5, line 21, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to raise the procedure for making orders. We have had the draft rules and a copy of the draft transport and works orders, applications and procedures rules which are relevant to amendments Nos. 55 and 66. I now hope for some helpful answers from the Minister, and trust that our debate on the amendments will give us an opportunity to pursue several issues that relate directly to the draft order.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The Minister's letter of 16 December was helpful. The draft procedure order gave us some idea of the Government's thinking, but questions remain. The Minister recognised that the rules are incomplete and that the Department intends to consult widely on them. Many organisations and statutory bodies have said that they want to be consulted and to have any available drafts on the issue. They want their views to be known. Will the Minister say when he expects consultation on the rules to take place?<br><br>
The Minister's letter states that the regulations will be accompanied by guidance to promoters. Will a draft of that guidance be available to members of the Committee? How will the consultation proceed?<br><br>
The letter stated that different rules will apply to different forms of orders. Again, it would be helpful if the Minister would say what forms he has in mind and how such matters will proceed. Minor local schemes will be debated in detail at different stages, but it would assist this debate if the Minister would say whether different rules will apply to minor changes such as small modifications to previously approved schemes.<br><br>
The rules deal in some detail with consultation. Draft regulation 3(3) would give the Secretary of State the power to issue directions requiring applicants to consult specific people in relation to specific schemes. Two issues arise from that: first, for that approach to be effective, extensive prior consultation between promoter and Department will be needed. That must be so if the Secretary of State is to require consultation before an application is submitted to him.<br><br>
Secondly, how will such consultation be achieved? Will the Minister say what classes of application and types of person he has in mind?<br><br>
Draft regulation 5 deals with the important subject of the information to be supplied with an application. Among other things, it requires an estimate, with a breakdown of items and of the cost of implementing the proposed order. It would be helpful if the Minister would say why that information is required. That is especially important in the light of anxieties expressed on Second Reading about the need for a clear distinction between the order-making procedure and the Secretary of State's role in grant-aiding light rail schemes, for example.<br><br>
The issues are directly relevant to the amendments which relate to whether the rules result from what may be determined or what shall be done. It would help us to decide how to pursue our anxieties about the rules, in Committee or at a later stage, if the Minister would say how these matters will proceed.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0702">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asked specific questions which relate to wider issues. I shall consider her points in more detail and respond by letter within the next week or so.<br><br>
The specific point made in the amendment was why we have used "may" rather than "shall".<br><br>
Notice of our intent is, I hope, already clear from the fact that I have made available to the Committee a first draft of rules on applications and objections. That version of the draft has been distributed widely for consultation by the Department in the recess, making it clear that we are genuinely open to suggestions for improving it and to making amendments where necessary. The term "may make rules" is not, in practice, permissive in the sense that the Secretary of State could decide not to make rules. Clearly he cannot do that, as it would be impossible for him to make an order under clauses 1 or 3 without rules under clauses 6 and 10.<br><br>
Before I deal in detail with the amendments, I should say that, in the spirit of cordiality, present in Committee before Christmas, we intend to accept amendment No. 25, which would apply the annulment procedure to the rules made under clause 6. That would give Parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the rules, which, I am happy to assure the Committee, will be made under clause 6. As the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) would say, if there is an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny we need to worry less about what is in the Bill, provided it allows us to do all the things we need to.<br><br>
Clause 6(1) states that the Secretary of State shall not make an order except on an application made in accordance with the rules. Clause 10(2) says that the Secretary of State shall not, unless the objection is withdrawn or frivolous or concerns compensation, make a determination on an order without first considering the grounds of any objection made in accordance with the rules. If there were no rules, he would be unable to say whether the objections complied with them.<br><br>
A requirement to make rules under clauses 6 and 10 would not work. For example, it would force the Secretary of State to make rules relating to any other steps which should be taken before an application is made. There may not be any other steps. Similarly, under clause 10, the Secretary of State would have to make rules on such other matters relating to the consideration of objections as appeared to him to be appropriate. There may be no such other matters. I hope that, with the assurances that I have given the hon. Lady about writing to her in more detail, she will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful to receive assurances. I look forward to receiving a written reply from the Minister about the detailed points that I made. I note the Minister's comments about the broad scope of the amendments. The way in which we proceed depends on his comments on the specific issues. I shall not pursue the matter until I have examined the Minister's response in detail. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 127 would specifically help national and regional voluntary organisations to learn about applications as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. I cannot speak for other hon. Members and I do not know what you can hear, Mr. Latham, but I object to unhelpful comments made from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am afraid that I did not hear the comment to which the hon. Lady objects. I hope that anyone who knows to what she referred will take account of her words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Latham. I appreciate that interruptions occur, but we sometimes have to put up with them.<br><br>
I wish to know what the Minister will do to notify voluntary organisations about applications. The Secretary of State recognises the desirability of regulations on voluntary organisations for issues such as definitive maps, statements under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, public path orders under the Highways Act 1980 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. But not all voluntary organisations believe that they will be safeguarded by the Bill. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Bill will safeguard them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7. I am concerned about consultation and about whether it will include bodies involved with footpaths. When a notice is put up, will it include a plan of works so that people who are affected by the diversion or closure of a footpath can see what is going on? Under the existing highways legislation, people can see displayed at the point in a route where a path is to be stopped, either permanently or temporarily, a plan describing the proposed change. I hope that the Minister intends that the same provisions will be included in the present rules.<br><br>
Which groups will be consulted? Will they include the Ramblers Association, the Peak and Northern Footpaths Society, and other groups that are normally informed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
about footpath changes under the existing legislation? Will a clear plan be displayed on the affected routes, so that the general public can understand what is proposed? I hope that the Minister will confirm that such provision will be specified in the rules. Although the draft rules are quite helpful, they are not as specific as we should like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise hon. Members' anxiety that the new procedures should provide adequate protection for those who may be affected by proposed orders. I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments that have been expressed, but I do not accept that the amendments add to the safeguards that will be achieved by a combination of provisions in the Bill and the rules.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members will accept that the draft rules that I have circulated cover all their anxieties. If they do not, I shall be happy to enter into further consultation and to consider possible amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Walley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have seen a draft copy of the list of organisations that will be consulted. Will the Minister accept a list of other organisations that should be consulted, such as the Ramblers Association?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. A very helpful list has been circulated for Committee members to consider, but does a procedure exist for the list to appear in the record? I know that the Minister could bore us all by reading the list out, but it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
a very important document. By raising this point of order, I am drawing attention to the list's existence. People would find it much more convenient if there were some parliamentary mechanism by which it could be included in the record in some other way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know of no such procedure. We do not have the ability of the United States Congress to read a document into the record, although the Minister may wish to catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can remember wanting to read my briefing notes into the record. That may have helped the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) that we shall be happy to send the consultation list to any body that she thinks should receive it. Moreover, the list can be put more completely in the public domain by means of an answer to a parliamentary question. That would obviate the need for my reading it out today, but Committee procedure does not allow it to be read into the record.<br><br>
Amendment No. 127 would not add anything to the sense of clause 6(2)(c). The draft rules that I have circulated among the Committee show that there is a clear provision about who should receive a notice of application.</span></p>
