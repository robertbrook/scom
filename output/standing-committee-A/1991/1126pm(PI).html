</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before we knocked off for lunch, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) was about to intervene, so I shall give way to him now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were discussing the problems of collection of the poll tax. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) can confirm that the situation is worse than he described it because the Secretary of State has refused extra budgetary assistance to enable local authorities to mount campaigns to get people to pay the poll tax. Indeed, local authorities that spend part
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
of their budget on take-up campaigns could find that they are subject to capping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and I apologise if I have been unduly uncritical of the Government on that point. The amount of tax unpaid totals billions of pounds. Local authorities have stated, as Opposition Members did in the Committee's proceedings last week, that there is a need for a major campaign to maximise recovery of those unpaid bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This amendment has nothing to do with the collection of the poll tax or any other tax. It deals only with variants of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Michael, a question was asked by the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) which required me to substantiate a point that I was making about local authorities' expenditure. Without going into great detail, I wished to confirm to the hon. Gentleman and to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West that the Secretary of State has commented that he would support take-up campaigns as long as they were funded from a local authority's current revenue estimates. That means that local authorities will have to reduce expenditure in key services to mount a take-up campaign that should be organised and paid for by the Government. I apologise for that diversion, Sir Michael but the hon. Member for Wyre, who is not in his place, should apologise also for raising the matter in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we broke for lunch I was dealing with a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about the need for a register if the discount system was to be fairly administered. Conservative Members on both the Front and Back Benches dissented from that analysis, as they did on Second Reading, when the Government said that there was no need for the establishment of such a register, even in principle. I should like, however, to draw the Committee's attention to a speech given on Monday by Roger Burton, who is city treasurer for Birmingham, one of the largest local authorities in the United Kingdom. He made it quite clear that there is an absolute necessity to set up a register:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whatever the Department of the Environment says, I'm going to have a council tax register."</p></blockquote>
He said that a register was essential if the new tax was to have any chance of working and added that in Birmingham a new database was needed if a discount scheme was to be introduced because the authority had been unable to update the poll tax register since 1989. He stated that a canvass was also essential to identify single-person households entitled to rebates, to identify students and others entitled to exemptions and to get the name of the liable person in each household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assertion of the Birmingham city council treasurer gained support at the conference from several local authority leaders, particularly those representing metropolitan authorities, who have the biggest problem in registering and maintaining up-to-date information about who is required to meet
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
the consequences of the poll tax and the introduction of the new council tax. In metropolitan areas many people move regularly in and out of authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Margaret Hodge, the vice chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, made it clear that where poll tax registration turnover had been high authorities would be forced into compiling a council tax register with or without the Government's tacit support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is about discounts. If the hon. Member wishes to discuss registers, he must seek other means of doing so. It is not for me to tell him how that can be arranged, but it is not beyond the wit of an experienced Committee man such as himself. The hon. Member must relate his remarks to the amendment under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Sir Michael. The rebate system relies on identifying a single-person household and determining whether that person is entitled to a discount. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham and I want to make it clear that if the system is to be operated fairly those entitled to a discount must be identified, so some form of registration, canvass or trawl is necessary. Without that, accurate information will not be available for local authorities to implement the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At all times I will abide by the Chair's ruling and try to ensure that I am not out of order. That is why I raised the matter in the way that I did, although I may have confused the Committee by quoting what a councillor said. I did so to show clearly that, if the Bill is enacted in its present form, local authorities will have to continue their former poll tax register or update it to a council tax register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points made by my hon. Friends in the previous debate are germane to this discussion on discounts. If local authorities are compelled to draw up a register to ensure that the discount system works fairly and well, and those local authorities are legally challenged, will the Government leave them to cope with the mess created by the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will correct me if I am wrong, but nothing in the Bill stops a local authority using its computerised electoral register, if it chooses. It is well within an authority's ability to tag single-person households and to use other codes that give local authorities an enormous amount of information, without creating separate lists for this or that. Surely the hon. Gentleman will concede that every local authority could do that if it so chose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that electoral registers are not the right vehicle for providing information on who should have council tax discounts. The hon. Gentleman has confirmed our fears that the Government want a hidden register for taxing people's votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if the Government want the system to operate effectively, authorities will be required to
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
maintain and update registers. The Government should legislate for that and provide local authorities with the financial resources to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) said that a local authority could have a second electoral register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the same one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but he claimed that local authorities could signal for single people who were eligible for a discount on a register. That would become the council tax register. The hon. Gentleman fails to acknowledge, however, that implementing the discount system will be complex. It will have to be administered on a daily basis. Someone could be eligible for a discount for only one day. As the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux stated, single people move around. It will not be as easy as the hon. Gentleman suggests to signal people on a computer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. On Second Reading, the Government denied that there would be a register. Consequently, they now continually deny the necessity for a register. Yet the Bill would impose on local authorities requirements for financially prudent administration techniques. If those techniques are inadequate, people who are entitled to discounts and other benefits could either be excluded completely or receive benefits to which they are not entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire (Hornchurch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the discussion about registers continues, it is important to tackle the point raised by the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen). The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy stated in a document, which I believe was circulated to most members of the Committee, that there was no problem with any aspect of the day-to-day calculations of charge, as set out in the Bill. It is important to put that on record lest the elastic system used by the hon. Member for Leyton be assumed to be normal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that Conservative Members did not heed the rest of the advice that CIPFA gave. If they had, the Bill would not have been introduced in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government used exactly the same methods when the poll tax was introduced: they quoted some limited points from a CIPFA report. The institute did not expect the poll tax to be introduced, but stated that it could be operated. It was proved wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are experts in asking for professional advice and consultation and ignoring it completely when it does not suit them. That has happened with the Bill. Many professional organisations have suggested amendments or fundamental changes. Every time we have tabled amendments and presented the views of those non-political organisations, the Government have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
rejected them and adhered to their narrow political ideology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount system is based on the assumption that if two or more adults live in a home, they can pay their bill. The Government argue that a single taxpayer should receive assistance with the bill, because he or she lives alone. That grotesque view was shown to be worthless earlier in the debate when Conservative Members, such as the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis), claimed that a single person did not utilise services in the same way as a pensioner couple or a family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall present an interesting general analysis of how local government services are used by single people, families and couples. I have based the analysis on a rough percentage of the money that local authorities spend on each basic service. About 10 per cent was spent by three separate authorities on transport and highways. It is reasonable to assume that a single person will own one car. The census shows that most families in Britain own one car. Pensioner couples usually use public transport and bus passes. Those three groups all receive services that are paid for by the transport budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 50 per cent of local authority budget is spent on education. If the Government have their way, access to adult education will be reduced further and further, but at present single people use the facility to the full. It is the general impression that children from five to 18 are the main users of local authority education services, but pensioners have access to and use adult education services that are provided for elderly people through education budgets. Therefore, couples, single people and families use local authority education facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Battersea) 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. About 5 per cent of local authority budgets is spent on leisure facilities. Once again, young, single adults and families use sports centres and other facilities, and elderly people use the swimming, rehabilitation and exercise facilities that are provided for by the leisure departments of local authorities. Across the board, all sections of society use parts of the local authority services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A quarter of the entire local authority budget is spent on the police and fire services. Single people, families, pensioners, women and people from ethnic minorities use those services. Given this Government's emphasis on law and order, members of the public are using police services more and more. About 5 per cent of local government expenditure goes on social services. Single people use social services in stressful circumstances or if they have a mental or physical disability. Families use the services for children. Elderly people require care in the home, community services, home help services and all the other facilities that can be used to help keep them for as long as possible in their own homes and prevent them from having to go into public or private institutional care. Therefore, across the spectrum of family life a service is provided and paid
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
for out of the general fund. The same is true of libraries and other facilities. The arguments of the hon. Member for Battersea do not stand up in practical or in ideological terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing that the hon. Gentleman has said goes against what I said earlier. Leaving aside children—we do not want to tax children—we are talking about single-person households and two-person households. The hon. Gentleman mentions social services, which go to individuals, and most individuals using social services will be getting rebates, but let us leave that aside for the moment as well. He talks of sports centres. Those sports centres have admission charges and one pays according to the number of people using the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right about bus passes; if there are two people in a household, they need two bus passes. That is precisely what I was saying; it costs more in a two-person household than in a one-person household. The hon. Gentleman refers to adult education. Two people in a household will take up two places in a class whereas one person will take up only one place. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is not denying anything that I said. I agree with him. He is showing that a two-person household is likely to cost the community more than a one-person household.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not likely at all. The hon. Gentleman obviously has not listened to anything that has been said. He and other Conservative Members argue that if someone lives in a single household, he or she should be less liable to make a contribution towards communal services that are provided at local authority level. That is patently untrue both in practical and financial terms, and as an ideology. It just does not stand the test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the report produced by Julian Le Grand from the school of advanced urban studies at the University of Bristol. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) tells me that it is the best place to study advanced urban studies in Britain. Indeed, it is where she did her Ph.D, which sums up the quality of its reports and the calibre of its graduates. Julian Le Grand's report showed that there was no justification for discounts based on services. Its survey of Cheshire county council showed that a property tax raised income roughly in line with the benefits of local services received by occupants of a household. That, to my understanding, is the only major investigative study of the concept that is being outlined by the Government. The study concluded that the Government's analysis of what happens in the provision of local authority services and the way that is best suited to raise resources was entirely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister really think that he can defend the position where a single person with a disposable income of over £30,000 a year receives a 25 per cent discount and a pensioner couple, possibly living next door, but at any rate living in the same band in the same area, have to pay the full amount? Does he defend the situation where everyone who lives alone will receive a 25 per cent discount, which will mean
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
that a professional person living in a home valued at £120,000 somewhere in England will pay a council tax of £367 whereas a low-income family living close by in either local authority or housing association property valued at £30,000 less than that will have to pay £490? Can he justify his support for such a discount system, which has all the hallmarks of unfairness of the poll tax that we are supposed to be abolishing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been referring to the department of advanced urban studies at Bristol university. Was this department one of those that in the 1960s advocated the building of appalling high tower blocks? If so, would he agree that far from being the best place, let us hope that it is the only place of its kind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not relevant to the debate. It is not an allegation that I have heard against the department. In the 1960s, Governments of both political parties offered grants to encourage local authorities to build high-rise flats, instead of having a programme of providing housing for working-class people. Both Governments got it wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman later. I have given way more often than the Minister usually does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are really interested in introducing a tax that is seen to be fair and a discount system that is not full of the anomalies that my hon. Friends and I are pointing out, perhaps the Minister will comment on not an outlandish proposal but on something that will arise on virtually any day that might be chosen once the council tax is in operation. This applies particularly to university towns. We discussed when considering an earlier amendment the position of university towns and the access of students to certain rebates and allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a group of mature students took the advice of the Under-Secretary and got a house together, and no non-students lived in the property, the group would pay no council tax. Well, fair enough. Regardless of income the four mature students would be exempt from the tax. I see that the Minister of State from the Scottish Office nods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not promote him: he is an Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is again trying to queer my pitch with the Minister. I pay him credit for still being a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next door to that group of mature students, there could live a couple, one of whose mother lives with the couple and suffers from Alzheimer's disease. There are 6 million carers in Britain—that is not a minority group. Thankfully, there are not 6 million sufferers of Alzheimer's disease, but there are hundreds of thousands of families that care for members of their families who suffer from that
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
disease or other forms of dementia. The age band is from the late 30s and early 40s up to those in their 80s or 90s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under care in the community, families will increasingly retain in the home members of the family who are suffering from severe mental disability. Such people will have to pay the full bill. As carers, the husband of such a couple could have a full-time or part-time job and earnings above the level for rebates. As a couple they will not receive the discount. Under the Government's discount system, four people living in one house could be exempt, irrespective of their income. Next door there could be a couple, who actively support the state by providing care, protection and nursing for someone in that family, who would fall between two stools in the measure—neither exempt nor able to obtain the discount in the way that the Government intended. The Government must make a clear statement about such carers before the Bill leaves the Committee. In our debate on 20 November, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One matter that perhaps the Minister has not mentioned because it may come up later—I am not saying that he failed to answer the question correctly—is that of a disabled person who, by virtue of the multiplicity of his disabilities, has to live with a carer. Do the Government intend to table amendments that would enable that household to be treated as a single dwelling household and thus allow it to receive the 25 per cent rebate?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point. I reiterate that I cannot give a commitment at this stage, but discussions are continuing. That is a genuine answer"—</p></blockquote>
which I accepted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it in the spirit in which it is intended."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 20 November 1991; C.152.]</p></blockquote>
I did accept it. We are now discussing discounts and have reached the point in the Bill where the Minister could give us an idea of where the discussions have reached and whether the discussions are intended to reach an agreement in principle about dealing with the problem or to allow the Government to listen to the anxieties of various organisations, usher them out of the office and let that be the end of the matter. Is the Government committed in principle to dealing with that serious anomaly and using the discussions to table the best possible amendment to ensure that the groups that I have described today, and previously, will be covered in the system? That is a reasonable approach. I accept in good faith that, at this stage, the Government will not table amendments, but the Government should be reasonable to me and other hon. Members and explain the status of the discussions that are underway, with whom they are being undertaken and the likelihood that amendments appropriate to deal with my points will be tabled before the Bill leaves the Committee, or before it returns from another place for consideration in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These points are not trivial but major points of principle for disabled people and their carers and vital to the concept of care in the community and the general thrust of Government policy on that. The matter should be resolved now and not left until later, as happened in previous legislation during the consideration of which there was an almighty row about Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's sufferers.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
The Government stonewalled week after week and month after month but were eventually embarrassed into doing something about it. They did not do exactly what was required, but at least they did something. We do not want that to happen again. Why should disabled people and their carers go through months of anxiety when the Government could easily end speculation by giving a specific commitment about their intentions towards these serious anomalies?

Will the Minister deal with the administration of discounts? My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham has resumed his place. He has a smile on his face, so I assume that the interview with ITN and the BBC went relatively well. He pursued the Minister this morning on the issue of how difficult the scheme would be to administer and asked how, in practice, local authorities would operate the discount system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask the Minister some questions now so that he can consult his advisers and answer the questions later. Will local authorities be required to publicise the availability of discount, if so, what form will the publicity take? Will a local authority receive financial recompense for the publicity? Will there be provision to backdate discounts if someone finds out about them part way through the year? That question is a throwback to a vital discussion which we had about access of information and people's ability to claim benefits. Will there be a system for backdating discounts if someone has good cause, as the Under-Secretary of State for Wales argued the other day?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will local authorities be reimbursed for the costs of administering discounts? That question is important because local authorities have suffered severe deficits when administering schemes imposed by central Government legislation. Local authorities should be reimbursed for the administration costs of the scheme. I accept the necessity for the Department of the Environment to keep a careful watch on reimbursement costs, but in my experience of local government, very few local authorities of either political persuasion would attempt to misuse resources specifically allocated to implement major changes in legislation. The Government have the ability through regulations to ensure that reimbursement occurs in a way that safeguards the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give some details about discounts and transitional protection benefits? The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation has raised points with the Department about the matter. I shall not rehearse the arguments as other members of the Committee wish to speak, but does the Minister know about the institute's submissions and what are his views on its proposals? If we are not satisfied with his answer, we can return to the matter and other members of the Committee can participate in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee forgoing on at length, but I have attempted to outline some of the major anomalies with which the Government should deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
raised several detailed points in addition to some general points. I shall endeavour to answer his detailed points later in my speech. He will recognise that some detailed points, such as the way in which the transitional relief scheme will work, are still under consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman repeat that? As I understand it, he still cannot say what the transitional protection arrangements will be. Is he saying that the Government have not yet decided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The broad principles of the transitional relief scheme are quite clear, but the details have still to be determined. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are aware of the representations to which he has referred and that we are considering them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the general principles which have dominated the debate. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said when opening the debate that he expected the arguments that I would use. He will not be surprised to learn that his expectation was almost 100 per cent correct. I repeat that this tax is a combination of a property tax and personal tax. The hon. Gentleman prefers to use the terms "roof tax" and "head tax". However, this is not a roof tax because of the banding system and its dampening effect. That is the difference: it is why I do not call it a roof tax, even taking into account the 50 per cent property element.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman consulted most occupiers and tenants, he would discover that a damp roof is no more acceptable than an ordinary roof in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am never described as being on the damp wing of my party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This tax is a combination of a property and a personal tax. There is a fundamental difference of view, shown by this debate, between Opposition and Government Members. The Government believe, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said so movingly and effectively, that it is unfair that a person living alone should pay the same for local services as a household comprising several adults. Opposition Members apparently believe that that is fair, although I shall come later to some of their amendments which suggest that they do not take that position in all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members say that any reduction in bills should be based only on a person's ability to pay. They do not recognise that anomalies can arise between people in different circumstances who do not need help through the benefit system. It is common ground that there should be a rebate system for those on low incomes. To put the debate at its simplest, Opposition Members see no unfairness in a single person earning, say, £15,000 a year paying the same as a household of four adults all earning £15,000 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the argument. A single person earning £15,000 a year will pay the same in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
local taxation as the man next door who also earns £15,000 and who has a non-working wife and three kids. Where is the argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our argument is that there is a very good case on equity and usage grounds for single-person households to pay less than households of two or more adults. The hon. Member for Dagenham asked why that principle did not apply to households in which three or four adults are earning. Theoretically, he has a point. However, the new system will be much easier to administer than a system which met the hon. Gentleman's theoretical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members say that it is wrong to base taxation on any relationship with usage of local authority services. That is an astonishing assertion, because that argument is the justification for the rating system. Rates were introduced in the 19th century because local authority services were directly related to property, so a property tax was introduced. It was assumed that the larger the house, the higher its value. Such houses therefore attracted higher tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a higher usage of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that was the justification for the rating system. Opposition Members criticise us for proposing a tax that contains an element relating to the usage of local authority services, yet they support a tax whose sole basis is that property is directly related to the usage of local authority services. That was why rates were introduced in the 19th century. I find it astonishing that the Opposition should take such an illogical position in relation to the discount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Maria Fyfe	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will also recall that in the late 19th century ratepayers objected vehemently to rates being used to provide services such as clean water supplies and sanitation. Those Victorian values are reflected in the views of many of the Minister's colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure how the hon. Lady's remarks relate to the debate. The amendments do not concern water charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was outlining the general difference between the two sides. I would find the arguments of Opposition Members more persuasive if, under the arrangements that we propose, there was no benefit scheme to assist people on low incomes. Of course the Opposition would have a case if that were so, but it will not be. I emphasise again that there will be a benefit system offering benefit of up to 100 per cent of a person's liability. That is additional to the discount arrangements, with the two schemes doing different jobs. There is no difference in principle between the two sides of the Committee on the need for a benefit scheme and rebates for those on low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other general point raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham was how the system would work, and what the responsibilities of local authorities would be. Whether authorities could assume a standard bill when billing, or whether they would have to establish
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
the number of people in a household was the fundamental question underlying the speeches of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make the position clear. Paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the Bill requires an authority to take reasonable steps to ascertain whether a bill should be subject to discount. That does not place on the authority a requirement to find out the numbers in each household. It enables the authority to issue a standard bill when it does not have sufficient information to justify issuing a discounted bill. If a household receives a standard bill, it can apply for a discount. If that is refused, there is a statutory right of appeal. The system is simple and straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds fine, but the tax is to be calculated on a daily basis. An earlier clause relating to England and Wales states that specifically. The discount must, therefore, also be calculated on a daily basis. Will the Minister explain the complications that that entails?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no complications. I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 4(5) of schedule 2 which places a requirement on a liable person in receipt of a discounted bill to notify to the billing or levying authority any change in the household which may lead to a change in discount entitlement. That is perfectly straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) asked me several detailed questions and I shall endeavour to reply to all of them. The fundamental point is that a student cannot add to the liability of a household; nor can someone on 100 per cent rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's first question concerned a student on vacation. I assure her that a full-time student will quality for discount throughout his or her course, even during the vacation, whether it is the summer, Christmas or Easter vacation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's reply, but can he make it absolutely clear that if a student is registered for the purposes of 100 per cent rebate in one authority and returns home to live with a single parent during the vacation in a different local authority, that student will still count as a student regardless of what he does in the vacation? Will he remain invisible for the 25 per cent discount that is given automatically to the single parent by virtue of being the only paying adult; and, unlike under the poll tax, will the rebate be carried over for all vacations regardless of where the student is actually resident?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the hon. Lady is yes and yes. I could not have been clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's short answer saved a lot of other problems. The Minister was criticised for his earlier remark that the schedules place a duty on a person to notify the change of circumstances to the local authority. Was not that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
the arrangement under the old rating system, and surely it must be a feature of the Labour party's proposed rates system? The onus must be on the resident to notify a change of circumstances, otherwise no system of local taxation would work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but the hon. Lady put it in a slightly different way. She asked whether a single mother would be required to tell the local authority when her daughter came home for a vacation. There will be no such requirement because the daughter's visit will not affect the council tax bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If someone over the age of 18 leaves school in June to take up a place on a university or college course and becomes a student in September or October, does the discount begin when he leaves school or when he starts at university?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked a reasonable question. I am not suggesting that that is an enormous surprise to the Committee, but some of his points are more reasonable than others. He is referring to what is called the student gap. We aim to ensure that there is no student gap between school and university. Young people who leave school in July and go to university or college in October will qualify for discounts. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South also asked me about a student's position at the end of a course. Eligibility for discount will stop when the course ends—in, say, June or July. If the student was on income support, the mother can claim a second adult rebate of 25 per cent, which will be equal to the discount. I hope that that has answered the issues raised by the hon. Lady. When the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of our proceedings is available, I shall read her remarks in detail to see whether I should make any additional points to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention on the speech of the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen), the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) referred to garages. A separate garage that does not form part of a larger dwelling will not be subject to the council tax. However, separate garages that are more than 25 sq m in area may be subject to the non-domestic rate, but only if they are not used wholly or mainly to accommodate private cars. If they are used for other purposes, they could be subject to a non-domestic rate. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that a garage, which measures 25 sq m will be exempt from the charges. I was referring to garages measuring more than that, such as a double garage used for no other purpose than to house private cars. How will the scheme apply to such garages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A garage that is separate from the dwelling and more than 25 sq m in area may be subject to non-domestic rates. A double garage would measure that size, but it would be subject to non-domestic rates only if it were not used wholly or mainly for private cars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; In all towns, local authorities have built garages away from houses and they are rented to tenants as separate units. I have been advised that such garages would be assessed separately as residences. I accept the Minister's clarification that, if the garages were not used for domestic purposes, they will be subject to the business rate. But how will the system apply to large garages that are used by people who are resident in houses in the locality, and who use the garages for no purposes other than housing their cars?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to answer questions as simply and as clearly as I can. Subject to being advised to the contrary, I am fairly sure that, in such circumstances, those garages would not be taxed. They would not be subject to non-domestic rates because they were used wholly or mainly to accommodate private cars. It would be different if the garages were being used to house business vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's clarification. We are being told that a double garage that is separate from the hereditament will not be taxed, but that a double garage that is attached to the hereditament, which will increase the value of the property and take it into a higher band, will be taxed. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. A separate garage with an area of less than 25 sq m will not be taxed. A separate garage with an area greater than 25 sq m, which is used wholly or mainly for housing a private car, would not be taxed either. However, a separate garage used for a business purpose would be, I think, at least in principle, subject to non-domestic rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A double garage at the side of a house will form part of the capital value of that property and will affect its banding allocation. How can the property owner get the double garage withdrawn from the valuation in order to conform to the scheme that has just been outlined? How far from the property must the garage be for it not to form part of the property for the purposes of valuation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate has gone a long way off the subject. Perhaps we could now get back to the amendment. There are other parts of the Bill in the context of which this matter may be discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long exchange on the subject of garages, and we have made considerable progress in clarifying the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members—in particular, the hon. Member for Makerfield—asked me what will happen to carers. There will be discounts for certain carers. I refer the hon. Gentlemen to paragraph 9 of schedule 1. We have already said that the carers involved will include those who are exempt from the community charge. Various groups have suggested that the definition of carer should be extended for the purposes of obtaining discounts. That was essentially the point made by the hon. Member for Makerfield. The Government are prepared to consider specific suggestions for extending the definition; we are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
waiting for them to be submitted. However, no amendment to the Bill will be necessary if the representations result in the definition being extended. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened intently to the Minister and accept in good faith that that is the position as he understands it. But it does not cover what has been said by organisations for the disabled. The Government are clearly still committed to maintaining the situation as it is under the community charge, whereby disabled people and carers fall in to the trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should make the Government accept— everyone else does; it is not a party-political point— that certain anomalies were thrown up by the community charge. The Bill should iron out or remove those anomalies. That should not cause the Government any political problems. The Minister seemed to suggest that he did not accept that the scheme was seriously deficient, even though he is still involved in discussions on it. The scheme is deficient. The discussions that are taking place are about rectifying those deficiencies, but that is not quite what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to split hairs endlessly, but I shall answer the hon. Gentleman as accurately as I can. Firstly, there will be discounts for certain carers. Secondly, we have said that carers will include those who are exempt from the community charge. Thirdly—the hon. Gentleman is right—various groups have suggested that the definition of carer should be extended for the purposes of discounts. We are prepared to consider specific suggestions for extending the definition and are waiting for all of them to be submitted. Once decisions are reached on that, an amendment to the Bill will not be required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is saying that an amendment to the Bill is not required, he is automatically excluding couples who are carers, perhaps looking after someone with Alzheimer's disease or a person who is severely mentally impaired. By saying that there will be no adjustment to the Bill before he has consulted and discussed the definition of carers, he is excluding couples from the discount. Will he reconsider the matter, because an amendment may be needed to allow couples to have the discount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be sensible to agree to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that I should reconsider the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) and other hon. Members asked about publicising the availability of discounts. It will be open to local authorities to publicise them if they wish, but there will be no obligation on them to do so in any particular way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Access to and availability of discounts are important matters. Irrespective of our
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
views on them, if the Bill becomes law we have an obligation to ensure that those who are entitled to discounts should receive them. A laissez-faire, leave-it-to-the-market-place philosophy is wrong, because if the Government have deemed in legislation that there shall be a benefit, whatever its form and however inadequate it may be, they are obliged to ensure that those who are to administer it provide access to information about it. The least the Government should do is either produce materials that can be purchased from local authorities as a job lot, or ensure that materials produced by local authorities are adequate for the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are entitled to the discounts in the constituency Of the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) may not get leaflets of the same quality as those that they could obtain from my local authority. Equally, other local authorities may be able to provide an even better quality of leaflet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have that change, it will not cost the Government a penny to ensure that materials which are produced provide people with good quality information, whether they live in Wigan in the northwest or in Harrow or London. That would be a common sense approach to the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making two slightly different points. Of course, he is right to say that there is an obligation to ensure that people who are eligible for discounts are made aware of that fact. Indeed, there is a general obligation on the Government to ensure that people who are eligible for benefits are made aware of them. However, he asked me a detailed and slightly separate question about obligations on local authorities. It will be open to them to publicise the availability of discounts if they so wish—so I hope that I have answered that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield also asked about the backdating of discounts. If someone receives a bill which is not discounted, he may ask a local authority to grant him one. The discount will apply to every day in the year in which the conditions in clause 11 are met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that 12 months from the date on which the application is made or is it within the financial year? There may be a difference between 12 calendar months and the financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. If an individual receives a bill that is not discounted, he can ask the local authority to grant him a discount. The discount will apply to every day in the year for which the conditions in clause 11 are met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The calendar year or the financial year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The financial year; it cannot be the calendar year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have asked several detailed questions, which I have endeavoured to answer and on which I hope that they are reassured. On the point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
of substance—that it is fair and equitable for single persons in any household to pay 25 per cent less council tax than couples or other households with two or more adults above the benefit level—there is a clear difference of view between Conservative and Labour Members. The argument in favour of the personal discount is one of principle. It has been vigorously advanced by my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked another question about how local authorities will be reimbursed for the cost of administering discounts. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not want to answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities will be reimbursed within the rate support grant settlement. I believe that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment made a relevant announcement on that today. It has been made clear that authorities in Scotland will be reimbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield has interrupted the flow of my last three or four sentences. I do not blame him for that. I simply repeat that I hope that hon. Members have been reassured by the specific answers to the several legitimate questions that they asked. A fundamental matter of principle is at stake in the amendments and if the hon. Member for Dagenham pushes them to a Division, as he suggested that he will, I shall urge my hon. Friends to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and useful debate. The Under-Secretary did his honest best to answer some of the questions that he had been asked. Unfortunately, that honest best was not good enough. He did not elucidate the principle that underlies the Bill or give clear, practical answers. I do not blame him, especially on the latter point. Clear, practical answers simply do not exist at present. It might have been easier for the Committee if the hon. Gentleman had simply said that the Government did not yet know, because they had not yet framed the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that we heard from Conservative Members has led us to understand or to support the principle of the tax any more than we did at the outset. Our view that the whole ramshackle edifice is likely to cause huge practical problems has been confirmed. The tax is in a state of great confusion, and reminds me of nothing so much as the same stage in the preparation of the poll tax. In some ways, the council tax is worse, because of the confusion and administrative complexity that it threatens to cause local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have witnessed much confusion on the part of Conservative Members—in the Under-Secretary's speech and in some Conservative Back-Bench contributions. They constantly said that the big difference between Labour and Conservative Members was that Conservative Members thought that it was fair that a one-person household should not pay the same as a two-person household, but they could never quite explain what that fairness consisted of. Not surprisingly, the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker)—who was entirely in
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
line with every Conservative Member who spoke on the subject, including the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis)—was inclined to express that concept of fairness in terms of ability to pay. He seemed unaware that the Under-Secretary had constantly rebutted that suggestion in an earlier debate, saying that it had nothing to do with ability to pay or with income. So fairness does not consist of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North is the only Conservative Member so far to have stated that he remains a supporter of the community charge. So much a supporter is he that he refuses to call it the poll tax. I think that virtually everybody else has used the dread phrase—I expect the hon. Gentleman to intervene, and I shall certainly give way in a moment—but he refuses to let the dread phrase pass his lips. The only thing on which he seemed a little less than certain—perhaps he would like to intervene on this point—was when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) asked if his undying support for the poll tax included undying support for the 20 per cent contribution rule. I was not aware whether he answered that question. Perhaps he would like to do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be aware that Mr. Speaker ruled on the correct terminology for that tax. He said clearly that it was as in the Act. It is the community charge, whatever the hon. Gentleman may call it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would now answer the 20 per cent question. Does he support that also?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice a rather surprising coyness in the hon. Gentleman. We all understand why he should be reluctant to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, perhaps he will answer it again, to put us out of our misery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was obviously not in the Room when I answered. In my paper, to which I drew attention and which the hon. Gentleman has not read, I recommended the transfer of a substantial part of the community charge to value added tax. That being done, one could completely scrap such rules and everyone would pay the same amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly recall the hon. Gentleman referring us to that unread paper. But he did not make that point as clear then as he has now. We gather that although the hon. Gentleman remains an undying supporter of the poll tax, he is so keen on it that he would rather double the recent increase in the rate of VAT to get rid of it. Once again, some Conservative Members are inconsistent. They profess undying allegiance to the poll tax but when pressed on one or more aspects of it they refer us to articles in which we read of comprehensive proposals
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
for sweeping away the tax altogether. On the question of what to call the tax, the hon. Gentleman might like to consult his hon. Friends on the Front Bench, who do not have the same respect for Mr. Speaker's ruling and are quite happy to call the charge the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument being developed by some Tory Back Benchers, that all local government services should somehow be paid directly by central Government, runs counter to the argument used against the rates: that only a small percentage of the population paid the bills and that there was no accountability. Now some Conservative Members are suggesting that nobody should pay local taxes. Where is accountability now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am in a difficulty. I was not present this morning, but on the face of" it, this matter seems to be well beyond the bounds of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you are right, Sir Michael. I refer merely to the fact that the hon. Member for Tayside, North raised the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the remarks of the under-Secretary of State for Scotland. He, too, had a shot at explaining why it was unfair that one person rather than two should pay a particular bill. The hon. Gentleman is at least more certain than some Conservative Back Benchers about rejecting the notion that fairness has anything to do with income or ability to pay. He may again indicate by nodding vigorously that, unlike the rebates or benefits, the discount system has nothing whatever to do with income or ability to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has nothing to do with the problem of people on low incomes. That is dealt with through the rebate system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we are not talking about people's ability to pay the bill. The Minister and I would agree that that problem is much better dealt with by rebates. We are looking for another concept of fairness, which is not to do with the ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next suggestion is that the discount has something to do with the demand for services. At this point, we had difficulty in following the Minister's argument. He has argued for a long time that the great deficiency of the rating system was that it had nothing to do with demand for services; it was a crude, blunt measure of what people should pay and should be rejected on those grounds. He has expressed that view many times, as have many other Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, unless my ears betrayed me, I thought that I heard the hon. Gentleman express exactly, the opposite argument—that somehow the rates were a prime example of a tax directly related to demand for services. He said that that was the whole purpose of the rates, that that is why they came into being and that there was a direct connection between property and services that justified the rates. He then asked how the Opposition could object to that
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
principle being applied to the council tax. That is an amazing about-turn. The rates, which were thrown out because they were unresponsive to demand, are now put forward as the epitome of that principle. Tomorrow or the following day, the hon Gentleman read 	<i>Hansard</i> and worked out what he intended to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I thought that it was absurd for the Opposition to criticise the council tax on the basis that it contains an element that broadly relates to usage of services, when the historic basis of the tax that they support was its relation to usage of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman sees the difficulty of his circular argument. The problem is that, having deflected one line of criticism, he does nothing to substantiate the application of the principal in this case. If liability for taxation was to be fixed to agree with demand for services, we would not do it in this way. The legislation is far too crude. As we have established on many occasions, the demand for services has little to do with the number of people liable to pay the tax. If demand for services had anything to do with numbers in households, why stop at the difference between one and two?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another suggested basis of fairness is that there is somehow a magic in numbers. Without relating the tax to income or demand for services, the proposition is that it is unfair that one person should pay as much as two. That leaves the problem, which the Minister admitted was a real one, that it takes no account of households with three, four or five adults. The hon. Gentleman avoided that point on the grounds of— hey, presto—administrative complexity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will agree that the tax will take no account of the fact that a three or four-person household may have only one earner and one income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and that point shows up some of the inconsistencies of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but until four or five years ago the House agreed that one of the unfairnesses of the rating system was that it took no account of how many people lived in a house. For years there was no disagreement. If the hon. Gentleman is now saying that that was no part of the Labour party's concept of unfairness, what did the Leader of the Opposition mean when he said that the rates were unjust? What did the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) mean when he said that the rates were irrational? The vice-chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, Margaret Hodge, said that the rates were detested. Those are distinguished people. What did they mean when they said that the rates were unfair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that these are difficult matters to follow. The hon. Gentleman has not quite grasped that if it is postulated that it is unfair for one person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
to pay as much as two, one must explain what is unfair. We are clear about that? It is unfair, and help is required, if one person is short of money and has to pay the same as a two, three or four-person household. That is why I challenged the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) when we crossed swords earlier to vote for amendment No. 128, which tackles the problem of pensioners living alone—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is arguing for a single pensioner premium, he surely concedes the principle behind the discount proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. This is mearly a manifestation of the unfairness that we are prepared to identify—the unfairness, broadly speaking, that single pensioners will face because of their lack of income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A single pensioner millionaire will qualify for the hon. Gentleman's premium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, although he has not yet seen the detail of our proposals. The unfairness about which we are concerned and which we identify in our amendments is based on income and the ability to pay. That is the principle that we seek to apply. The Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Nottingham, South seem unable, in the absence of such a criterion, to state what the unfairness is. It cannot simply be numbers or the demand for services, so what is the basis of the discount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that he accepts the argument for some single people—that is, single pensioners. If his argument applies to single pensioners, why does it not apply to widows with three or four children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept the argument so often advanced by Conservative Members that the majority of single pensioners are likely to find it difficult to pay a very large bill. No one pretends that we will strike it right in very case. We would differentiate between single people who are not means tested and single pensioners who, by and large, need help. That is why we shall offer help and why we shall be interested to know whether Conservative Members will vote for the amendment. In the absence of such a criterion, we are left in the dark, not knowing the basis of this complicated, confused, difficult-to-administer discount. We are told only that it is unfair that one person should pay more than, or as much as two, but we are offered no explanation for that unfairness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up a point made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. In doing so, I shall apologise to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) if he can prove me wrong and I hope that he will apologise if I am right—we do not have the last five years of 	<i>Hansard</i> at our fingertips to check. At no time, when criticising the old rating system, did any Labour Front-Bench
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
spokesmen disagree with Conservative Members in their belief that one unfairness of that system was that it charged a single-person household the same as a house in multiple occupation. That was common ground on both sides of the House. The hon. Member for Dagenham should be honest enough to say, "Okay, we may have changed our minds," but that was the official position of the Labour party until two or three years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is again applying far too crude a criterion. I shall describe the common ground as clearly as I can and say why it is so surprising that the Government have gone beyond it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common ground rests on the paradigm of the widowed pensioner who wants to continue to live in the family house although it is too big and expensive for her to maintain on her retirement pension. Everyone accepts that that is the classic example of the person who was unfairly treated under the rates system. That is why we have gone to some lengths in our amendments to meet that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Nottingham, South wants to point to past statements in which we identify exactly that case, he is quite right to do so. However, we cannot understand why that case should be extended across the board to all single people, without an adequate explanation of what underlies that extension. Why will simply living by oneself, in a property in any category, attract a smaller bill or earn a personal discount? The only reason can be to demonstrate to erstwhile supporters of the poll tax— incidentally, I notice that even the hon. Member for Tayside, North has not stayed to listen to the argument—that an element of head tax still applies. That is why that stupid and rather fateful step has been taken. Instead of attaching a directed solution to a real problem, as we aim to do, the Government have got themselves hopelessly confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still do not understand the difference. Why, under the hon. Gentleman's proposals for a single premium, does he exclude widows who are below pensionable age? That is the difference between the two points of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The category of single pensioners is easily identifiable. They may feel that in the past they have been prejudiced by the rating system. If the concern is about personal discounts or specific help, it therefore makes sense to concentrate such help on that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through our amendment we do not propose anything as ramshackle, stupid or as comprehensive as the discount scheme. The only reason for a discount as opposed to a rebate scheme is to maintain the fiction—a partial fiction—that there is an element of head tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the practical questions that the Under-Secretary was asked. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) and others asked him how the system would work. Would the local authority simply issue a range of bills to all households and then wait for applications? The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
Gentleman's reply to some of the questions lacked specificity. He was obliged to turn to schedule 2, which relates to permissive powers to make regulations in certain directions, and to extrapolate from that how he thought that the power would be exercised, his answer lacked conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not seen the regulations, and I doubt whether the Under-Secretary has done so either. In approaching this extremely difficult and complicated business—everyone agrees that the administrative complexities are horrendous—local government may well read in 	<i>Hansard</i> what the Under-Secretary said, but local authorities will get precious little comfort from that. They know that what the Under-Secretary says in the Committee, whether it turns out to be right or wrong—who knows?—is not a basis on which they can rely. They must wait for the regulations. If the Under-Secretary will say that the regulations will have the effect that he just described, that might be helpful. Will he tell us that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations will implement in detail what I said. The answer to the hon Gentleman's point is that the sooner the Bill is enacted, the sooner we shall have the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice a certain lack of precision in that reply. The Under-Secretary simply waffled briefly to escape from that difficult question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have not yet elicited from Ministers a proper explanation of the principle that underlies this ill-thought-out proposal, and as we have not had proper answers to our practical questions, we wish to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case for the amendment can be stated simply because we have already debated many of the matters that underlie it. We object in principle to the discount system. It is unsatisfactory because, as I said earlier, it is not linked to any comprehensible principle of fairness, such as income, ability to pay or demand for services. It is therefore a most unsatisfactory principle on which to proceed. As we showed in the Division on the previous amendment, we should rather not have a discount system at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right way forward is to concentrate whatever help is available—I shall say in a moment why our proposals would give more help than the Government's proposals—on the single criterion of ability to pay, which can be identified in various ways. We care about the ability to pay, and are not satisfied with a wishy-washy, woolly principle which cannot be enunciated or articulated and which supposedly underlies the discount system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should be attempting to help those people who, on the ordinary principles of the tax, would not be able to pay their bill because they lacked the money to do so. That is the purpose of our amendments. We believe that by operating through the rebate system, we can direct the money to where it is needed. We have made that clear in our fair rates proposal, which is a focused attempt to help people, as opposed to the Government's unfocused and woolly proposed discounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some of the amendments we have identified by some easily determined and identifiable criteria, those who may need help. We have done so by linking them to the receipt of specific benefits that are generally received on income grounds. That targets resources to the right quarters and provides a simple criterion for identifying those who are eligible for help. We do not need the canvassing, snooping and aerial photography that Conservative Members seem to think is necessary under their system. We could establish simply whether people are entitled to benefits or not. If they are so entitled, they would receive the benefits of our rebate scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the attention of Conservative Members to amendment No. 128, which I believe entirely covers the case which the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) advanced. I hope that he will consider it and support it. We look forward to his support because I am sure that he is genuine in his anxiety about the people whom he so movingly described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our fair rates proposal, we shall be able to produce a more effective rebate scheme. We shall be
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
able to help more people because money will be saved from present expenditure on rebates. Conservative Members may wonder how that magic is to be performed. If we succeed, as we clearly will, in introducing a fair rates system that produces lower bills, the same level of rebates as at present under the poll tax will cost less. There will be money left over. The Government discovered that when they pretended to knock £140 off poll tax bills. It was unfortunate that most of those who could do with help did not receive such a large advantage. Nevertheless, when that £140 was knocked off some people's bills, the Government discovered that money was saved on rebates. They pocketed the money, but we would not do that. We would reapply it to an extended and more effective rebate scheme. By using the same sum of money so that no extra expenditure would be involved, we could provide extra benefits and rebates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any reasonable person would see that we have a clear, rational and targeted proposal for helping those who need help that would be preferable to the confusion, both in principle and in practice, that we heard about during the previous debate and which surrounds the discount scheme. For predictable reasons, Ministers will not accept our case, but I hope that some Conservative Members—I have high hopes of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South—will see the sense of our argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments No. 80 and 84 refer to carers. The Minister said that some carers are exempt from poll tax and that the Government will consider how, the definition of carers should be extended in the light of the opinion of those concerned. He also said that when they had digested that information they would respond, but that they would not require an amendment to the Bill to do so. However, I wish to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that RADAR and Mencap. Those organisations believe that disabled people who pay for a live-in carer should be classed as a single-person household if that is what they would have been otherwise. Additional costs should not be imposed on a household that, by necessity rather than choice, is occupied by two people rather than one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have recognised the need for disabled people to be able to live independently. However, such independence is often possible only if there is a live-in carer. The independent living fund that the Government set up in 1988 has made that possible for some severely disabled people. The awards are based on an assessment of care needs and enable disabled people to employ the regular help that they need to stay in their own homes or to move out of institutional care into homes of their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is rehearsing arguments that Labour Members have advanced in previous debates, and there is a common approach on the Opposition side of the Committee to such matters. The Liberal party, however, chose to oppose Labour Members when we raised this matter in the debate on the previous set of amendments. Opposition Members, together with the groups involved in the campaign, should try to target
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
Ministers and secure from them clear and specific promises, which they have not given so far. They squirmed in the previous debate in their attempt to avoid giving any commitment. The hon. Lady is repeating what Labour Members said in the previous debate. We were unable to secure assurances yet she still voted against us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hope to make common cause in this matter, and hope also that the Government will take our views on board. As an example of what we are talking about, I shall cite the case of a woman in her 60s who is severely disabled with multiple sclerosis. Her husband died 18 months ago, which meant that she had to move in with her son's family. Conditions were very cramped and entirely unsuitable for anyone with severe disabilities. Fortunately, this lady was granted an independent living fund award, which enabled her to pay for the care that she needed to live in her own home. Thus she was able to return home and avoid the only other option, which was of going into residential care. That is a very worthwhile outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen to encourage people to lead independent lives. That must be right, as it gets people out of residential care and into the community. However, the council tax proposals as they stand do the very opposite, and mean that what the Government give with one hand they appear to take away with the other. I am sure that all hon. Members realise that carers are not a luxury for the disabled people who need them. They are a necessity, and make the difference between a full and active life and a life that offers only dependency and little choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In previous debates we have attempted to show the Bill's unfairness in making no provision for the ability to pay. The Bill does not provide the cover that the Government claim for people on low incomes. Indeed, the proposals will assist those with resources rather than those without. If discounts do not relate to a person's ability to pay, they will give the highest level of public subsidy to the better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. A person living in a £30,000 house in Wales, perhaps one in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), will have to pay about £109 if he is single and qualifies for a 25 per cent discount of £27.25, or the princely sum of 52p a week, whereas a single person living in a house worth £330,000, perhaps in the constituency of the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis), will be liable for council tax of £800 and will qualify for a discount of £200, or £3.85 a week. So the more wealthy a person is and capable of meeting his obligations, the greater the discount. The Bill is regressive in terms of people with low incomes. It is a complete mirror image of the poll tax legislation under which those with little or no income subsidised to a great extent those who were better off. But now the situation is even worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
Ministers have been coy about their views on the implementation of discounts for those with low incomes. The Government said that the principle had already been set down for the scheme and the exemptions but that they had to work out the details. During an exchange that I had with the Under-Secretary of State for Wales on social security the Minister referred me to the Department of Social Security because he was unable, or unwilling, to comment on how the Bill's proposals will affect those on benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's coyness is a smokescreen to hide their real intentions in regard to the regulations, just as they did with housing benefit and the poll tax. The meat of the legislation will appear in the regulations, which Parliament cannot scrutinise properly. The regulations will depress further the ability of low-income groups to gain justice under the Bill's proposals and exacerbate the way in which those with middle and high incomes who are able to make a contribution will obtain the largest slice of public subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities, who was not prepared the other day to give the Committee information about the operationof such schemes, was prepared to give an interview to a journalist from 	<i>Public Finance and Accountancy,</i> which was published on 22 November. The Minister was prepared to go further with a journalist in discussing the Government's attitued to discounts and the way in which the regulations will operate than he was with the Committee. Indeed, less than half an hour ago, the Minister was not prepared to give us details. He said that it was a matter of general principle and that all would be revealed in the regulations. In the interview the Minister went a long way towards implying that the Government would use the regulations to undermine further the position of people with low incomes and their ability to claim assistance for the 25 per cent and the 100 per cent reductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from the article, and perhaps the Minister will interrupt to correct any inaccuracies. The article is entitled "U-turn on benefits 'threatens poor'." It begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Government U-turn on the shape of council tax benefits could create new poverty traps in the system that will hit pensioners and others on low incomes … Michael Portillo, the Local Government Minister, this week gave the clearest indication yet that the Government was to ditch its initial, and highly convoluted proposals for benefits under the new system.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>He said that the Government was now proposing something 'very much simpler'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The original proposals included among other things, a graduated benefit worth a maximum of 25 per cent of gross bills, which council tax payers could claim in respect of second adults and low incomes in the household.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This will now almost certainly be dropped and may now be replaced by a flat-rate 25 per cent reduction for those households where the second adult is on income support.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And there are likely to be cuts in benefit payments where income is earned by other people in the household who are not supported by the council tax payer—so-called non-dependent deductions."</p></blockquote>
Here is the interesting part:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Portillo told 	<i>PFA</i> this week 'Rebates and benefits may be the most complicated part of the system, but I don't think they'll be overly complex, and I don't think they'll look very complicated by comparison with the rates.'</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>The liable person would be entitled to rebates of 100 per cent if he or she was on income support, or had earnings at that level…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'You then need to take into account what happens if there is… a person living there who could contribute to the bill'."</p></blockquote>
The Minister implies in the article what he was not prepared to tell the Committee, which is that if someone is entitled to 100 per cent rebate, that person has overcome only the first hurdle. If someone who could make a contribution lives in the same property, the first person risks losing the rebate. That is controversial, and a fundamental change in position. We understood that the 100 per cent rebate pertained to those on benefit levels or below. But those people will have to overcome a second hurdle under the council tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that if the Minister takes that line, claimants will be asked to complete forms and state the income of other people who live in the same property? Judgments will be made on the information in the form without checking it with the individuals concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. In the article the Minister comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will get to the position where the claimant alone can fill out a form and declare the income of other people in the household."</p></blockquote>
How does the Minister propose to implement that in a home of multi-occupation, or for a couple? The proposal is an intrusion into individual liberties. People who apply for a rebate will become the eyes and ears of the Government or the council tax officer. The benefit, to which people are entitled because of low income, will be dependent on the information given in the form. The Government should make a detailed statement to the Committee about the position that the Minister outlined in the article.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must explain the comments that he made to 	<i>Public Finance and Accountancy.</i> The proposal to take another person's income into account has been carried over from the poll tax. Under the poll tax system, the income of the person who lives with the applicant as man or wife is taken into account. The article implies that the income of any other person who lives in the household will be taken into account. That could include not only a relative, a spouse or a common law husband or wife, but a joint tenant. That is worse than the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It implies that the Government are prepared to use regulations cynically to place people on low incomes in a difficult if not impossible financial position. They are not, however, prepared to state that in the Bill. There would be public outcry if the Government admitted that they would try to use people in this way. That is why I believe that when the Department of Social Security regulations come out the position will be considerably worse than my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench described it when moving the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If discussions took place, either a statement was made to the magazine or it was not. If it was made,
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
and it was accurate, the Minister owes it to the Committee to give us a detailed statement about the discussions on the drafting of the regulations as they relate to the schedule. It is unacceptable for the Minister to give a journalist detailed statements about the principle and detail behind and in the regulations relating to the schedule yet is not prepared to do so in Committee under public scrutiny and on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us a commitment that, if not tonight, he will make a statement at the earliest opportunity about the discussions that are taking place on the draft regulations, and will tell us whether the intention is to prevent people who are entitled to a 100 per cent benefit from receiving it, by taking into account the incomes of others who may live in the household, irrespective of the relationship between the person claiming the benefit and the others in the household. What if a claimant says that he is unwilling or incapable of passing over to the Department of Social Security information about the income of others in the household? Will those persons be ineligible for benefit as set out in the Bill? These are important issues on which the Minister should address the Committee as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak to probing amendment No. 184. In part, my remarks will follow on from those of my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). We need to explore what has happened since the publication of the consultation paper. "A New Tax for Local Government". In paragraph 3.6 it proposed that there should be a special discount where the occupier is not eligible for a rebate but shares the home with a second adult who is on benefit or is in receipt of some sort of low-income award. That has now disappeared. The article in 	<i>Public Finance and Accountancy</i> referred to that change of heart. We all sympathise with the Government's dilemma in terms of the administrative complexities of dealing with a discount system, a rebate scheme and a property tax rolled into one. There are three parts to it: an income-related part, a personal head count part and a property household part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the difficulty arises, as we shall see later this evening when we debate amendment No. 72, where a rebate system is used on its own, particularly because since 1982-83 it has been adjusted in a way that has disadvantaged those who were previously eligible, who were trying to try to cope with a situation with which we all sympathise. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) unfortunately votes against generalities but is in favour of individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all had the experience of knowing, hearing of or reading about a deserving person whom we want to help when we do not want to vote for something that would resolve the general problem rather than a specific one. We all know of specific cases. A widow could have an occupational pension scheme from her husband's work that leaves her
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
fractionally above the rebate scheme. She would probably be, unenviably, disfranchised from entitlements to rebate but within the income tax threshold—my mother was in that position after my father's death. That widow could have someone living with her—before I obtained employment, I could have been in that situation—who draws on family income but is not entitled under the proposals to some discount or help. Such a person would have been so entitled under the original proposals. That is an unfortunate position. The Government, at first, wanted to assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation may arise with a mentally handicapped person. The mum may not work but have enough income to disqualify her from rebate, and the mentally handicapped person could attend a day centre. If he or she set up a separate household and the mum had to visit each day to help, that person would be entitled to a single person discount and may be entitled to an additional, but highly complicated, rebate. Both people would then be living separately, but the widow would be entitled to the discount, and the son or daughter to a discount and a rebate. We would not want to encourage that. We should have preferred the two to live together to provide each other with mutual support and aggregate the household income in a sensible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A property tax would be a sensible way to deal with such a case, because it would encourage people to maximise the use of a property in the best way rather than to seek two separate households. In the latter case, one or both of those people would have to seek a one-bedroomed flat or bungalow from the local authority instead of sharing a small semidetached house or house that they have occupied for a long time. To stay in such accommodation would help the local authority—it would not have to seek additional accommodation—and the people involved, by helping them in their fellowship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all sympathise with that. However, for some reason, what the Government originally thought a good idea has disappeared from the Bill. The rebate system should accommodate that idea, not only by adjustments, which I hope to discuss later if we have time, but through the recognition of people's interdependence. Why has the original scheme slipped through our fingers? Are the Government thinking of not carrying through the original scheme, but adjusting the rebate system so that it may help in cases of the sort that I have described? That illustrates the complexity of dealing with a range of issues that relate personal circumstances and property to discount and rebate within the same Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because of that accusation this morning, which all hon.

I am perfectly happy to state my position, which arises not from cowardice or hypocrisy, but from an examination of amendments Nos. 127 and 184.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have served on many Standing Committees and I should like to award clause 11 the gold medal for obtuse legal language. I think that it says that a household with a single chargeable adult has a 25 per cent discount and that there is a 50 per cent discount for a household with no resident chargeable adult. I hope that that is what the clause says, but, heavens above, I wish that we would use language that everybody could understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little worried because I was not aware that there had been a major change regarding financial matters on the Opposition Benches. The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs Beckett) usually speaks on financial matters for the Opposition. However, the amendments seem to propose a disregard of £15,999 for a single occupier and a total disregard for a couple with assets or cash in the bank of £31,998. If the Opposition are proposing to abolish all estimates of income from sums of £32,000 for a couple, that is a new commitment. Perhaps Opposition Members can clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point of the spat this morning was that I was trying to defend retired single pensioners. The amendments would mean that a retired couple may have savings of £2 less than £32,000, but if they were retired and drawing their pensions, they would be disregarded for tax under the clause. As hon. Members will remember, the House rightly abolished the earnings rule last October, so I can envisage circumstances in which one or both pensioners in a couple may work beyond retirement age and, quite legitimately, be in receipt of retirement pension and also have savings in the bank of £2 less than the £32,000. If any of my constituents fell into that category, I doubt that they would object to making a contribution—I stress a contribution—to the tax that the Government propose. I am sure that on reflection, the Opposition will realise that amendments Nos. 127 and 184 are frayed around the edges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify a point so that there is no misunderstanding. There is a substantial difference between capital and income, but, unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman confused them when presenting his case. He referred to capital savings of £16,000, which is not the same as income. We did not pursue amendment No. 184; I explained that it was a probing amendment and then spoke to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must check the record, but I think that I was talking about people who have

	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
savings and so derive an income from £1 short of £16,000 for a single person or £2 short of £32,000 for a couple. May I say in passing that I question, given current interest rates, the present presumed £1 for every £2.50? I feel that that is wrong and I hope that Treasury Ministers will look at it again. However, in the context of the amendment, my arguments have not yet been challenged.

The other item on the list is housing benefit. Again, I do not know what the future holds for scales of allowances for people paying ever-increasing rents, or whether there will ever be a regional approach to housing benefit. The reality is that it would be foolish to lock ourselves into a situation that would require major amendments to the primary legislation because we had said that, regardless of future circumstances, anyone receiving any housing benefit—that is how the clauses are worded—would automatically receive a 100 per cent rebate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When we debated the Housing Act 1988 in this very Committee Room, the Government proposed that when landlords put up the rent for private tenants, the Government would meet that increase for people who deserved housing benefit, regardless of the amount by which the rent was increased.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great danger in putting a list of exceptions into primary legislation. It is almost certain that
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
within months of a Bill receiving Royal Assent, the Government of the day—whoever they are—will wish to create another benefit to respond to another problem. We shall then be faced with the ludicrous situation that such a benefit cannot be written into the primary legislation. So I do not like lists. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Leeds, West may laugh, but I hope that he never has to swallow his own tongue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last item relates to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a training allowance payable under the Youth Training Scheme, the Employment Training Scheme or any similar scheme".</p></blockquote>
To use that sort of phraseology in primary legislation is asking for trouble and will lead to arguments. When a future Government create a scheme, there will be arguments about whether it is similar to the ones referred to in amended clause 11. Incidentally, I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is back. So it is not on the ground of cowardice or hypocrisy that I shall vote against the amendment. I believe that I have made a reasonable case for the position that I intend to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That astonishing speech started from a mistaken premise. The hon. Gentleman said—he will correct me if I am wrong—that he would not give a 100 per cent rebate to all those included in amendment No. 127. The implication of the whole of the hon. Gentleman's speech was that we propose a 100 per cent rebate for those people. If he put that amendment in the context of the clause, he would see that those people would receive a 25 per cent discount. It says nothing more than that. Of course, such people may qualify for 100 per cent rebates for other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he objected to an automatic 25 per cent discount for someone who was on housing benefit, but he is quite prepared for his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales to receive a 25 per cent discount on his income because he happens to be a single person. He is happy for my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) to receive a 25 per cent discount. However, he does not want a couple on housing benefit or on retirement pension with savings automatically to receive that discount. He made that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again when the poll tax was under discussion we heard the argument about a person living alone next door to a family. I once compared a widow living alone in a big house in Newlands—a wealthy area of my constituency—with a family of five in the house next door. I do not know whether all members of that family worked, but they were all on the electoral register, and I accept that they probably did. The change from rates to poll tax gave the widow a massive saving—about £1,500. However, the total amount of poll tax paid by the other five people was not as great as the amount that they had paid in rates. The widow benefited at the expense, not of the family next door, but of widows living in Castlemilk, who are now being asked to pay 20 per cent of the poll tax. They had to pay for the saving made by that widow, who was extremely wealthy. I shall not name her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I also remember a widow who was a senior member of the Liberal party telling me that I should not complain that the Tory party overused the argument about widows and single householders. She said, "You really should not make that argument. After all, I am a widow and live alone." I replied that I had read in the local paper about the £1 million that her husband had just left her. The idea that all single people should receive the 25 per cent discount is absurd. Our amendment would target the discount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reiterate what my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham said; we do not want a discount system. We made that clear in the first group of amendments. We lost that debate in the first vote. We are now entitled to say that, if there is to be a discount, let us at least target it at those who are in need, not give it to everyone willy nilly whatever their income. I should have thought that Conservative Members would consider that.

If we look back over the social security and housing benefit legislation of the past 12 years, we see that the Government's argument time and again has been that they want to target benefits. They have slashed the subsidy to council tenants and transferred it to housing benefit, saying that that targets those in need. The Government's opposition to the amendment makes their message clear: targeting is all right when it means that benefit will be taken from the poor, but not when it might take some money away from the rich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) was speaking, the Under-Secretary said, "But we already do that with housing benefit." That is absolutely true. The housing benefit regulations that took account of all the incomes of a household have had a disastrous effect on poor families in the poorest part of my constituency. Those regulations came from the party that calls itself the party of the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will have a similar impact to that of the housing benefit regulations. It will drive young people over 18 out of family homes into poor accommodation. That will benefit their parents, as the income of the young people would otherwise be included in benefit calculations. Those young people should be receiving the support of their parents. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I heard the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales mutter "Utter rubbish". In a recent debate, the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) said that that phrase showed a certain paucity of language. This is not utter rubbish. The Under-Secretary should come to my constituency to see the impact of housing benefit regulations. I should be happy to show him exactly what the regulations have done—youngsters have been forced out of their family homes. If what the Minister is quoted as saying in the article to which my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield referred is correct, a similar thing will happen under the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Government changed the housing benefit rules for private tenants under the Housing Act 1988, they insisted that local authority tenants should pay the difference. In effect, local authorities were capped on the benefit payments to tenants with private landlords unless that money was collected from local authority tenants—in other words, poor people on housing benefit paid the housing benefits of others who were equally poor but who were housed in the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Under-Secretary was silly to mutter those words under his breath
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appear to be suggesting that a middle class widow in employment will receive the 25 per cent discount. She may be a doctor or a head teacher and thus quite well off, but because her three children are all students and live in her house she will receive the 25 per cent discount. On the other hand, there is the example of a widow who is scraping a living and receiving a rebate, although not the full 100 per cent and who has three unemployed sons in the household. Not only will they not be disregarded but their income from benefit may lose her whatever rebate she receives. If that is the case, the Under-Secretary had better explain because it is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a powerful case, but there is a further injustice. If the Government insist on targeting limited resources towards causes that do not deserve that help, not only will there be the injustice of the wealthy widow getting money that she does not need, but the cost of making that unnecessary gesture will fall on the deserving case that my hon. Friend described. That is what I think the logicians call a zero sum game— if there is a winner, there must be a loser as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Gentleman is right. That happened with the poll tax and it will happen with this tax. Time and again, it is the poor who lose and the better off who gain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not an uneven game between the winners and the losers? There will be a massive number of losers compared with gainers. Every loser is someone who cannot afford to lose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The article which was kindly given to us must be explained because what is said changes the nature of the tax and the Committee is entitled to an explanation.

I listened to an excellent programme on the radio yesterday called "Good morning Scotland" and heard the Minister explaining other changes to the Bill in amendments to later clauses which we shall debate tonight. Now we read about other changes being made to the Bill. We find out about these changes almost by accident—either by listening to the radio or reading articles. Our proceedings should not be conducted in that way. Ministers should tell us in Committee what they are proposing so that we can debate the changes, and not hear about them secondhand</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) made a crucial point when he quoted the article in 	<i>Public Finance and Accountancy</i> in which the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will get to the position where the claimant alone can fill out a form and declare the income of the other people in the household."</p></blockquote>
The Minister should clarify that statement because his position is untenable. A person who fills in a claim for a rebate would have to fill in a form for everyone else in the household to discover whether he is entitled to that rebate. That would prevent genuine claimants from applying for a rebate and would lead to a large non-take-up of rebates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's point and have some sympathy with it. However, is he suggesting that because under the community charge system, individuals, apart from married couples, can be assessed just on their own income, we should keep the current system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I am saying. We shall deal with that in a later debate. I am saying that it would discourage people who wish to claim benefits to which they are entitled. I think that the Government do not want to pay and they are adding to the stigma. Most people do not see rebates as having any stigma attached to them; it is their right to claim. The Government seem to be adopting a different attitude, so I hope that the Minister will deal with the points raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
