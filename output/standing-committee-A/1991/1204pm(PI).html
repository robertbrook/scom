<p><i>Amendment moved [this day]:</i> No. 290, in page 37, line 38, leave out subsection (5).—<i>[Mr. Murphy.]</i></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 301, in page 37, line 41, leave out subsection (6).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To refresh the Committee's memory, I shall begin by repeating one or two points that I made this morning. Under the Local Government Finance Act 1988, an authority must notify the Secretary of State within seven days of its decisions about the demand on its collection fund. That applies also to substitute decisions. However, the Act provides that an authority, having made its section 95 calculations, can reset them. Any substitute calculations cannot be set at a higher level. There may be circumstances in which an authority may reconsider its section 95 calculation, before the level of the council tax is set, and reduce its budget. The Bill proposes that the Secretary of State would ignore that decision for the purposes of designation and treat the authority as if it had not reset its budget. For example, an authority might reset its budget at a level that the Government would regard as excessive but which would not attract designation due to the de minimis provision.<br><br>
The principle of amendment No. 301 has been discussed several times in the past couple of days. Amendment No. 301 would remove the provision allowing the Secretary of State to include parish or community council spending with district council spending for the purpose of capping. Community charge legislation excludes that possibility. The Bill also excludes parish expenditure, but subsection (6) would allow the Secretary of State, by order, to count parish spending with district spending if he so chooses. Parish or community councils in Wales are independent, legally constituted bodies, able to issue precepts on the billing authority. The billing authority cannot control the level of precept, nor can it influence the parish's spending level.<br><br>
Statistics on the 1991 community charge from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy show several instances in which total parish spending formed a significant proportion of total district expenditure. For example, parish spending in Mid Bedfordshire district council was 19·5 per cent, of district expenditure, and in Huntingdonshire it was 31·3 per cent. The Government must understand that, although the national consequences may be minimal, the local impact
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
may be significant in a few cases. It is illogical to propose capping criteria in such circumstances. If the Government wish to control parish spending, specific criteria should be introduced for parish councils.<br><br>
The objections to this part of the Bill have already been discussed. The Minister said that these clumsy and cumbersome measures had been proposed chiefly because deals would be struck between parish councils and district or borough councils to avoid the Government's expenditure limits. That is claptrap. No deal has ever been struck. In many cases, the parish or community councils and the district councils are at loggerheads about something or other and are unlikely to be able to conclude any such deal.<br><br>
In Wales, parish councils are called community or town councils. They vary in size considerably. In my constituency, the smallest town council covers a population of fewer than 2,000, whereas the largest covers about 40,000. Consequently, the difference in precepts and in what they do is enormous.<br><br>
The Government, only recently, when they published their consultation proposals on the future structure of local government in Wales—and, I suspect, in England—made great play of parish and community councils playing a much larger role in local government in times to come. This spiteful legislation will do nothing to influence the course of such reforms or to increase the confidence of those who work in parish government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the fact that I have not so far spoken in the Committee does not suggest that I have not been taking a close interest in the proceedings, because I have. I am perhaps a little freer than I was yesterday to say a few words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman been sacked?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not so. I am pursuing other responsibilities, which may become clear in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can guess.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister is very perceptive. I should explain, Mr. Leadbitter, that I am relinquishing my present post. It has been my privilege to serve as parliamentary private secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) for the past year. He is a most able and splendid man who has interesting ideas on housing. He has made a great contribution as Minister for Housing and Planning. I am taking up a position as parliamentary private secretary to my right hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment knows, is one of those unusual appointments for which one is neither on the pay roll nor off it. That is an interesting political being.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on his new appointment. I, too, in my parliamentary career have specialised in working for former Prime Ministers. I wish him well. He will never regret it. He should never be put off if he thinks that he is not winning brownie points, because in the long run it will have done nothing but good for him and for my right hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher).</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his remarks. The example that he set and the speed with which he is climbing up the ladder so impressed me that I felt that his was a marvellous precedent to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The congratulatory mood has now expended itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Member would stay in his seat because we should get on with the amendment now. He made a good speech on the Floor of the House yesterday, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate on parish councils. My parish council, Burntwood town council, has an electorate of 19,000. I am well aware of the potential leakage if parish councils are not encompassed within the regime of containment of local government expenditure.<br><br>
Burntwood town council spent £104,000 in 1979, and this year its expenditure will rise to about £600,000, involving a precept of £28·18 for every elector in the parish. That is set against a district charge of £57·39. It is therefore clear that Burntwood town council's precept is about 50 per cent, of the charge made by Lichfield district council. We should bear in mind the difficulties resulting from the free-spending policies of Labour councils during the transition from rates to the community charge. It is important to ensure that there is no back-door method by which socialist councils can shift some of the spending burden on to parish councils to enable them to bump up the council tax. The capping arrangements will apply to district councils whose expenditure is beneath the £15 million spending ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman, who forecast the cost per person in a town council area. However, he did not tell us what services would be provided. To complete the story, he should say what the poll tax payers will receive. Last May, there was a council election in the area about which he is talking after the poll tax had been levied. What was the outcome?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not catalogue the facilities provided by the town council. There was, however, a feud between the Labour-controlled Burntwood town council and the Lichfield district council, which is Conservative controlled. The town council was controlled by Labour between 1979 and 1987. The socialists in Burntwood argued that they did not have facilities which were available in Lichfield. That was true, to a certain extent. The socialists therefore did their own thing and incurred their own expenditure. For the privilege of paying half the charge raised by Lichfield district council, they have a recreation centre and an all-weather pitch, which cost an arm and a leg. Lichfield district council transferred some responsibilities, such as the parks, to Burntwood town council, which wanted more autonomy. As part of that deal, Lichfield district council covers some of the debt-servicing, which is roughly another £60,000 a year. Significant sums are involved.<br><br>
In implementing the community charge, an accusation levied against us by our supporters is that we allowed the Labour party to use the introduction of a new arrangement for funding local authorities as a smokescreen under which they raised their spending in places such as Cannock by 44 per cent. The Labour party then
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 844</span>
blamed the Government and our supporters said that it was all to do with the introduction of the community charge. Free-spending socialist authorities used the new system to bump up their spending and then to blame the Government.<br><br>
I shall tell the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) what happened at the local elections in Cannock in May. There was a 9 per cent, swing to the Conservatives. We increased our representation from three to five, polling 66 per cent., and took one seat that had not been Conservative for 21 years. I take up the point of my hon. Friend the Minister that there was an accountability argument for the community charge. In some places, and especially in Cannock, it was working. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is right to smile; he knows that it was working.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon. Gentleman has new-found freedom on the Committee, he will have noted that clause 100 is entitled, "Abolition of Poll Tax". Given his idealogical zeal for that tax, I assume that he will vote against the clause in the stand part debate.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that the tax is called the community charge, which is a charge for local government services. My hon. Friend the Minister of State made a compelling speech this morning, which I hope will get wider coverage. He explained the strength of our case and emphasised that we are the listening party. The Opposition is the party of restraint, constrictions and sanctions and if it were to come to power, as sure as night follows day, Anthony Crosland's argument that the party is over will apply to local government spending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a refreshing change for the hon. Gentleman to be able to speak rather than simply twitch. As he makes such a favourable reference to the Minister's speech this morning, does he agree with the Minister when he said that he supported the community charge, but also supports the measure to replace it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must observe my voting record; therein will lie much explanation.<br><br>
I promised that I would not detain the Committee, as long as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is fully aware of the risks if we are not careful about the way in which we treat the large parish councils. We shall be blamed by our supporters if we do not heed the lesson of the introduction of the community charge. I hope that my hon. Friend can respond positively to my suggestion that the Bill should include a measure to protect us from parish councils, or other socialist councils, spending wildly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to understand what prompted the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) to table amendment No. 290 which would remove the requirement for the Secretary of State, in considering whether to designate an authority for capping, to exercise his powers in relation to the budget set last. That suggestion is particularly odd. I do not doubt that it is intended to throw a spanner into the capping works, but we should examine its potential effects. The hon. Gentleman's brief from the Council of Welsh Districts, dated 21 November 1991 and beginning,
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Paul,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Briefing—Local Government Finance Bill"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0489">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 845</span>
did not cover that point and so perhaps he has not understood the implications.<br><br>
In the vast majority of cases, an authority will set only one budget for the year and in those cases the amendment would have no effect. An authority will set a substitute budget either because it wants, voluntarily, to reduce the demand on its council tax payers, or because the original budget may have been quashed. In the first case, if a council had set a budget of £100 million, but then had second thoughts and set a new, lower budget of £50 million, the amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from considering the substitute budget in deciding whether to cap the council. The council would be designated for a budget that it no longer planned to raise. It is surely right for the Secretary of State to consider the local authority's existing budget plans rather than an earlier, superceded budget. That is the implication of amendment No. 290, which the hon. Member for Torfaen should withdraw.<br><br>
In the second case, when an authority had set a revised budget as a result of quashing due to an error in the collection or calculation arrangements, the amendment would not allow the Secretary of State to have regard to the revised budget, whether or not it was higher than the original. It is difficult to see what budget the Secretary of State could have regard to in such circumstance. It would surely not be the quashed budget. In any event, council tax payers would be forced to bear the bills associated with the revised budget, without any protection through capping. That is nonsensical.<br><br>
In case Opposition Members think that authorities might increase their budgets voluntarily, I emphasise that they could not do so, even under the scenario suggested in the amendment. Local authorities could not set a budget upon which the capping regime would bite and then set a higher, revised, budget that would allow a greater imposition to be made on their council tax payers resulting in higher bills. As usual, we find at the root of the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Torfaen and his hon. Friends that the long-suffering local tax payer would be exposed to higher charges as a result of unconstrained spending by local authorities. The amendment would not be successful even on its own terms in doing that and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.<br><br>
Several times yesterday we touched on parish and community council precepts. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has already explained why the provision in clause 54(6) is necessary, but I shall repeat the arguments. However, let me say straight away that we cannot accept amendment No. 301.<br><br>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) on his appointment as Parliamentary Private Secretary to my right hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher). I know that he will undertake the job in a first-class manner. My hon. Friend mentioned back-door increases in spending by parish councils as the result of a district council attempting to transfer services to the parish council to escape capping.<br><br>
Clause 54(6) empowers the Secretary of State to disapply the provisions in subsection (4). It is a reserve power which would be used by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State if there were clear evidence that district councils were attempting to evade capping by arranging for community or parish councils to carry out some of their functions. Subsection (4) provides that precepts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 846</span>
issued by parish councils should not normally be taken into account by the Secretary of State in considering whether the budget set by a billing authority was excessive. <br><br>
The Government hope that it will not prove necessary to make an order under subsection (6), but a reserve power is necessary to protect council tax payers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister any evidence of a parish council taking on the responsibilities of a district or borough council to avoid the capping that might follow? If he has no evidence, why are reserve powers necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was a boy scout, but when I was in the scouts the motto was "Be Prepared". That is why we have the reserve power. I hope that local government will be responsible and that we shall not have to use the power. It is only members of the Liberal Democrat party that would not take precautions. They wait until something goes wrong before taking action. It is essential for the Government to have that reserve power in case it is needed.<br><br>
We know the Labour party's stance on capping: the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) explained it in detail last night. When <i>Hansard</i> is available, we shall comb it with delight to find his goldmine of admissions. It will be useful at the forthcoming general election to have from the hon. Gentleman's mouth statements such as that council spending will be allowed to rip if councils so choose and that a Labour Government will not impose controls.<br><br>
The Government are determined that excessive spending by local authorities should not be allowed, not only because it affects public expenditure in terms of the national cake but because we have to protect council tax payers from the problems that would result if local authorities had a free rein without any controls, as the Labour party suggests. We have seen enough of how some Labour-controlled local councils operate to realise that this protection should not be removed in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. My constituents in Burntwood who smart under the impost of £28 per head, which is twice what any other parish or district council has to pay, will be disappointed that the Government will not encompass parish councils in their capping arrangements. But they will be delighted that the Government will not resile from their commitment to ensure that council tax payers will be protected against abuse by some socialist authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend can rest assured that no bolt hole will be allowed for Labour local authorities and they will not be able to milk the tax payer in one way or another. We are right not to follow the Liberal Democrats' example of taking away protections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tell us about the ballot box.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to talk about the ballot box in the next few months. We shall then find out whether his policy of no capping for high-spending authorities is popular.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be by 9 July 1992, so the hon. Government can clear his diary in advance.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen asked whether the Government have in mind any particular figure or criteria
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0490">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 847</span>
for spending by parish, councils which would trigger the use of the power in subsection (6). We do not. The evidence that district councils are abusing the system to avoid capping will trigger the use of that power. Parish councils may be in league with them, but I have no doubt that high-spending district councils would be to blame. I hope that local authorities will bear in mind what is said in Committee, and will not attempt to abuse the system. However, reserve powers in clause 54(6) will be available should that happen.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 290 and 301. Amendment No. 290 would take away the Secretary of State's power to help a local authority which reduced its budget. Amendment No. 301 would not allow the Government a precautionary measure to deal with local authorities that tried to avoid capping rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that amendment No. 290 was inspired by the Council of Welsh Districts. That is not so, although I am sure that the council felt the same way as the association that provided me with some interesting facts. Local government would not be well served if the amendment were withdrawn, because it provides protection for local authorities against this part of the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 301 deals with parish and community councils. The contributions by the Minister and the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) verged on being hysterical. The vast majority of parish councils in England and Wales are small rural authorities. Some spend very little by precept. Some large town councils may spend more, but there is not a shred of evidence that they are in league with district councils. If parish councils decide to spend a lot of money, districts have the problem of trying to stop them doing so to avoid being capped. That is the problem; they are not in cahoots to outwit the Government.<br><br>
There has been a massive over-reaction by the Government on this aspect of local government spending. It started in Committee with the mention of Lambeth and now we are getting to Morton-on-Lugg or somewhere, and rural parts of England. What is said is complete claptrap. I shall not withdraw my amendment, because all practitioners in local government and all officials in the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy maintain that the clause will be unworkable. But I am happy to say, as the Minister has referred to the general election, that none of this will see the light of day.</span></p>
<p>5.pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only one point about the speech of the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). Most members of the Committee will not be aware that in Wales, where we have community rather than parish councils, it is possible for the local electorate to vote the community councils out of existence. The Labour party has spent many months writing to my right hon. Friend and I asking for that democratic power to be removed, because in the past 18 months the electorate in three different community councils in Wales has done that. I do not believe that the Labour party is interested in the local electorate. It wants to take away the basic democratic right which exists for local people to decide whether they wish to have a community council.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 848</span>
Labour Members prattle on about local democracy, but they would like to take away the elementary right of people to decide whether to have a community council in the area, whether it overspends or not. We shall preserve the right of local communities in Wales to decide that for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not square with the position of the Welsh Office which sees an enhanced role for community councils in Wales in the forthcoming reform of local government when unitary authorities are established and community or parish councils have a greater role. I suspect that if the Minister had his way, he would abolish all local councils, not just parish councils.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Wales has been talking about democracy, which is what the amendments are about. If the hon. Gentleman is a true believer in democracy, he will support them.<br><br>
Clause 56 gives the Secretary of State powers to designate authorities which he believes may be spending more than they should. It provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the Secretary of State decides under section 54 above to designate an authority he shall notify it in writing"</p></blockquote>
of his decision. The amendment would require that, in addition the Secretary of State should state his reasons for that decision. If Conservative Members believe in fairness and democracy, they have no reason to oppose the broad principle that the Secretary of State should explain why he believes that a local authority should be designated and brought under the capping procedure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth), who is not in his place at present, said that he was concerned about the level of poll tax levied by a town council in his constituency. But when I asked him what the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0491">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 849</span>
result of the election in May was, he failed to address the question. That suggests that the electorate accepted what the town council had done in providing the facilities to which he referred. If that is what people vote for, why should Members of Parliament object? After all is said and done, we are a democracy and we believe in democracy, yet when it can be seen to be working in communities the Tories do not want to know anything about it. We are asking, by moving the amendments, for a little bit of democracy to be provided for in the Bill.<br><br>
When the sports centre in Cannock was being built, there was no capping of the budgets of district authorities, so the point made in support of the Bill is totally false because capping of district councils was introduced only last year. We are told that the sports centre and the all-weather pitch in that village are up and running, so there was no reason to suggest that it would take over responsibilities of the district council to evade the capping procedures. I make those comments to set the record straight.<br><br>
Another reason for amendment No. 292 is that universal capping has been described as an offence against local democracy. We want to introduce local democracy to offset the effect of any regulations that the Secretary of State may issue under the provisions of the Bill, which mirrors what was in the Local Government Finance Bill of 1988 when capping was introduced and further power given to the Secretary of State. It contains provisions that appeared in the poll tax Bill and proposes the extension of capping procedures.<br><br>
When capping procedures were extended in July 1991, the Government said that they should apply to every council. No reason is given by the Secretary of State to explain why he designates an authority for capping because of the level of its expenditure. I draw attention to a leader that appeared on 14 June 1991 in <i>The Times,</i> which no one would describe as a newspaper that supports Labour. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"an offence against local democracy far more outrageous than anything M Delors is proposing for monetary and political union…It was immediately condemned by the Association of District Councils as shockingly centralist."</p></blockquote>
The chairman at that time was Roy Thomason who, I believe, hopes to come to the House as a Tory Member. I doubt that he will be elected but, if he is, I hope that he will stick to the views that he held as leader of the Association of District Councils. If there is to be a form of local democracy, the Secretary of State must state his reasons for designating an authority.<br><br>
The present Secretary of State for the Environment was Secretary of State when the Tories were elected 12 years ago. We have a recycled Secretary of State who has been through the mill. On 18 July 1979, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will sweep away tiresome and excessive control over local government. Local councils are directly elected. They are answerable to their electorate. They do need, they do not want, the fussy supervision of detail that now exists."</p></blockquote>
Now, the Secretary of State wants to take on new powers and he is saying the opposite of what he said in 1979 and designating authorities without giving them his reasons. The right hon. Gentleman should give an explanation when he uses his power under clause 56.<br><br>
The present Secretary of State wrote to <i>The Times</i> on 10 May 1990, saying that to introduce universal capping would negate accountability and that it would be
<br><blockquote><p>"an act of centralised power outside our experience. On those grounds alone it should be resisted".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 850</span>
The Secretary of State may have moved away from that general principle; he may have done a U-turn; he may even have stood on his head. However, he should at least advise local authorities why he was exercising powers under clause 56.<br><br>
The statutory provisions for charge capping are contained in the Local Government Finance Act 1988. The then Secretary of State referred to charge capping. A working party was established to review the capping procedures, called a new systems working group. At a meeting on 23 March 1989, the group agreed that the Department of the Environment would prepare a paper describing the main statutory provisions for the limitation of charges—charge capping. Those provisions are contained in part VII of the 1988 Act. Part II of the 1988 Act provides for the setting of substitute community charges in response to charge capping. That working group's paper provides a section-by-section summary of some of the main provisions, but it is not intended to be an exhaustive account of the 1988 Act or taken as an aid to interpretation of the statute, nor should it be taken to represent the Secretary of State's view of his statutory powers.<br><br>
Even when the working group was considering the principle of capping, there was no method of deciding what the Secretary of State's view should be on charge capping. That also applies to the capping of the new council tax. The Secretary of State has had those powers for the past two or three years, but at no time has he been required to give his reasons for using those powers. Amendment No. 292 expressed the request that the Secretary of State should give reasons for his decisions. It is only fair and just that he should do so.<br><br>
Recently, Mr. Burton, the city treasurer of Birmingham, said that he would keep a register of the details of the rebates and discounts that would apply under the council tax. The Minister said that there was no legal provision for the treasurer compiling such a list, but he gave no reasons. However, the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation claims that Mr. Burton has statutory powers to compile a register for council tax purposes.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has introduced legislation but has not paused to give his reasons. However, people have told the Government that they are wrong; local authority officials have the right to produce a register, if they wish.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the Committee, will my hon. Friend explain the basis on which Mr. Burton will be able to compile a register? What legislation did the institute have in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That question should be answered. The Secretary of State should explain his reasons to local authorities. The legislation that my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) referred to—under which Mr. Burton claims he has the right to compile a register—is the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976. That Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where, with a view to performing a function conferred on a local authority by any enactment".</p></blockquote>
It does not specify an enactment. Therefore, the Act will come into play when the Bill becomes law. Mr. Burton has every right to compile a register under the 1976 Act.<br><br>
The Minister of State is on record as saying that Mr. Burton has no statutory power to compile a register. The

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 851</span>
Minister has been challenged on that point by the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation. Both cannot be right. The case highlights the stupidity and futility of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend so far, but what is the position in Scotland? The legislation that he mentioned relates only to England and Wales. I am not a Member of Parliament for a Scottish constituency, but is there appropriate legislation covering Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying hard to follow the extent to which the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 is connected with the amendment. As I understand it, the hon. Member is referring to the conflict between the present legislation, the responsibilities of a local authority officer and the interpretation of the 1976 Act as providing authority to compile a list. What has the list to do with the amendment? I am sure that the hon. Member has the answer, but I do not know what it is at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to amendment No. 292 which would oblige the Secretary of State to give his reasons when designating an authority. The Minister has made statements about the legislation without giving any reason and he has been challenged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, and the hon. Gentleman made a valid point precisely and pertinently. However, I do not understand the relevance of the list and the local authority officer. Those matters must have been connected with the amendment, or the hon. Gentleman would not have raised them. Perhaps he will enlighten me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly shall, Mr. Leadbitter. If Mr. Burton, the city treasurer of Birmingham, wants to keep the list, people will be employed to maintain it and resources will be needed. If the Secretary of State thinks that Birmingham is spending more than it should, he can put Birmingham on the list of designated authorities until it stops providing that register, if that is one of the reasons for its overspending.<br><br>
My argument is that the local authority is not acting outside the law, and that the Department of the Environment has no statutory basis for claiming that the authority is doing so. Under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 Mr. Burton has statutory protection, but will the designated authority procedure in the Bill stop him from maintaining the register? Will the Minister explain how such a situation will be dealt with? When the Secretary of State makes a decision, he should give reasons for it. If the register is one of the reasons why Birmingham is to be a designated authority, he should say so. The matter should not be decided under the cloak of the Bill. Under the Local Government Finance Act 1988—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked my hon. Friend about the position with regard to Scotland, so that when our hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) returns, we can explain to him what we have been discussing in his absence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a worthy question. The Bill covers England, Scotland and Wales. The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 applies only to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 852</span>
England and Wales. If there is to be the same protection for Scotland as for England and Wales under the Bill, the Act must be amended. There is a mismatch between various legislation affecting local government. Over the past few days we have exposed the weaknesses in the legislation, and this is a further example to show how an ill-thought out Bill will disadvantage local government.<br><br>
Under the Local Government Finance Act 1988, if an authority is designated for capping, it is given 28 days to inform the Secretary of State in writing of the reasons why it believes that the cap should be at a different level from that suggested by him. Let us suppose that a local authority produces a budget which the Secretary of State considers too high. He writes to tell the authority that designation procedures are to begin, but he does not state the reason. However, he expects the local authority to respond within 28 days, giving reasons why it considers that the rate should be set at a level that is different from the level that he has set.<br><br>
The Act specifically requires the authority to provide reasons for the rate that it has set, but no similar duty is placed on the Secretary of State when he issues the notice. That is a plain example of the difference between the functions of the local authority and the function of the Secretary of State when deciding the future of local government. The demands of the Secretary of State and those of the local authority should be similar.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Secretary of State could be misinformed. A decision that he made which goes against a local authority could have been based on wrong information. If the local authority is not provided with reasons why the Secretary of State reached his decision to designate, it will not have the opportunity to correct any erroneous information with which he may have been provided. There are heaps of reasons why the amendment should be accepted.<br><br>
Amendment Nos. 291 and 256 approach the issue in two different ways. If either of the proposals is accepted, we shall be prepared to withdraw amendment No. 278. Amendment No. 291 would include in the clause a subsection (d) that would provide for
<br><blockquote><p>"a summary of the reductions in services provided by the authority that he considers likely to result from the amount which he proposes as a maximum for the year."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we propose that the Secretary of State should say what services would be reduced by the local authority if clause 56 was applied to it.<br><br>
Under amendment No. 256, the Secretary of State would have to state what services will need to be reduced,
<br><blockquote><p>"as a result of the powers exercised under the section."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain what action the Secretary of State will take when designating an authority? If the right hon. Gentleman considers, for example, that the register should be discontinued as it was one of the services affected by the provisions, he should say so. If he considers that the local authority must reduce its services as a result of the level of expenditure that he has set, he must inform the authority which services should be reduced, such as the provision of home helps, nurseries, planning and highway services.<br><br>
As the Secretary of State will be given statutory responsibilities under the clause, he should provide authorities with information about the likely outcome of their being capped. If not, it will be too easy for the right hon. Gentleman to say that a certain authority should be capped.—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) is finding it increasingly difficult to get his words across to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Leadbitter. If the Secretary of State decides that an authority should be capped, the amendment would place on him a duty to explain the effects of the capping on the services provided by that authority. In Queen <i>v.</i> Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte Hammersmith and Fulham, the High Court was told that the Secretary of State believed that the proposed reductions would be achieved without disrupting service delivery or causing financial difficulties. In an affidavit sworn by Mr. P. Rowsell on behalf of the Secretary of State, it was said that
<br><blockquote><p>"he decided to approach the setting of proposed maximum amounts on the basis of judging from all the information available to him whether the full reduction would be achievable in the year in question without disrupting service delivery or causing financial difficulties."</p></blockquote>
The court asked for an explanation of how the Secretary of State would apply the decision made against Hammersmith and Fulham. The Bill should require the Secretary of State to give information about the reason for using the powers in the way described in the clause.<br><br>
We have sufficient evidence and experience of universal capping. The amendments would make the rate-capping powers that the Secretary of State may use against local authorities more democratic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although it is my aim to co-operate as much as possible with the hon. Gentleman, I fear that on this matter there is a fairly large chasm between us. I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) will withdraw the amendment. Should he not do so, I will advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.<br><br>
The Labour party wants to have its cake and eat it. It wants local democracy with local authorities taking all the decisions, but it also expects the taxpayer to hand over money via the Government without local accountability or regard to value for money, and it wants the Secretary of State to intervene and tell the local authority how to spend the money. Those propositions are incompatible.<br><br>
Our aim remains to protect local tax payers from the consequences of excessive spending by any authority and to ensure that all authorities budget sensibly and play their part in securing the wider economic goals that we seek to achieve. No authority can be exempt from the need for expenditure restraint and providing greater value for money.<br><br>
The two arguments for the extensive capping powers that we want to continue under the council tax are interconnected. First, we are determined to ensure that the substantial extra level of central funding of local authority spending continues to be used to keep local taxes at reasonable levels and not to boost spending. Secondly, we are equally determined to prevent the wholly unjustified spending that accompanied the introduction of the community charge from taking place during the transition to the council tax.<br><br>
These theories are not untested. The evidence in their support is clear. We need only compare the experience of this year with that of 1990–91. This year, unlike the previous year, we announced in advance the provisional capping criteria that applied to all authorities with budgets
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 854</span>
over £15 million. The results speak for themselves. This year budgets were within about ½per cent, of the amount provided for in the settlement.<br><br>
The Opposition say, "No capping and no restraints." The evidence which we have faced and responsibly acted upon shows clearly what would happen were the Opposition ever to be in a position to put their plans in place. There would be an extravaganza. Uncontrolled local authority spending would go through the roof.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton spoke about the Government's decision to bring the so-called £15 million authorities into the capping regime. But that decision is not confined to one or two authorities. In 1991, more than 40 authorities spending below £15 million put £20 or more on their charges because of overspending. The need to bring such authorities into the capping regime is clear when one sees the extra burdens that some have placed on their charge payers. For example, Derwentside has imposed an extra burden of £95, while the extra burdens imposed by Elmbridge and Harlow were £73 and £83, respectively.<br><br>
First, it should be obvious to one and all why an authority has been designated—quite simply, it has set a budget which the Secretary of State considers to be excessive or to represent an excessive increase over that set for the previous year. Indeed, in the notice of designation, we shall notify any designated authority of these principles in accordance with clause 56(1)(b).<br><br>
If the Opposition are concerned, as I suspect that they are, with the reasons which led the Secretary of State to propose a certain amount as the cap for that authority, the answer is equally straightforward. The Secretary of State takes into account all of the circumstances of the authority in deciding the level of cap.<br><br>
It is nonsense to suggest that the Secretary of State should provide a summary of the service reductions which he considers are likely to result from a lower budget in line with his proposed or final cap. It is not for the Secretary of State to give a designated authority his view about the manner in which it should meet its cap any more than it is for him to provide a summary of his reasons for the proposed cap.<br><br>
It is for the authority to decide whether or not it wishes to challenge the proposed cap on the basis of its own information, and to form its own judgment. Similarly, it is for the authority to decide how to live within its revised lower budget whether it has accepted the proposed cap or not. It is certainly not for Ministers to become involved in the detail of local authority priorities or budgeting decisions. Those are matters for local decision, as I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton will agree.<br><br>
Secondly, and more fundamentally, I reject the suggestion that service reductions are the inevitable consequence of capping. It seems that however many times that we repeat it, the point eludes Opposition Members. It is quite possible for costs to be reduced by improving efficiency, streamlining the administration of services and cutting out waste. We have heard endless stories about the cuts that will result from capping. Time and again these have not been borne out by events.<br><br>
In a debate on the Floor of the House on 23 January, my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) noted that in September 1990 the National Association of Local Government Officers had conducted a survey of the capped authorities. My hon. Friend said that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0494">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 855</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"newspaper <i>Public Service</i> reported that Basildon had said that no redundancies were anticipated; Brent had said that no cuts were required as a result of capping; Bristol had said that there would be no redundancies, no cuts in services and no charge increases; Calderdale had said that it was holding growth, increasing some charges and cutting some non-essential services; and Camden had said that no cuts were necessary. The cap was £4·4 million, but Camden council said:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'Our income is sufficient for us not to need to make cuts.' Greenwich said that some redundancies were expected, but that there would be no large-scale job cuts, and Lambeth said that it had managed to avoid closure of front-line services and that there would be no redundancies."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 23 January 1991; Vol. 184, c. 339.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has insisted on denouncing central Government control, but at the start of the Committee's proceedings he said that the Labour party believed that each authority should be able
<br><blockquote><p>"to say to its electorate that it proposes to provide services at the following level and to levy local taxes to finance those services."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 19 November 1991; column 9.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to get excited about every absurd and outrageous statement from the Under-Secretary. However, the survey of the National Association of Local Government did not suggest that Officers did not suggest that authorities had not made cuts. It may have suggested that compulsory redundancies had not taken place, but that is not the same as cuts in services, which have been deep and damaging. Let me give an example, which I challenge the Under-Secretary to refute. In Sheffield, £20 million has been taken from the education service over the past three years and in the authority as a whole, 1,300 people have been made redundant. We are all well aware that the same has been happening in authorities throughout the country. Some of us know—even if Ministers do not—why compulsory and voluntary redundancies were made in Liverpool because we examined its budget. A complete myth is being peddled by those who wish to close their eyes to reality and avoid the consequences of their decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a complete myth that Keva Coombes said that in Liverpool, which the hon. Gentleman has just cited, it cost four times as much to pick up the rubbish as elsewhere. His argument about cuts in services is partial; there have been increases in services elsewhere. Cuts that have been made in schools, social services and old people's homes, for example, may have been the result of a reduction in the demand for those services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to disagree with my hon. Friend, but the position is slightly different in Liverpool where it costs four times as much not to clean up the rubbish. That makes the point clearly that cuts in the amount spent on services in Liverpool resulted in rubbish being collected when it had not previously been collected: £16 million was spent on the direct labour force when no, or little, rubbish was collected and £4 million was spent when the job was put out to tender and a private contractor took over. For the first time in five years, the streets of Liverpool are clean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a telling point, which many of us have experienced first-hand when we visited Liverpool and other cities. Some Opposition Members spend too much time criticising the Government and making much noise about such issues instead of talking to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 856</span>
the local authorities. If they did so, they would realise how extraordinarily upset the dedicated officers and staff of those authorities become when they hear from the Labour party nothing but carping and criticism and cries that reject calls for efficiency and improved services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is playing a typical Tory trick. He mentions Liverpool and, in a throwaway remark adds, "and other cities". He has a responsibility to identify those cities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No problem at all. Housing stock management could be improved in Manchester, where there are over 6,000 empty housing units. I could give examples in Lambeth, in Newcastle upon Tyne, and in North Tyneside which I have seen for myself and about which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has had much to say. This is not a question of a throwaway remark. We are talking about services for the people who live in those communities.<br><br>
I doubt that we can make progress in this argument. I feared that there would be a chasm between us and that fear is becoming a reality. We want authorities to provide efficient and effective services at acceptable levels of council tax. The Opposition do not accept that. They seem not to want improvements in efficiency or the elimination of unnecessary layers of administration—far from it. They seem intent on creating yet more jobs for the boys and layers of regional government on top of everything else. I wonder whether they ever talk to the leaders of our great cities when they think of taking away power from Newcastle, Birmingham and Liverpool and giving it to a regional government, which will be in between Westminster and those authorities. I believe that their prescription would be to allow local government to carry on regardless and for council taxpayers to pick up the tab as usual. I call on the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the outburst of the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). This is not the same hon. Member for Salisbury whom we saw at the beginning of the Committee proceedings. Never before has there been such uproar in the Committee. It is alarming and sad that the hon. Member for Salisbury is developing this attitude, which is the same as that of his neighbours. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reform because we expected better of him.<br><br>
It is clear that when we put forward a proposal that really goes to the heart of the measure, it disturbs the Minister. I would have preferred him to respond to amendment No. 292, which would require the Secretary of State to explain why an authority should be capped. If the right hon. Gentleman does not want to give reasons in respect of services, that is another matter. At no time, however, have we been told why the Secretary of State should not, in his letter to a local authority which he believes to be spending too much, give his reasons for that belief.<br><br>
The Secretary of State went some way towards meeting our proposal in the Hammersmith and Fulham case, when he said that he did not believe that the capping would disrupt service delivery or cause financial difficulties. Some exercise had obviously been carried out and when pressed

in court, the Secretary of State could comment. The Bill should provide that local authorities are given reasons for the Secretary of State's action and what its effects will be.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Salisbury did not reply to amendment No. 292.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The accent of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) adds greatly to the richness and diversity of our language. However, my hon. Friend the Minister represents a most beautiful part of the country and I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's pronunciation does full justice to the beauty of Salisbury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Very few Conservative Members pronounce the Welsh name of my constituency properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is in a name?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are all very good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on the cost of collecting rubbish in Liverpool. When the Secretary of State proposes capping, does he realise that how far rubbish has to be taken can influence the cost of its collection and disposal? When the Secretary of State is designating an authority, he must take matters such as that into consideration otherwise we will not have a true picture of and response to the level of costs set by the local authority.<br><br>
The Bill as it stands is wrong. It will not help authorities to administer fair local government. We have discussed the basis of our democracy in aspect of parish and town councils, but we have been told that later provisions in the Bill will mean that parish councils can be caught up in the capping procedure. The Secretary of State should at least explain to a parish council—even if not to a metropolitan district, district or county council—why it should be capped. Parish councillors are nearer to the people than anyone. The Secretary of State should explain to them why a parish council should be capped. My amendments would introduce some democracy into the Bill and would help local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I commend amendment No. 292 to the Committee. Amendment No. 256, which stands in my name, gets to the heart of the capping argument.<br><br>
The question is whether we believe in open and accountable local government. Liberal Democrats believe in it, but do the Government? Central Government capping destroys local accountability. We believe that only the local electorate are entitled to a view on local expenditure and they should express their view at the ballot box.<br><br>
If a local authority is thought to be unrepresentative of the local electorate's view, it underlines the fact that the first-past-the-post system has brought about that difference between what is perceived to be the local view and what someone thinks it should be. If we had a fair voting system, we should not need capping, because the local electorate could elect those who decide the spending in a local community.<br><br>
Unless we defeat the clause, we shall have capping. Those who apply capping should be fair and honest enough to tell local communities where the cap should be. It is not enough to say that it is a sum that is capped: those who force it on the local community should explain why it is imposed and how it works. How can local accountability
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 858</span>
be increased if an external organisation such as the Government puts a cap on a budget without saying what services should be reduced? Should the elderly people in the community expect the council to contribute to their bus passes? There is no law that states that a local council should contribute to bus passess, but there is a law that a child between the age of 5 and 16 shall be educated.<br><br>
Do the Government believe that if an authority is capped it should not give grants to voluntary organisations? Many worthy voluntary organisations have provided Opposition Members with excellent briefings. I have in mind the citizens advice bureaux., local pre-school play groups, and many others. Do the Government think that local authorities should help such organisations? If they do, it would be more honest to say so and not leave capped local authorities with the problem of not awarding grants. The withdrawal of grant is then seen as a local authority decision when it is really the decision of the Government.<br><br>
Do the Government take the view of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) that local authorities should not be involved in promoting tourism? Should I tell my constituents in Eastbourne that the Government do not want Eastbourne borough council to spend money on generating tourism in the area?<br><br>
It is interesting to note that the cap will be imposed next year on Eastbourne on an inherited Conservative budget that was supported by the Liberal Democrats. I do not want the Government to argue that this is a political matter and that there is a difference of view between a Liberal Democrat-led council and a Conservative-led council, because there was consensus on a budget that next year the Government will force Eastbourne borough council to reduce. That will mean reducing facilities for tourism, which brings wealth into the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall intervene briefly on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) who is temporarily absent. He said clearly that it was intelligent for his council not to spend money on such items. I should have thought that members on both sides of the Committee would support greater efficiency in council spending. It would be stretching the point to suggest that my hon. Friend was speaking on behalf of the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Government are silent and a Conservative Back-Bench Member expresses a view, Opposition Members have no alternative but to accept it. No one on the Government Front Bench has given an example of an item that could be reduced, or on which a council should not spend its money if it is to be capped. Over 100 district authorities—not a handful, or five or 12—will be capped as a result of these proposals. The Government should state some of the items on which local authorities should not spend money. Should they consider closing swimming pools and leisure centres? Do the Government think that local authorities and borough and district councils should not contribute to highways? They are silent on these issues.<br><br>
The Government take draconian measures and cap authorities but will not say one word about where the axe should fall. Back-Bench Conservatives have made one or two suggestions—tourism was one and we picked it up and ran with it.<br><br>
It defies logic that Ministers should not comment on individual services, but that they can comment, by caping,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0496">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 859</span>
on those individual services put together, saying that an amount is too much for any local authority to spend. They are prepared to state that the total must be capped, but are not prepared to pick individual services and say that local authorities should not deliver them.<br><br>
They will not do that because local people would see that the Government are anti-local government and anti-local services and do not want local people to deliver them. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps someone from the Government Front Bench will say which services are important and which should be cut. There is an absence of comment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not for Ministers to tell local authorities which services should be reconsidered. It is for local authorities to take their own decisions. We shall not remove that responsibility and let them pass the buck.<br><br>
My local county council complained about its education budget, although it had an 11 per cent, increase last year. That local authority has 10,000 empty school places on which the National Audit Office commented but nothing has been done about it. The county councils of Gwynedd and Powys, also rural Welsh counties, have taken action to get a grip on their school budgets. Is it surprising that members of the public wonder what their local county council is doing when it ignores Audit Commission reports about the over-provision of school places and its effect on larger schools in the rest of the county?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot wait for the opportunity to respond to that point. I recall an Audit Commission report on East Sussex county council that showed thousands of empty places in secondary schools. When the county council education committee, under my chairmanship, seriously considered the opportunity that existed, we concluded that it would cost more money to close one of those secondary schools. The Audit Commission named four schools and suggested that one could be closed.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is attempting to make some interesting and pertinent points that arise from his considerable experience of local government. There are, however, many conversations going on in the Committee Room and that should be discouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Audit Commission report for East Sussex concluded that one of the following four secondary schools: Chailey, Uckfield, Crowborough or Hailsham should be closed because all had surplus places. However, the schools are at least 10 miles apart and the cost of busing children from rural communities to the nearest school would have cost more than the savings made by closing one of them. The Audit Commission, which is based in London, applied pure financial statistics without having any knowledge of East Sussex or of how the local secondary school system worked.<br><br>
I am sure that the same logic applies in the authority of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, and that the education committee in that area has very good reasons for not responding. It, too, would have wanted to deliver the most cost-effective education service possible, and any money that it saved could be used to provide the education that it was elected to deliver. The prime objective of local authority officials throughout the United Kingdom is to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 860</span>
deliver the best services possible, whatever political party they belong to. The Government are fooling themselves if they believe that the Audit Commission in London should pontificate on an area of which local people, who wish to serve their community, have rich experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the hon. Gentleman what happens in the local county council in the area that I represent. The education officer introduces plans for the rationalisation of schools, to allow children to receive a rich education by going to schools with more than 10 or 12 pupils. They are sent to the county education committee, but 30 people demonstrate outside and the committee caves in and does not approve the school closures. That shows that there is lack of leadership at county council level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument about surplus places in secondary schools has switched to one about a rural primary school many miles from other schools. I am sure that the Under-Secretary's figures were correct. The number of children that he mentioned was so low that he must have been referring to a primary school because even the Under-Secretary must concede that those figures could not have related to a secondary school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that my experience relates to Scotland. The Tory party always attempts to exploit any rationalisation of schools in Strathclyde region. The most recent and disgraceful example of such exploitation took place in my constituency, where proposals have been made to rezone certain primary schools from one catholic secondary school area to another. The Tory party issued a leaflet, which said that no one in his right mind would send his children to schools in Castlemilk. That is an example of the Tory party exploiting an attempt by local authorities to rationalise the school closure programme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my experience in east Sussex. The Conservative party brings politics into education time and again by attempting to control it from the centre instead of allowing local communities to deliver services. If the Government take these draconian capping powers local councils will no longer be responsible and accountable. The quality and quantity of local services will be reduced. Capping is wrong in principle, and in practice it is extremely damaging. Above all, it is a sympton of everything that is wrong with so-called local democracy.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because the tick of the guillotine clock is with us again and because I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) wants to raise other issues. My hon. Friend, who has been to the shadow Cabinet meeting, will bring good tidings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Labour party got a new leader?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, we do not seek to emulate the Tory party. We do not need what I used to think was called a body lady—someone who cleans up the remains and stuffs the orifices—as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary. At another time I shall explain that to those who did not enjoy village life years ago.<br><br>
The amendments would provide the reasonable man and woman's way of achieving a consensus between central and local government—reaching agreement by discussion, joint consideration of council budget problems, and the examination of all possibilities. Over the past few hours, we have learnt that the Conservative party is completely out of touch with local problems. We are told that six years of capping has not caused cuts in services, although the Government repeatedly said that their intention was to reduce expenditure and to remove some areas of spending from local government budgets so that services provided directly by local authorities were passed to the marketplace.<br><br>
Many of us sat in this Room in January, February and March 1988 and listened to the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley). Incidentally, Mr. Leadbitter, I hope that I pronounced that constituency correctly. As a mere northerner, I do not want to be corrected by anyone from Cannock Chase. The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) represents that part of the world, even if he does not live there, and he knows all about diction.<br><br>
Ministers should not tell local government about what they believe is going on locally. We all know that draconian cuts have been made across the country. Those of us who have children in state schools also know what is happening to support services and to education for special needs. "Out of mind, out of sight"—that is the Conservative party's motto for people who need back-up support such as is provided by the educational psychology service, which performs assessments for statementing or for special needs resulting from dyslexia. Some of us know only too well what is going on because we experience it in our ordinary lives. We do not send our children off to private schools, where teachers fall over themselves to sort out problems and where the pupil-teacher ratio is about half that in state schools. We do not have nannies to look after our children when we have a speaking engagement.<br><br>
Conservative Members do not have a clue about the realities of life. We do not want lectures about the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 862</span>
incompetence or inadequacy of local government from a Government who have spent £10 billion messing up the administration of local government and bringing major distress to people's lives. The poll tax has wrought havoc with the delivery of services. That has affected everybody, not only those who cannot afford to pay the tax. Conservative Members are the last people to give us any such lecture.<br><br>
It would be a good idea if, as the amendments suggest, central Government discussed appropriate levels of service with local authorities. Perhaps Ministers should spend time in local authorities and see what it is like to make the impossible decisions that their policy directives demand. Let them discover what it is like to say, "No, you cannot have a home help" to a carer who is trying to support a mentally handicapped adult. Let them try to explain that spending levels are too high. Over the past few years, central Government have trotted out many things that should be cut—publicity departments, women's units, race equality units and so on. When those have been eliminated, only the services that cost big money are left—education and social services. Now they are to be cut. Ministers know little about them because they do not use them and they do not have to make decisions about where cuts are to be made.<br><br>
I was leader of Sheffield council for two years. I am one of those who know what decisions have to be taken. But that was in the early years of capping. For six years—or, including the current round, seven years—some authorities have suffered capping. In that time, central Government have set the annual budget and then blamed the local authorities the next year. The Government have reintroduced capping, stopped it when authorities dropped their spending levels, then capped them again when the ceiling was reached. Last year, some authorities that achieved the Government target were capped.<br><br>
Absurd decisions have been taken. Those taking them are out of touch with reality. Local authorities must be able to discuss their problems with a quality commission. When central Government or the quality commission is worried about the efficiency or quality of service, a management team should be used. Positive measures should be used to put things right, not capping, ridicule or abuse of local government, which do not help to improve services.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No competitive tendering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore the Minister's sedentary intervention. He may seek to intervene in the usual fashion. The Minister of State rebutted the proposal to cap parish councils, because the Government realise that central Government cannot get too involved in local government affairs as they do not have the necessary information. When my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham speaks to amendment No. 80, he will mention that matter.<br><br>
I hope that local government Ministers and civil servants will soon create a new partnership with local government. I hope that Ministers in the Department will understand something about running services at local level and will be keen to change the ethos of their Department so that those services will be delivered. The Minister of State understands that when central Government cap a local authority, it has nothing to do with efficiency and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0498">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 863</span>
effectiveness and everything to do with punishing local people for wanting a different level of spending and a different policy from central Government.<br><br>
We had a load of drivel from the new PPS to the former Prime Minister about how local people in a village should be stopped from opening a new facility. Those who carried out the failed coup in August in the Soviet Union against Mikhail Gorbachev and his reforms, which have been applauded by our Government, would have been proud of the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood. He wanted petty interference into every little decision made by local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is a Stalinist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend described the hon. Gentleman as a Stalinist. Who am I to disagree? Stalin believed in interfering with people's day-to-day lives and taking away from local people the power to make decisions. He interfered with the cultural diversity and pluralism that people value in a democracy. People should be able to raise money for a village hall or another facility without some jumped-up Government telling them that such an action threatens the economic viability of the nation.<br><br>
Instead of the controversy and conflict that capping inevitably creates, we want local and central Government to co-operate—<i>[Interruption.]</i> We are getting a fair amount of heckling from the Under-Secretaries of State for England and for Wales. They are working in unholy unison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not in tandem. They would not have fitted on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend reminds me that if I had said "in tandem", it would have been a description of them that beggared belief. Central Government do not, and should not, know the nature of individual decisions to be taken or the particular circumstances of the local community. That is why we have had local government for the past 388 years and that is why the Opposition are intent on defending it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to speak only for a couple of minutes, but the Secretary of State provoked me. He has only to look at me in order to provoke me.—<i>[Laughter.]</i> I am being unfair because it was actually the disgraceful heckling of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) by the two Under-Secretaries of State that provoked me. They remind me of Burke and Hare, who used to sneak in the night and rob coffins. These two gentlemen rob the coffers of local authorities and weave as much heartache from their exercise.<br><br>
The amendments go to the heart of the relationship between local government and the Secretary of State. Over the years, the Secretary of State, whoever that happened to be, has ridden roughshod over the requirements of local government and, despite some sham consultations, he has rejected the proposals put forward by many local authorities, including Wigan, in my constituency. The Minister alluded to that in a debate a few days ago, when he said that he was happy to see my friends from Wigan council, as he seems to do on almost an annual basis. I think that, in the privacy of his office, he accepts my council friends' argument about the inappropriate way in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 864</span>
which the SSAs have been capped. The Under-Secretary is shaking his head, but I have been to the meetings—not with him, but with one of the other Under-Secretaries or a former Under-Secretary.<br><br>
In those meetings, the Government were clearly embarrassed that they had capped an authority that was spending below the average that was being spent by metropolitan authorities. The amendment would open up the consultative exercise between the Secretary of State and local authorities. That exercise would no longer be used only as a mechanism whereby the Secretary of State can make a statement in the House and, within one month, local authorities like Wigan, are thrown into financial chaos and forced to make reductions in core services.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brightside referred to the Government trotting out women's centres, gay centres and all the other excuses for loony right attacks on local authorities. In Wigan, which has been capped, we have never had a women's department or a gay rights department. We have none of those expensive items, which, according to the Tories, can be done better by agencies other than local authorities. Wigan has been capped for the past two years. For the life of me, I and my council colleagues—I was a member of the council—cannot find a single rational argument being put forward by the Government which explains why it finds itself in that position.<br><br>
For example, in education, Wigan local authority spends, on average, £415 per adult. The average permitted to metropolitan authorities is £452. We provide a service for at least £37 per head less than most metropolitan authorities—capped. Personal social services spend, on average, £82 per adult; metropolitan authorities spend, on average, £115—a massive saving—capped. Highway maintenance cost £39 a head in Wigan, the average was £46. The service was provided for below-average cost, but it was still capped. On general services the authority spent £103 a head, compared to a metropolitan average of £136. Again that was a considerable saving per head; again, it was capped.<br><br>
The authority has one of the largest areas of land dereliction and redevelopment because of the ending of coal mining and textile manufacture in the borough. It is one of the largest areas of land dereliction in Europe and it receives specific grants for that. The authority has probably the best record in Britain for a rolling programme of providing land from derelict sources for environmental, leisure, industrial and commercial purposes. In capital terms, that land is provided at below the average cost for metropolitan authorities. The authority is still capped.<br><br>
Can the Minister give me a plausible argument for capping? On all tests of the provision of facilities and resources by metropolitan boroughs, pound for pound, the authority has always been, and will continue to be, below the average of other metropolitan authorities. Yet it is still capped. The Minister should explain that.<br><br>
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside are important. They would provide an opportunity for the Secretary of State to give local authorities detailed reasons on how they can be capped if they spend less than the average for other authorities while others who are spending above that average are not capped. That is why my hon. Friends and I are against the whole concept of capping. It has done a great disservice to local government.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0499">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 865</span>
The Minister, as I expected, made party political points. I do not mind that because we are all politicians and grown up enough to realise that the run up to the election will be hard fought. In between the fighting, the arguments and the point scoring, it should be remembered that councillors are voluntary workers. They give their time and services freely. The Conservatives should remember that and not undermine councillors and their position in the community.<br><br>
Irrespective of whether they are Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat councillors, the overwhelming majority of those who serve on councils do it because of their commitment to the local community. Many councillors that I know do it to the detriment of their own careers, families and pension contributions. The continued attacks on councillors is leading to a bleeding away of people prepared to serve on councils. It is time that the Government stopped their personalised attacks on councillors. The vast majority provide a service to the community and many people welcome their contribution.<br><br>
Primary education is one of the core elements of local authority expenditure. My hon. Friend the Member for Brightside listed the types of services provided, including remedial work and statementing. I recently inherited a constituent from the south of England. He has a severely disabled autistic child. My authority inherited a statement from the orginal authority, which had not been poll-tax-capped. My authority, rightly, accepted the terms of the statement and the child's need for a specialised educational establishment. That poll-tax-capped authority has now had to find in excess of £18,000 for that stated child. There will be no transfer of resources from the authority that was not poll tax capped. Because my local authority is caring for the needs of disabled children, it has accepted that additional cost. In the next few weeks it will have to cut funding because the Minister will be the last person to recognise that contribution.<br><br>
My authority has spent over £1 million in preparing for the care in the community measures and in bringing back into the community people with severe mental and physical disabilities. The average cost is between £30,000 and £32,000 per placement, yet the Government provide only £18,000. The shortfall must be met by the poll tax capped authority.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
If it were not for that contribution by my authority, the Government could not implement its care in the community programme. Without local authorities, individuals cannot come back into the community because it is the authorities that provide the necessary core services. None the less, my authority has been poll tax capped for introducing and implementing in a first-class, professional way the Government's proposals on care in the community.<br><br>
Many local authority officers and staff are angered also at the Government's continuing imposition of additional statutory obligations regarding children, for example, while giving not a penny of additional resources to authorities to implement those duties. Then, when a breakdown in services occurs or a child is abused, the local authority is attacked first. No consideration is given to whether sufficient resources are provided and the authority is understaffed or to the huge caseload of social workers because of the understaffing and underfunding of other departments. People are angry at the Government

shuffling off primary legislative measures to local authorities, with financial consequences that the Government are not prepared to meet.<br><br>
If the Minister perseveres with his policies towards my local authority, I shall ask him for a personal meeting. I realise that I have gone on about this all week, but it is important. The statement last week by the Secretary of State suggested a loss of about £21 million in income to my authority, yet he expects it to provide services for less money than it had four years ago. In the intervening period another dose of additional commitment has been imposed on the authority through educational measures, the Children Act 1989 and the care in the community measures. I shall ask the Minister for a meeting, not just to go through the motions but genuinely to consider the position.<br><br>
I realise that the Minister has a political problem; if he gives way with Wigan, he may have to give way with another six authorities in a similar band. However, the reason for such meetings is to sort out these problems. The Minister cannot run away from the matter and cannot simply blame local authorities for reductions in services. If the Government recognise, through their urban programme, that authorities such as Wigan have special needs, they cannot give £5 million or £6 million in urban aid and then take away £21 million. It makes no sense to leave them £15 million short. We should meet the Minister to find a way to claw back some of that shortfall, which is the result of how SSAs are calculated. The Government have got themselves into an appalling cul-de-sac regarding the allocation of revenue support grant to metropolitan authorities such as mine.<br><br>
I know that, for political reasons, the Minister will say that he is happy to meet me any time. However, at the end of the meeting, I should like a detailed statement on why an authority that spends below the average of other metropolitan authorities can be capped. I should like the Minister to include the reasons, department by department and service by service, for forcing my authority to lose millions of pounds and to provide better and more professional services at a cost which four years ago he and his predecessor said would be met from adequate funding. Now, when that same funding level is proposed, the authorities are told that they are indulging in irrational overspending and will have to be capped.<br><br>
The Minister cannot have it both ways, and my authority is entitled to a far better explanation than he has been prepared to give.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed that we never found out what the glad tidings from the shadow Cabinet were. Whatever they were, they fired the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) as though an electric shock had been passed through him. He made a spirited speech, redolent with the imagery of class warfare. Throughout its length, I longed for the reappearance of the millionaires and estate agents who have characterised most of the class warfare waged by the Opposition. In their place, came nannies and private schools, other important parts of Labour mythology, to sustain the attack.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Demonology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Uncharacteristically, the hon. Gentleman supplies me with the bon mot of demonology.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Leadbitter, I am always happy to help the Minister with the paucity of his vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have taken careful note of that remark.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brightside was concerned about pupil-teacher ratios, but they are better today than they were in 1979. He was also concerned about social services, but we are now in a period of tremendous advance as we increasingly tailor the social services to the demands of the client groups. We continue to get away from institutions by designing packages for individuals and focussing more on keeping them in their homes or enabling them to be settled in the community. Those advances are due to a partnership between central Government and local government, to which we are giving more responsibility. That flies in the face of the frequent accusations of Labour Members that we are depriving local authorities of their powers.<br><br>
Labour Members never seem to see the contradiction of their position. On one hand, they claim that we are taking away power from local authorities. On the other, they claim that we undercompensate them for all their new responsibilities. What are those new responsibilities if they are not new powers for areas in which local authorities will operate?<br><br>
There is ebb and flow in those matters. The Government have removed some powers. For example, we recently decided that tertiary education should be removed from local authorities. However, in respect of other matters, the authorities are given new responsibilities, for example, for dealing with litter, care in the community and social services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Minister is clever and glib. There is a vast difference between giving extra powers and imposing extra obligations. We are talking about additional obligations that are imposed without the power to raise resources to meet them. When local authorities attempt to meet those obligations they face not only a risk, but the reality, of being capped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman leads me to my next comment. Labour Members believe that any restriction on what local authorities can raise in local taxation will remove from them all power and local accountability. But that is not the case. People in local government have an important and potentially satisfying job to do in serving as officers and as elected members and by providing services for local people at the best possible value for money and to the highest possible quality.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) said that he was worried because the role of the local councillor in his area has been diminished. In areas such as Wandsworth, services of high quality are delivered because an excellent job of management has been done, and the community charge has been reduced. The councillors in Wandsworth are men and women who walk tall. Their achievement ripples through the entire council and its officers are held in the highest regard for having delivered value for money in providing high standards of service. They do not complain about cappinng, because they never come anywhere near being capped.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 868</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make it abundantly clear that the only reason Conservative members of Wandsworth council walk tall is that they have shaken the disadvantaged off their backs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The comment does not stand up to scrutiny. I have every reason to believe that that council's social services provision is of an extremely high quality. The authority provides universal nursery education in Wandsworth—a provision that is unique in London. That service is provided on the basis of a zero community charge. The statement of the hon. Member for Brightside is wrong. Anyone who lives in London knows that the reductions in the community charge in Wandsworth, and the reduction in the rates over many years before that, have not taken place at the expense of services. On the contrary, Wandsworth's services are of a higher quality than those provided in the neighbouring area. Many residents of Lambeth yearn to go to Wandsworth, not only because of its low community charge, but because of its superior services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'> (Torridge and Devon, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert on Wandsworth, but in my constituency there certainly exists the provision of high-quality services and low community charges. The local councillors are respected by the community. Torridge local authority provides some of the best social services in the United Kingdom and has a low community charge. It is extremely economical and nobody could fault its social services. West Devon is just as good. I endorse the Minister's remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Fjriend. Because we respond to the contributions that are made by Opposition Members, there is a danger of us seeming to take a jaundiced view of local government or of our implying that local government does not provide a good service. That is not true. Many authorities, such as that in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis), are doing excellent jobs, and we are happy to pay tribute to them. They often quietly get on with their business; they do not draw their position to the attention of the press or of the Government. None the less, we appreciate their silent and dedicated efforts. All those who work so hard and achieve so much are a great credit to local government.<br><br>
I am not sure whether we have failed to get over to the hon. Member for Makerfield the basics of SSAs or whether his local treasurer does not communicate certain information to him. There is no reason why his local authority should have the same SSA as another local authority. If each local authority had the same SSA, there would be no point in having the system. Therefore, whether his authority's SSA is at the average, above the average or below the average level is of no significance. All that matters is on what his authority is spending in relation to its SSA.<br><br>
Yesterday, the hon. Gentleman said that he was puzzled by two authorities within 16 miles of each other having different SSAs. My goodness, he would be the first to be amazed if Mayfair and Brixton—which are a mile and a half apart—had the same SSA. It is absurd to believe that proximity or distance can be a determining factor in the SSAs. When setting those assessments, account is taken of social conditions, the ethnic background of an area's residents, the number of families living on income support, the number of one-parent families and so on.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0501">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 869</span>
We consider the results of research into certain characteristics of an area, for example, social services and education. We would know from that which children are in need of special attention and who, therefore, are more expensive to educate or to care for. The SSA tries to identify such factors.<br><br>
I shall no doubt be meeting delegations led by Members of Parliament. But to ensure that those meetings are productive, we have a right to ask that a Member of Parliament should write in advance saying not just that his or her SSA is below the average—that does not tell us anything—but why he or she believes that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way in which it has been calculated. If we receive such letters, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I, within the bounds of the time available, will seriously consider the requests for meetings.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Minister tends to be condescending, as is his wont. With or without the help of the borough treasurer, I am quite capable of understanding the effects of the SSA and the ideology behind it. It is because I understand it that I am not prepared to accept the Minister's glib excuses and patronising attempts to tell me why my authority gets 50 per cent, less for providing children's services than Wandsworth.<br><br>
If the Minister cannot accept the argument as applied to Wigan and Wandsworth, he should accept it in terms of the average permissible expenditure for authorities. My authority spends less than the average authority on all services, yet it is capped. That shows the fundamental unfairness of the system. Those who spend less than the average authorities are capped.<br><br>
The Minister said that capping, in principle, was designed to deal with unfettered spending by authorities. If such authorities, irrespective of their obligations to the community, were to spend, spend and spend, I could understand his argument, but he cannot apply that argument to my local authority. It is underspending, underspending and underspending yet it is capped. The Minister should stop being glib and get down to the facts. He should agree to a meeting with Members of Parliament and have it out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has reacted rather extremely. I took care to say that it might have been my failure to explain capping to him, but if it is, clearly it is a continuing failure. I have just said that it makes no difference what the averages are: SSAs are about establishing the conditions in individual areas, including metropolitan districts. The fact that there is a difference between Manchester and Wigan, which are both metropolitan districts, has nothing to do with the argument. Social conditions in Manchester are different from those in Wigan. That is precisely what the SSA tries to pick up.<br><br>
I should like to correct the hon. Member for Makerfield on two details. First, in 1991–92 Wigan was not capped, whereas it was in the previous year. Secondly, although the hon. Gentleman claims that Wigan underspends, this year it was not capped, even though it overspent its SSA by 5 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, Wigan was self-capped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ha.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 870</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister laughs glibly. We have real problems. If we cannot discuss them without Conservative Members making glib comments, what chance have ordinary people got through parliamentary representation?<br><br>
To reach the Government's requirements not to be capped, my authority capped itself. That is what the system was originally designed to do; it forced local authorities to make major cuts in their budgets. Because that was not successful enough, the Government have come back for more. Unless my authority reduces its budget by about £20 million, the Minister will cap it.<br><br>
I am trying to persuade the Minister in a fair-minded way that we should have a proper discussion about the situation in Wigan. The Minister and his hon. Friends know from their visits to Wigan that the council provides services in a value-for-money way. If he does not believe that, he would not say what he says publicly in Wigan about the authority. The Secretary of State would not quote the example of Wigan's services in a party-political broadcast. We cannot keep Ministers away from Wigan. They utilise our facilities and services for their own ends, but despite that, they will not treat Wigan fairly. All I want is a meeting to put our case. If I were a Conservative Member would the Minister expect me to go through the rigmarole of writing letters so that he could decide whether he was free to meet me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh yes I would—it is pantomime time of year! I would ask any hon. Member to do that. That is perfectly reasonable.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that Wigan had to cut its budget by £20 million. According to my calculations, it is allowed to increase its budget by 4·6 per cent. Presumably, it must cut £20 million from plans that had been made, but it certainly does not have to cut £20 million from its current spending. It can increase its spending in the coming year.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the common people. That is why we have introduced capping. What about the £43 per head that Wigan's spending at 5 per cent, over its SSA means for the people in Wigan? What about the 80p per week that those people must spend on that addition to their SSA? I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman sees things only through the eyes of the local authority and the services that it wants to provide—particularly the money that it wants to spend—and why he does not view these matters from the point of view of the taxpayer, for whom, in other guises, the Opposition shed crocodile tears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Burt <span class='memberconstituency'> (Bury, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all have sympathy with local authorities which are struggling to provide basic services and which complain about the adjustments made by the Government against them. Does my hon. Friend share my concern about a letter that I received a few days ago from a lady who writes that she has
<br><blockquote><p>"recently joined Manchester City Council's Nuclear Policy and Information Unit as a Local Development Worker"?</p></blockquote>
That lady explains that, although she was born and raised in Newcastle, she has spent most of her adult life in the United States working on
<br><blockquote><p>"campaigns against nuclear power, conscription, Trident, the arms race, radioactive waste, war toys, and campaigns for renewable energy".</p></blockquote>
She describes her work at the nuclear policy subcommittee of Manchester city council as updating its publicity material and working initially on researching

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 871</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Manchester's dependence on arms production and the potential for diversification and conversion to civilian production";</p></blockquote>
secondly, conducting
<br><blockquote><p>"an investigation into what materials are being sent to local schools by the Nuclear Industry with a view to analysis by a science educator for bias and omission. The plan is to develop more balanced educational materials";</p></blockquote>
and thirdly, investigating
<br><blockquote><p>"the frequency of Civilian and military nuclear transportation through the city"</p></blockquote>
and examining
<br><blockquote><p>"the soundness of emergency planning for accidents involving radioactive materials."</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend believe that a nuclear policy sub-committee for information and dissemination is such a core service that that worker has recently been engaged by Manchester city council although it is screaming that it needs more money for core services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a telling intervention. The hon. Member for Makerfield said that those who denounced such things were on the loony right. That is not so. The mass of the general public is fed up with that carry-on. The public is worried about the loony left, not the loony right. In one way, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) may have helped the hon. Member for Makerfield, because part of the hon. Gentleman's case is that Manchester's SSA is too high compared with Wigan's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a shroud-waving exercise every year by many Labour authorities? They produce spending plans well above the realistic limit for their area, just so that they can say that they had to cut them when the RSG is known. They know full well that they had no intention of spending at that level because of the charges that local poll tax payers would have had to pay. It is all an attempt to gain publicity before the poll tax is raised, rather than considering a realistic figure in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Clearly, Conservative Members are trying to waste time by multiplying examples of people who they think have a justifiable complaint. However, the people who elect those councils have a different point of view. The result may be that we will not reach the Scottish clauses in the Bill because of Conservative Members wasting time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. As I have pointed out from time to time, such a comment is unfortunately a criticism of the Chair. However, I am sure that the hon. Lady made it inadvertently and not as a criticism.<br><br>
I must point out that the amendment invites such contributions. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"appropriate to the needs of its area."</p></blockquote>
That covers an exceptionally wide field. Hon. Members can either generalise or particularise. I remind the Committee of my defensive position in keeping order. It is difficult when hon. Members, by their comments, invite tedious repetition; but until now members of the Committee have been ingenious enough to avoid that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One feature of the allocation of time is that some of my hon. Friends feel more free to contribute than they might otherwise have done. They have not abused that position, but it has made life uncomfortable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 872</span>
for the Opposition. For the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), to leap to her feet on a point of order because two pieces of light ammunition were hurled across the Room is a sign of tremendous sensitivity. I have spoken for 15 minutes, and taken many interventions, in a debate which has lasted an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister ponder for a moment why my hon. Friends genuinely feel rather irritated by his response? I speak particularly for my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). The Minister tends to dismiss all complaints about the comparative levels of SSAs on the ground that disparities are to be expected. Of course, no one expects an arithmetical average to be established, but my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield constantly puts a point to the Minister—with which the Minister will not deal. A group of local authorities with similar social, economic and demographic characteristics that have disparities in their SSAs of 50, 60 or 70 per cent, is a phenomenon that causes eyebrows to raise and it leads people to question the calculations that produced such an outcome. The Minister has said nothing to show that he recognises his obligation to answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I explained that point to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti). The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) asserts—on what basis I have no idea—that those metropolitan districts have similar social characteristics. The standard spending assessments, which examine social characteristics in each area, show that social characteristics are different. Evidence about social characteristics is linked through a methodology to be reflected in the standard spending assessment. The composition of the methodology is the result of research into what makes the standard level of service more expensive in one place than in another. That methodology was extensively discussed and thrashed out with local authority associations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham wishes all that to be set aside. As a matter of intuition, he asserts that the social characteristics of those districts that are shown by research to be different are the same, but his intuition is pitted against evidence. When the two come into conflict, the hon. Gentleman has no doubt which side of the fence to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again we have a classic example of what I reluctantly describe as the Minister's arrogance. He seems unable to understand that his assertion that the evidence is accurate is not convincing. It is that assertion which my hon. Friends question and which the hon. Gentleman is unwilling to defend. He simply reasserts it.<br><br>
Of the authorities that were capped in 1990–91, five had never been rate-capped before, yet according to the Audit Commission, those five had similar social, economic and demographic characteristics, and included the local authority district of Wigan in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield. It is too much of a coincidence to accept that, of the cluster of six local authorities found by the Audit Commission to share similar characteristics, five were capped for the first time. Is the Minister saying that that shows that the system is working well? It suggests to me that there was something wrong with the SSAs for those local authorities.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 873</span>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The SSA replaced the grant-related expenditure assessment which had been in force for several years. SSAs used more modern ideology, benefits from recent research, and from data that was more up to date; the fact that SSAs, for many authorities, were different from GREAs, is no surprise. There was no agreement about GREAs, which were the subject of enormous controversy. It was often said, not least by the Labour party, that GREAs were too complicated and that a simpler system should be found. SSAs are pretty complicated, but they are simpler.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Makerfield took badly my remark about his local treasurer, but I did not intend any insult to the hon. Gentleman. I merely asked if his local treasurer had told him the whole story. I am challenged to go into detail about Wigan, but in common with other authorities, Wigan is provided with masses of information about the composition of its SSA. The method of calculation, the weighting for each factor and the multipliers used are given and so is the result in terms of SSA for education and social services. The information is broken down, piece by piece.<br><br>
Local authorities often claim that they have no idea how the calculation was made, but that is untrue. They have every idea: they have reports setting out the methodology and the calculations as they apply to each local authority. What is more, there is a double consultation period every year, one with local authority associations to discuss how SSAs might be updated and improved. This year, half-a-dozen improvements resulting from that discussion were announced. In the second part of the consultation, each local authority has time in which to comment on its SSA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The discussion has taken me back many years to the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, which changed the system under which, prior to that time, authorities that spent substantially higher sums attracted substantially more grant. That was criticised, not just by Conservative Members, because it was monstrously unfair and the system was rightly rejected. To judge from the arguments advanced by some Opposition Members, they want to go back to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Portillo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. There is a strand of such thinking in comments by Labour and Liberal Democrat spokesmen.<br><br>
It is true that when local authorities challenge their cap, Ministers exercise an important power. The amendment provides that, if a local authority is capped, the spending should be set at the level that the local authority believes that it needs to provide the services. That is a way of blowing capping out of the water, as the Opposition intend. I make it clear that, when local authorities challenge their caps, the Government go out of our way to ensure that their case is given the fullest consideration. We consider the matter exhaustively and listen carefully to the arguments. We go through a list of questions. We ask for written material to be submitted and we consider the evidence carefully. The record shows that we have always exercised our judgment. A local authority's cap may not vary, because we consider matters carefully when we set it. In some cases, the cap may vary, but in every case we take our responsibility extremely seriously.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brightside spoke about a new dawn in a relationship betwen a possible Labour
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 874</span>
Government and local authorities. He had better talk about that to Albert Little of Ramsbottom. The previous Labour Government adopted the same attitude to local authorities as they did to blacklists, sanctions and cutting the capital programme. No one outside believes that a Labour Government would greet a new dawn of trust and co-operation. If anybody does, he almost deserves a Labour Government, but, fortunately, one will not be elected anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister defended a system that creates SSAs on all-ages indices of social need and places Wandsworth and Westminster among the top 12 deprived boroughs in Britain and places such as Rotherham, Barnsley and Wigan in the 140s and 170s. The system is absurd. Anyone who has lived in a deprived area for any length of time knows about deprivation. The Government know that unemployment should be part of the indices and that the growing number of elderly should be given proper weighting. They know that it is daft to invent indices, apply them through SSAs in a distorted fashion and then apply capping based on the original faulty indices, thereby justifying cuts made in disadvantaged areas. It is a vicious circle that rewards those who have foreign visitors in Westminster and punishes those in Barnsley, Rotherham and Wigan who do not. We shall sweep away that silly system.<br><br>
Albert Little of Ramsbottom will remember the days when local authorities could spend time delivering services, rather than have to face an antagonistic, diversifying, unpleasant Tory Government who are intent on doing away with the very thing that most people go into local government to achieve.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Amendment No. 280 is important. It deals with the right of local authorities and their taxes payers to basic information on their bills and on the cuts in services that they will suffer when their local authority is capped.<br><br>
We should have had time for a substantial debate on this important issue, but the guillotine now threatens. We are anxious that time should be left to debate some of the Scottish provisions. Therefore, I do not intend to move the amendment. This is another instance of the way in which the guillotine prevents the Committee from debating important measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of fact, I was just discussing how close amendment No. 280 was to a previous group of amendments. I suppose that the hon. Member noted that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), I shall be brief. I wish to talk about the difference between the administration of the council tax in Wales and England and to ask the Minister some simple questions about the cost of that administration.<br><br>
One of the disasters of the poll tax in Wales was the enormous cost of its administration. It cost more than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V001P0I0504">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 875</span>
£100 million to set up, administer and sweeten the poll tax in Wales. The last thing that the people of Wales want is a repeat performance of that disaster.<br><br>
I understand that the Government propose, on the basis of their consultant's report, to approve £7·98 million of revenue expenditure and £1·24 million of capital expenditure for Welsh district councils in respect of council tax start-up costs. Provisional returns from Welsh district treasurers indicate a total cost of £11·5 million to £12 million rather than the £9·22 million proposed by the Welsh Office. I understand that the Council of Welsh Districts questions the capital provision figure in view of the relatively low forecast costs in the consultant's sample. The Council of Welsh Districts has therefore requested a capital provision of some £3 million instead of the £1·24 million proposed by the Government, which was based on the England and Wales average capital costs per unit of property. I deliberately read from my notes slowly, so that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales could find his reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 62 requires separate administration of capping in Wales and England, and this reflects the present system. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales has responsibility for local government finance in Wales.<br><br>
I did not recognise the figure of £100 million quoted by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). I do not have the figures for expenditure to hand, but I am certain that they are nothing like those of the hon. Gentleman. From memory, I think that it is about £10 million for the start-off costs and that this year it is about £30 million to administer the community charge. So I believe that the hon. Gentleman's figures are way out.<br><br>
On the expenses for helping local authorities with the council tax implementation, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced in the House about two weeks ago that 75 per cent, of the cost of implementing the council tax would be taken outside the aggregate external finance and that £5·986 million of new money would be available to local authorities to help them with the implementation costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that answers my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It could be more exact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The district councils in Wales have been very exact. They have said that they will not be given sufficient money to set up and administer the council tax. I assure the Under-Secretary of State for Wales that my figures on the poll tax incuded the sweetening element—transitional relief—as well as the administrative costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now I understand that the hon. Gentleman is objecting to the £62 million that is available this year for transitional relief in Wales. I do not consider that to be a sweetner, or part of administration costs. It reflects the ability to help residents in Wales and the 700-odd community councils, which benefit from having a lower community charge than they would otherwise have. If the hon. Gentleman sees that as a sweetner, he is on his own. I consider it to be a worth while sum that has been made available by my right hon. Friend to assist with the transition from rates in high-rated areas to the community charge.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 876</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the tax had been any good in the first place, it would not have had to be sweetened. My aim in this stand part debate is to pinpoint the administrative costs of the new tax. If it is not right now, it will become worse in the months to come. The £100 million that has been squandered might as well hve been dumped into the Bristol channel for all the good that it has done.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can almost breathe a sigh of relief and say, "At long last." I have listened to Ministers rabbiting on about democracy and control. They reminded me of the Tory lady who, when Labour swept the country in the 1945 general election said, "It's outrageous. A Labour Government? People won't stand for it." That is exactly the attitude of Conservative Members. They believe that, however people vote, it does not matter—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Hon. Members bear out my point. Conservative Members cannot stand democracy: if people do not like what they say, they try to find a way round it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me that after the 1964 Labour victory the same lady would have attached a sticker to the back of her car saying, "Don't blame me, I voted Conservative"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have done her a fat lot of good in Scotland. In the past one-and-a-half days we have seen exactly what is wrong with this process with regard to Scotland. Opposition Members have been discussing the issues, not wasting time. Yesterday we dealt with 23 clauses relating to England and five relating to Scotland—and the Scottish clauses were tagged on at the end. Today we are discussing 11 clauses relating to rate-capping in England, and one Scottish clause, again tagged on at the end. The Government call that democracy and say that a proper discussion has taken place with regard to Scotland. That is a disgrace to the procedures of the House of Commons, and this clause is a disgrace to democracy.<br><br>
The attitude of Conservative Members to Scotland is shown not in their approach to a Scottish parliament or devolution of power to Scotland, but in the way that they treat Scottish business in this Parliament. The Scottish National party wants devolution although the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats do not. However, the Conservative party threatens the union of the United

Kingdom because it treats the people of Scotland with disrespect and arrogance, and takes no account of the views of the Scottish people.<br><br>
The powers being introduced into Scotland by the Government are new. We do not have a record of the Minister's series of meetings about rate-capping of local authorities in Scotland. The new powers fly in the face of the comments of Scottish people about local government for the past 12 years. Of 54 local authorities, three small district councils are controlled by the Conservative party. The people of Scotland have spoken time and again; they do not want the Conservative party to control their lives. They want to decide local authority expenditure for themselves. They do not want Ministers to say to the people of Strathclyde or Glasgow, "You're wrong. That is not what you really want. You shall have what I say you want: this is your level of spending." But that would happen under the clause.<br><br>
At least in the past Scottish legislation included the phrase "excessive and unreasonable", which forced Ministers to explain why they thought that expenditure was not only excessive but unreasonable. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will explain the change.<br><br>
Scottish Office Ministers do not represent the people of Scotland. I am saying not that there should be no Scottish Office Ministers—I accept the Union of the United Kingdom under Parliament—but that there should be a Scottish parliament, of which the Ministers might not be part, within the framework of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The Ministers should have some respect for the views of the Scottish people when they frame legislation. They should have respect for local democracy and for the local electorate that has decided what sort of local council it wants—as I have said, 51 councils in Scotland are not Tory surely, Ministers should show such respect now.<br><br>
Over the years, local authorities in Scotland have done a tremendous job protecting the people of Scotland from the Government's worst excesses. The Government cannot stand that. Equally, the Government have found it increasingly annoying that they have not had to use their capping powers in Scotland. We are entitled to ask why, 12 years on, the Government want to introduce new powers.<br><br>
As the Government introduced the poll tax a year earlier in Scotland than in England and Wales, local authorities in Scotland now face a major expenditure crisis. In today's <i>Glasgow Herald,</i> we read about such problems in Strathclyde region—the largest local authority in the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The largest local authority in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is probably right.<br><br>
It is because of the uncollectability of the poll tax that Strathclyde faces a £250 million deficit in the coming year—10 per cent, of its annual expenditure. As a result, it is likely to be forced to raise the poll tax by 30 per cent, next year and, at the same time, cut its budget by £30 million. Strathclyde will have to cut expenditure on the services—such as education, social work, and transport—on which it wanted to increase spending to compensate for cuts that it had been forced to make in previous years. In Strathclyde, 750 redundancies are likely.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 878</span>
I ask the Minister a simple question: because Strathclyde must increase its poll tax by 30 per cent., will it be capped? That is the logic of the Government's proposals. Throughout Scotland, local authorities will be forced to increase their poll tax not because they want to increase their budgets or spend too much money but because of the enormous poll tax mess that the Government have created.<br><br>
Lothian region is one such area. The Minister shakes his head. I should be delighted learn that that is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of fact, capping applies to the budget and not the the charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it applies to the budget, but the poll tax would be reduced as a consequence. In Scotland, Ministers at least accept that when deciding whether a budget is excessive, the figures are not worked out scientifically; they come off the top of their heads. I have never managed to find a Minister who could explain the calculations scientifically. The only Minister I knew who understood local government finance was Bruce Millan. I have never found a Tory Minister who understood the process of deciding whether a budget is excessive. It is an arbitrary decision. Lothian and Edinburgh, in particular, face the prospect of being capped.<br><br>
Lothian and Edinburgh are always targets for a Tory Government because most Scottish Office civil servants live there and suffer the so-called impact of higher poll taxes or higher rates. That is why Glasgow and Strathclyde tend not to be targets. No one could possibly describe the Labour-controlled authority in Lothian as being of the loony left. David Begg, the finance convenor in Lothian, is a demon figure to the left in Scotland because he wants to use powers to collect the poll tax!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am becoming a little worried. We are dealing with the setting of the council tax. If the hon. Member is using the poll tax as a critique of the assessment, that is a matter for him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with substitution and reduction, not with the setting of the council tax, Mr. Leadbitter. The Government are taking these powers because they know that Scottish local authorities will have enormous problems year in year out as a result of the Government's maladministration and their imposition of the poll tax on the people of Scotland. The poll tax will have a knock-on effect for years to come. It will affect the setting of the council tax and the setting of budgets in Scotland.<br><br>
I am about to sit down as I am aware that dinner calls and I should like others to speak after dinner. The Government are acting undemocratically throughout the whole of the United Kingdom, but especially in Scotland where they have no popular support. They should have more regard for the views of the people of Scotland and withdraw the clause.</span></p>
