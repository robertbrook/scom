	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This morning, the Committee was discussing amendment No. 125 to clause 5, and the Minister was intervening on the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) when the Committee adjourned. I should advise the Committee that once the hon. Gentleman has completed his remarks, we will consider a resolution of the Programming Sub-Committee. I call the Minister to complete his intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Keith Hill)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Hurst. The caveat is that the periods of revision will clearly depend on local circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's intervention, we have probably taken the matter as far as needed.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Copies of the Programming Sub-Committee's resolution are in the Room. I ask the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Order of the Committee [14th October] be amended, by leaving out from the second occurrence of 'New Schedules' in paragraph 2, and inserting 'Clause 5, Clause 2, Clause 40, Clause 46, Clauses 6 to 11, Clause 15, Clauses 19 to 36, Clauses 44 and 45, Clauses 47 to 53, Clauses 56 to 72, Clauses 79 to 90, Schedules 2 to 6, Clause 1, Clauses 3 and 4, Clauses 12 to 14, Clauses 16 to 18, Clauses 37 to 39, Clauses 41 to 43, Clauses 54 and 55, Clauses 73 to 78, Schedule 1, and the remaining proceedings on the Bill'.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>That the Order of the Committee [14th October] be further amended, at the end, by leaving out '5.15 pm on Thursday 23rd October' and inserting '7.30 pm on Thursday 23rd October'.</p></q>
I draw the Committee's attention to a number of facts. We have had 17 hours of debate to date, and under the terms of the motion we have a further five hours to come. So far, 35 per cent. of the time, or just under six hours, has been spent on Government new clauses; and 65 per cent. of the time, or 11 hours, has been devoted to Opposition new clauses. That seems to be a fair treatment of the Opposition's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have shown considerable restraint. We have been guided almost entirely in the emphasis given to debates by the Opposition—and not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
more so than with new clause 49, on which we spent two and a half hours. In other words, we effectively spent two and half hours dealing with part 2 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed 27 Government new clauses, 30 Government amendments, three new schedules, 20 Opposition new clauses and 18 Opposition amendments, and we have had seven clause stand part debates. It seems to me that proper progress has been made on the Bill. I believe that we have the prospect of further proper consideration. I ought to point that, as we promised, we published the Government amendments well in advance. In addition, as I observed earlier today, we have made every effort to publish the maximum number of planning policy statements and regulations in draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have so far sat for an additional three hours and 18 minutes beyond our normal sitting time of five hours a day. The Committee will be aware that, on Tuesday, we were willing to go on for a further 47 minutes, but that we accommodated the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). We have been extremely fair, and it was not the Government who were taking an excessive amount of the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always been willing to continue the debate. We have remaining before us 49 clauses with amendments, nine of which are in part 2, and we have effectively had a Second Reading debate on new clause 49. A further 18 of those new clauses fall in parts of the Bill that were discussed by the earlier Standing Committee. Although we have always made it clear that the completion date was not movable, we have always been emphatic about our willingness to be flexible. Indeed, at our first sitting, I spoke of
	<br><q><p>"my willingness to be as flexible as possible"—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 14 October 2003; c. 7.]</p></q>
We would have been very happy to yield to an Opposition request for an extra sitting on Wednesdays, but that was not forthcoming. The usual channels have been unusually open, and we have regularly checked on how the Opposition considered the Committee to be progressing. At no time has there been any request for consideration of a Wednesday sitting. In all circumstances, the Government have gone out of their way to accommodate the Opposition. It has been a good Committee so far. Through the motion, we have expressed out willingness to sit for another two and a quarter hours. If we add up all the hours, we will have had an extra day's sitting by the end of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We still need to put one or two things on the record, but we appreciate the flexibility that the Government have shown within the constraints of the motion. I am personally grateful to the Government and the usual channels for allowing the sitting to finish early on Tuesday, which accommodated me. The Minister's statement was slightly inaccurate. As I recall, we were due to have a vote at 6.25 pm, but we finished at 6.10 pm—15 minutes early rather than 37 minutes early: a slight difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
We have made it consistently clear from the outset that eight sittings would not be enough, given the amount of new material that the Government are inserting into the Bill and the number of issues that remain from our deliberations in January. I said so on 9 June, as I mentioned this morning when the motion was debated, and at the beginning of this sitting, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) said the same in subsequent business questions. I am glad that the Government, having steadfastly refused to consider any of our amendments in January, have now made some concessions in relation to one or two matters. I hope that they will make some more this afternoon. Indeed, I eagerly anticipate that they will as that would be a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters need to be fully negotiated. I accept the Minister's assertion that 35 per cent.—six hours—of the Committee's time has been spent on Government matters and that 65 per cent.—11 hours—has been spent on Opposition and other matters relating to Government new clauses and amendments. It is quite proper that a planning Bill that touches so many constituency cases should allow adequate time not only for Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen but for Back Benchers, who have initiated some extremely useful debates and new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), who found a consensus of opinion among Government Back Benchers in some of the debates that he initiated. Some of the Committee's time has therefore been very usefully spent, given the importance of any debate on planning. I do not know how many letters other Members receive from constituents about planning, but probably nearly half my constituency correspondence is about planning one way or another. I admit that I live in the Cotswolds in a very sensitive planning area, but it is unsurprising that colleagues want to raise such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the time allowed has been prolonged, for which I am very grateful to the Government. As the Minister says, an extra sitting gives us an extra day, but I still do not believe that nine sittings are enough. As I said at the outset, 12 would have been about right. I hope that we will have adequate time on Report to deal with the outstanding matters. The Government tell us that the Report stage will be held after the Queen's Speech, and I hope that we will not be severely timetabled to an hour or two. We need to discuss that through the usual channels. I give the Minister notice that I believe that we need at least a complete day on the Floor of the House on Report, or possibly longer. I need to reflect on that. Then, of course, it will go to the other place. It is important that these matters are debated properly. People outside will not understand that whole chunks of the Bill are undebated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the subject of timetabling. This morning, Mr. Hurst, your co-Chairman said that the Modernisation Committee was considering the matter. Several points need to be made about timetabling. First, I do not like it. I would have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
more than happy to agree to have no timetable, as the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) and I did when we were the usual channels for the Committee considering the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill. That Committee lasted for six weeks, and we finished exactly on the day on which I had given an undertaking to the Government usual channels that we would. That is a far better way of working because things can go wrong in Committee—as we found under the straitjacket of the motion that was passed in the House this morning—and it makes much more sense than going on until 7.30 pm, thus inconveniencing every Member. I do not mind. I would have been happy to go on until midnight, as the Minister offered, although he then retracted that. It does not make any difference to me, but that is not a clever way of working. We would have been much better off doing that, but we could not do that under the terms of the timetable agreed by the House. The Standing Orders need to be more flexible so that we can discuss such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those few remarks, I reiterate to the Government that not enough time was allowed for this Bill. However, we are grateful for the Government's flexibility, and we will do our best to proceed expeditiously and see how much we can get through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right from the start, our position on the matter has been to give the Government their head in terms of making decisions about timetabling. We have always had concerns about the amount of time available, which we raised from the start. Clearly, we would not have finished everything, even if we had gone on until midnight, as the Minister offered. I felt duty bound to accept that offer. Unfortunately, it was clear that some of his colleagues probably wished that he had not said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Turner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So does he.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Inspiration winged its way—not from his usual sources, but from those behind him. I felt duty bound to accept the midnight offer, but see that we will now finish at 7.30 pm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government ought to be credited with the fact that they have been flexible in changing the order of consideration so that we can discuss certain amendments, including a Government amendment to clause 40, which will make a substantive change to the planning system. If the Committee had not got to that, we would not have done the Bill, or practitioners, a service. With that, and the fact that I would have liked to continue until midnight, I will leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>2.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Seven of the amendments have been tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), and two have been tabled by the Conservative Front Bench. Amendment No. 126 would remove the need for the regional planning body to give notice to the Secretary of State of its intention to prepare a draft revision. I just have a simple question: why should it have to do that—particularly if ministerial instructions oblige it to do so regularly? In debating the previous amendment, the Minister said that regulations would allow a Minister to dictate the period of time in which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
revisions should take place. In that case, why is a formal process necessary, under which the regional planning body must tell the Minister that it is about to begin the work? That seems an unnecessary bureaucratic burden, and I am sure that the Minister is keen to remove bureaucracy in the planning system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 127 would ensure that certain local authorities would have to assist the regional planning body in preparing a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy. That is to ensure dialogue between all the relevant authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 128 would ensure that in preparing the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy the regional planning body must have regard to, first,
	<br><q><p>"the need to integrate considerations of land-use planning, transport and sustainable resource management"</p></q>
and, secondly,
	<br><q><p>"placing protection of the environment as the over-arching principal consideration of the RSS".</p></q>
We tabled it to try to introduce the concept of sustainability into the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy. I know what the Minister is going to tell me about that. He will say that there is no need for an amendment, because next week the Government will publish the planning policy statement on sustainability, and the issue will be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Rooney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is tomorrow. Inspiration has winged its way to me from the Labour Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know what the Minister will say, but the amendment was tabled because we had no indication of what the Government's definitions of sustainability would be, or how they would be produced. We now know the answer, and I repeat that it would have been helpful to have the relevant information in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 129 is intended to ensure that when it is preparing the draft revision the regional planning body must have regard to
	<br><q><p>"the views of the authorities in section 4(2)"—</p></q>
which are a county council, a metropolitan district council, a district council for an area with no county council, or a national park authority. That is meant to ensure cross-authority dialogue and consultation, which I am sure the Minister would want. I am concerned about what may happen if that is not made explicit. Regional planning bodies may choose not to follow guidance, whereas they would have no choice about complying with a provision in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 131 would ensure publication, not just preparation, of
	<br><q><p>"a report of the findings of the appraisal"</p></q>
under clause 5(4)(b). The appraisal in question would relate to the sustainability of the proposals in the draft. There is currently no requirement for publication. I should have thought, what with open government and all that, that the Minister would be falling over himself to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 134 would ensure full public consultation on the draft revision of the regional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1003">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
spatial strategy. Not only would it ensure that the public would be consulted, but it would also mean that the regional planning body would have to produce a second draft incorporating any ideas from the consultation that it deemed important. The amendment is in a sense an attempt to make sure that real consultation, not sham consultation, is what takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 10 years ago in Shropshire county council—it could have been anywhere—a Labour councillor who had better remain nameless asked in an open meeting, "How can we consult? We haven't decided what we're going to do yet." I am sure that he has come a long way since. The intention behind the provisions is not to allow those attitudes to fall into place regionally. Again, I am sure that the Minister would be only too happy to ensure that such consultation is genuine consultation, and not just an attempt to window-dress for the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 135, which is my final amendment in the group, would mean that the regional planning body would not have to submit the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy to the Secretary of State. Under amendment No. 134, the draft revision would have to be submitted
	<br><q><p>"to the Regional elected Assembly, or if one is not present, the Secretary of State."</p></q>
Why should the Secretary of State have primacy over the elected regional Assembly where one exists? Where democratic accountability is built in, we would surely expect the draft revision to go to the regional Assembly rather than to the Secretary of State. After all, the Welsh and Scottish spatial plans would not come to London and be presented to the Minister. Rather, they rest with the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. I may be wrong, but I do not expect to see the Minister sitting and working through the details of the Welsh spatial strategy. In that case, why does the draft revision need to go to the Secretary of State where there are elected regional Assemblies? Why can it not rest with the elected regional authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my seven amendments, and I shall let the Conservatives speak to theirs, both of which we broadly support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like first to address the Committee on amendments No. 199 and 200. Amendment No. 199 says:
	<br><q><p>"Before preparing a draft revision of the RSS the RPB must set out proposals to ensure appropriate public consultation on the contents of the RSS in accordance with such guidance as is specified by the Secretary of State."</p></q>
That is a long-winded way of saying that there should be proper public consultation in the Bill. We have at huge length dealt with part 2 of the Bill on making local plans, and are now on part 1, which deals with regional aspects, on which it would be thoroughly desirable to have complete public consultation as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier in our proceedings that he did not feel that many outside individuals would want to take part in that consultation, except for one or two specialist lobbying organisations. I think and hope
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
that he is wrong in that assessment. Some of my more articulate constituents, who write to me regularly and often about planning, will want to take part in the process, so we must take amendment No. 199 seriously and make the process easy and accessible to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before discussing the role of county councils in relation to amendment No. 129, I should like to turn to amendment No. 200, which says in paragraph (g) that in preparing the regional spatial strategy, regard must be had for
	<br><q><p>"the Minerals and Waste Strategies prepared by County Councils within its region,"</p></q>
and
	<br><q><p>"such other matters as are prescribed."</p></q>
I do not know how it would be possible to draw up a proper regional spatial strategy without considering the minerals and waste strategies prepared by county councils. That issue impinges on so many other things that it would have to be considered. Other matters like minerals and waste strategies will also need to be considered. If the Minister is not minded to accept amendment No. 200, he will need to explain carefully how that will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to come back to Liberal Democrat amendment No. 129, and discuss the view of authorities in section 4(2). As one might expect, we have had a number of representations from county councils. A particularly good one was sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) by his county council, Essex county council. It is worth putting on the record what it says are the issues that define statutory roles for county councils in drawing up the RSS. It says:
	<br><q><p>"It is important for all local authorities to have a statutory stake in the RSS process, as it will impinge on strategic and local levels and will need their commitment."</p></q>
Of course that will need their commitment.
	<br><q><p>"Given the lack of other formal engagement in the new planning system, it will be particularly important for county councils to have a statutory role in helping to prepare the RSS. The Bill proposes that the role of county councils will be to advise district authorities on the preparation of Local Development Frameworks (LDFs) (if asked) and provide technical advice to the regional planning body and assist on the sub-regional aspects of the Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) (again, if asked). This role is not statutory.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Failure to establish a statutory planning duty for county councils will inevitably erode the strategic planning function. It will lead to a reduction in funding for strategic planning and the subsequent loss of strategic planning skills, which will be to the detriment of both the RSS and the LDF."</p></q>
I made that point this morning when we were discussing chief planning officers. I have a real fear as a constituency Member of Parliament and as a professional that if we do not deal with the transitional arrangements carefully, there will be a severe haemorrhaging of experienced planning officers from county councils. The Government will need to address that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representations continue:
	<br><q><p>"In many parts of the country, county councils have traditionally provided the bulk of the expertise and monitoring to underpin both regional planning guidance and local plans. Monitoring and policy capability does not currently exist at regional or local levels".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
Even more importantly, if that does not exist at regional levels and county councils are haemorrhaging staff, we could find ourselves with a gap in expertise, at least for a time.
	<br><q><p>"The government has indicated that from next year, money currently going to county councils will go direct to Regional Planning Bodies."</p></q>
That is exactly what I have been saying throughout the Committee. The money is all going to set up those regional planning bodies—on expensive buildings, new staff, probably expensive buildings in Brussels, and everything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document continues by stating that the way in which
	<br><q><p>"county councils are expected to continue to provide input with less money and an intermittent, insecure and voluntary role, at the request of their partners, is not explained. At best, county council resources in these areas will slowly wither away. Political commitment will inevitably decline for what will have become an ancillary activity and not a core function.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>However, the government acknowledges the importance of county councils. Is this a case of a desire to have legislative clarity, vis-à-vis outcomes on elected regional assemblies, outweighing a desire to enact legislation that will actually deliver on the ground?"</p></q>
We need to consider that matter carefully, and consider how the transition will take place vis-à-vis county councils and vis-à-vis drawing up the plans. I already cited the Government's desire that the local development scheme should be in operation by the end of next year, and the actual plan documents by 2007. That is an ambitious target. It is going to need every bit of good will from every authority. If we do not put such matters in the Bill, or at least have clarity in Government guidance, I do not know how we will achieve what the Government have set out to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Hurst and know how much you are looking forward to the somewhat longer sitting that beckons. I welcome also the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), the other voice of the land of paradise in our Committee. It is a delight to see him in his place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a large group of amendments and it covers a lot of ground on the new regional planning arrangements. Perhaps I might begin by indicating to the Committee my understanding of the purport of the amendments, so that we are absolutely clear about the ground on which we stand. Amendment No. 126 would remove the requirement for the regional planning body to give notice to the Secretary of State of its intention to prepare a draft revision—an RSS. I will, with the indulgence of the Committee, move to those initials so beloved of the hon. Member for Rayleigh, and regional spatial strategies henceforward will be RSSs in Hill-speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 127 would require for their own areas county councillors, unitary authorities and national park authorities to help the RPB, aka the regional planning body, to prepare draft revisions of the RSS. Amendment No. 199 would require the RPB to set out, before it began to prepare a draft revision of the RSS, proposals to secure public consultation on the contents of the revision in line with guidance from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 128 would explicitly require the RPB to consider the need to integrate transport, land use planning and the sustainable management of resources and place the protection of the environment as the overarching principle when preparing a draft revision of the RSS. Amendment No. 129 would require the RPB to have regard to the views of county councils, unitary authorities and national park authorities in preparing a draft revision to the RSS. Amendment No. 200 would specify the regional economic strategy and county mineral waste strategies as matters to which the RPB must have regard when preparing a draft revision of the RSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 131 would require an RPB to publish the report of the sustainability appraisal of a draft revision, and amendments Nos. 134 and 135 are intended to provide for the RPB to prepare and consult on a draft revision of the RSS twice before submitting the second draft of that revision to the elected regional assembly or, if there is not one, to the Secretary of State. So far, so good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal first with the amendments concerning the role of county councils and other types of authority with an expertise in strategic planning in the regional planning arrangements in part 1 of the Bill. We have just published for consultation the draft regulations and guidance on regional and local planning under the Bill. I am sure that you, Mr. Hurst, have had time to digest their contents, but I should like to take the opportunity to set out in detail the role of the authorities in the new regional planning system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authorities will have a critical strategic role in the new regional planning arrangements for involvement and partnership working. The provision for that role is not only in the Bill but also in regulations and guidance. I stress that it is only from those authorities that the RPBs must consider whether assistance is desirable and, if so, try to arrange it. This is not about officers from those authorities working to an RPB brief. If an RPB enters an arrangement with a county council, for example, it will be an agreement between the council and the RPB. They will work together and county officers will report to their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations will ensure that these also have a significant input to draft RSS revisions. RPBs will have to consult them up front before finalising proposals to put to the Secretary of State. Thereafter, those authorities will be kept informed and consulted at each stage. The RPB will also have to prepare a statement on whom it has consulted, what they said and how it is taking that into account. That will also reinforce the need for the RPB to have properly involved those authorities in preparing a draft revision of the RSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final element of the package that defines the role of those authorities is guidance. Draft PPS11 makes it clear that the RPB should be particularly careful to ensure that it works on a partnership basis with the authorities to ensure strategy buy-in. The PPS
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1005">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
draws particular attention to the role of counties and unitary councils in assisting the RPB in developing the policy and, subsequently, implementing it through their service responsibilities—education and transport, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
PPS11 states that that should be a two-way process in that priorities in those service areas should help to shape the RSS revision. PPS11 also states that the counties will have a particularly important role in sub-regional studies, both as participants and, often, as leaders, working to an agreed brief drawn up by the RPB in conjunction with them and other interested planning authorities and stakeholders. The guidance also makes it clear that the Government expect RPBs and those authorities entering arrangements to work together in all regions. For example, the authorities might provide technical expertise, help or lead work on sub-regional elements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered this at some length, but I have done so in order to demonstrate that we fully expect counties and these other councils to help the RPB prepare draft revisions to RSSs. RPBs will seek and take account of these authorities' views when preparing draft revisions and, doubtless, in their wider work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Perhaps he was coming to this matter, but I should be grateful if he would explain how, if he is going to take the money away from county councils and give it to the regions, the counties will have the resources to carry out that strategic function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not as if, I might say, the counties are going to be entirely stripped of all kinds of funding. There will be funding available in relation to their continuing strategic functions. The picture of a kind of stripping out of the county level and its funnelling into the financial milch cow of the regional chambers is somewhat exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments that we are debating. Amendment No. 127 is not acceptable because a duty for those councils to help the RPB would not work in practice. It is not, for example, sensible to compel a county council to help an RPB when it is not willing to do so voluntarily. An involuntary working relationship risks problems and delays, with disputes about who is responsible for what. That is why clause 4 is framed as it is. The RPB must be willing, the county must be willing and they must arrange together what the county is to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 129 is about the RPB taking account of the views of those authorities. I have already explained how regulations and guidance will achieve that. Amendment 129 is not therefore necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments about consultation on draft revisions to RSS. Community involvement—it needs to be involvement not simply consultation—should be central to the process. The issue is how best that will actually be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly sensible, as amendment 199 proposes, for the RPB to set out its proposals for consultation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
and for the Secretary of State to give guidance on that. That is what will happen. Draft PPS11 requires that, as part of the project plan, the RPB sets out how it proposes to involve the community from the beginning to the end of the revision process. We expect community involvement to be project managed in the same way as the rest of the RSS revision process of which it is an integral part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be helpful for the few Committee members who have not had time to digest the package of draft regulations and guidance that was circulated on 14 October if I remind them of the main elements of the comprehensive arrangements for community involvement that we have set out in the draft regulations and in PPS11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional planning body is required by the draft regulations to consult a number of specific and representative bodies in drawing up the draft RSS. At the same time, it is required to send the Secretary of State a statement setting out who has been consulted and how, the main issues raised and how they have been addressed in the draft revision. It is also required to send copies of the draft RSS and supporting documents to all those whom the RPB thinks may have an interest or who have made representations, and to make copies of the draft RSS and supporting documents available around the region and on the web.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both in the main body of the text and in an annex on community involvement, PPS11 details what the RPB should and could do to involve the community. I give a couple of examples. The RPB must hold a one-day public conference to seek agreement that the issues identified for the revision are the right ones. Secondly, the RPB must consider establishing a group, chaired and comprised of people from outside the RPB and the local authorities, that should be consulted at milestones, as the draft RSS emerges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To require the publication of a first and a second draft, as suggested in amendments Nos. 134 and 135 would be too prescriptive. The RPB may wish to do that, but it should be the planning body's decision. It should be based on the circumstances of the revision, and have regard to the need to stick to the timetable set out in PPS11, of twelve months between an agreed project plan and the submission of the draft revision to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said so often, we want involvement to be front-loaded as much as possible. The stage when the community's input will make most difference is often while the formal document is emerging, not once the draft has been published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's remarks about involvement being front-loaded. Will he expand his guidance to give local authorities every encouragement to hold planning meetings at a time when people who work, those who have responsibility for child care or the care of the elderly, and people who have difficulty accessing public transport, will be able to attend? It is no good such meetings taking place in county hall on a Wednesday afternoon, when many people are working.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for yet another eminently relevant and sensible contribution. I assure him that we will certainly take those suggestions on board when we finalise our draft guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just lumped together amendments Nos. 134 and 135, and said that they would mean having to publish two drafts, and that they would be too prescriptive. He completely glossed over the issue of whether, if there is an elected regional assembly, the RPB should have to submit a statement to the Secretary of State, as set out in the Bill. He may be right that the amendments are too prescriptive in other ways, but together they would mean that a regional elected assembly would not have to submit a statement to the Secretary of State. That is, the amendments would treat regional assemblies the same as Wales and Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me say it again—I think that I have said it before, but it is fundamental to our understanding of regional spatial strategies. When we have elected regional authorities, the strategies will be devised by the elected authority, and they will be the property of the authority. It must be remembered that, until that time, regional spatial strategies are the property of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the Bill does not say that. Clause 5(6) states:
	<br><q><p>"When the RPB"—</p></q>
it will be called an RPB whether or not it is an elected body—
	<br><q><p>"has prepared a draft revision … it must—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) submit them to the Secretary of State."</p></q>
It does not say that when there is an elected regional assembly in the region where the RPB is, it does not have to submit them to the Secretary of State. It is implicit that the Secretary of State will still have the power to say yes or no to a regional spatial strategy that has been approved by an elected regional assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Aha! The hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. We shall amend the Bill under the elected regional assemblies legislation. That will resolve the hon. Gentleman's anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Ludlow on having spotted that, and having achieved the first acceptance of an amendment in this Committee—albeit this Minister, unlike his predecessor, rejects them with a smile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight said. There will be a problem with regard to community involvement in large regions, such as the south-east and the southwest. For example, the south-west stretches from Tewkesbury in the north to the Isles of Scilly in the south. It is a vast region. May I make a practical suggestion? Might the regions consider holding sub-regional road shows so that people in local areas can understand what their region is proposing in its regional spatial strategy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely good idea and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That should be fed back into, if not guidance, the ethos, culture and messages that we shall want to convey as we elaborate the process of community involvement under the regional spatial strategy framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we come to the amendments that concern the regional spatial strategy, what it should contain and the principles and documents to which the regional planning body should have regard in preparing revisions. I entirely agree with the sentiment expressed in Amendment No. 128 about the need for the RSS to integrate land use planning, transport and sustainable resource management considerations. Including that in the Bill, however, raises difficult questions about what we mean by those terms in a way that will stand up legally. For example, how would the parties opposite define, in legal terms, what sustainable resource management means? I pause, and no offers are forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the regional transport strategy is a part of the RSS and there is a requirement for a sustainability appraisal on the draft revision of the RSS provide assurance that transport and sustainability issues will be looked at in an integrated way within the RSS revision process. The consultation draft of PPS11 stresses the need for the RSS to provide a development strategy that provides priorities for the environment and transport among other topic areas. Guidance is the best way of achieving the integration of those matters that we are all looking for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second aspect of amendment No. 128, I am concerned that setting protection of the environment as the overarching principal consideration of the RSS serves to unbalance its purpose. The policies in the RSS should help to deliver sustainable communities for the future. It will be necessary to weigh up social and economic considerations as well as environmental ones, without giving precedence to any one in particular. There is no chance that environmental considerations will be ignored. As well as the sustainability appraisal on the draft RSS required by the Bill, there will also—as we discussed, debated and agreed before—be the strategic environment assessment directive. That will require revisions of the draft RSS to be subject to an assessment of its effects on the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 200 would add the regional economic strategy in each region and the minerals and waste strategies prepared by county councils to the list of matters that the RPB must have regard to when preparing a draft revision to an RSS. The hon. Member for Cotswold drew attention to that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that it is better to leave the matter to regulation and guidance, which will provide us with the flexibility that may be necessary if circumstances change. Draft regulation 8 requires the regional planning body to have regard to the regional economic strategy in the region when the draft revision of the RSS is being prepared. PPS11 emphasises the essential importance of the RSS and regional economic strategy complementing and reinforcing one another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1007">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
The reason why we should not include the county mineral and waste strategies is simple. There will be a significant number of partial RSS revisions that will not be concerned with mineral or waste matters. It would not be sensible to require the regional planning body to have regard to county mineral and waste strategies for completely unrelated revisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the amendments would not change what the draft revision to the RSS looks like, so they are unnecessary. That brings me to the remaining amendments in the group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Francois 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rayleigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before the Minister moves off the group, may I make one point? The Minister has this afternoon appeared to draw a distinction between involvement and simple consultation. He has implied that involvement is a much more active process, in which people have a much larger input than they do in consultation, in which they are shown something and asked to comment on it. Can he confirm that it is the Government's intention for county councils to be actively involved in the drawing up of regional spatial strategies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold has pointed out, the Government have an ambitious timetable for making the process work. If they are going to do that, realistically, it will not work unless county councils are brought within the tent. Will the Minister then say something to reassure county councillors and their planning staff that they will be actively involved in the drawing up of RSSs, as opposed to being just consultees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, county councils are statutory consultees under the terms of the Bill. The answer to his question about active involvement is that I would expect to see such active involvement where the counties wish to be so engaged. I hope that that satisfies him and is a positive message to the counties—I am aware of some misgivings on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the remaining amendments in the group. I cannot agree with amendment No. 126, which would mean that the regional planning body would not have to tell the Secretary of State that it intended to prepare a draft revision of the RSS. As I said, the RSS is the Secretary of State's policy and it is only right that the RPB should give him notice of when it intends to draft revisions to his policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's response to my intervention in relation to amendment No. 135, can I take it that when there are elected regional assemblies, the new Bill to give powers to the regional assemblies will also remove the requirement on them to tell the Secretary of State every time they are going to make a draft revision to an RSS that belongs to the assembly, not the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
Amendment No. 131 is not necessary. I entirely agree that the regional planning body should publish the report of its sustainability appraisal of a draft revision of an RSS. That is required in the draft regulations on part 1 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the explanations that I have attempted to offer on this large and diverse group of amendments, I sincerely trust that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much encouraged by the Minister's responses. For perhaps the first time, we have almost seen the acceptance of an amendment, even if it is going to be in a future Bill, which I suppose is half a loaf, if not the whole loaf. Also, I am reassured that when we do have elected regional assemblies, the Secretary of State will divest his powers to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have long argued that if elected regional assemblies are to work and to prove popular, and if we are to win the referendums due to be held next autumn, we need to make it absolutely clear that they will have real powers. Most, if not all, of those powers should be devolved to them from Westminster rather than sucked up from local councils. Otherwise, the public will not want them and will not support them. This is the first indication today that a few more powers than were originally published might be handed down to the regions, although I understand that there were difficulties at the time in getting all the Ministers to agree which powers they were handing down. Clearly, this Minister is a much more devolving Minister who is happy to give power away. That is a very welcome step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's explanation that my other amendments are unnecessary thanks to guidance that has already been published or that is about to be published. In the case of guidance that has already been published, however, I must point out that we have to table our amendments at least two days in advance of a sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept the Minister's point that amendment No. 134 could have the perverse effect of creating unnecessary bureaucracy. I am also grateful for the tone that the Minister has adopted in relation to the amendments and for the first signs of a Minister prepared to let go.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
to the previous debate to be appropriate in response to this one. I tabled the amendment because I believed that there was a particular need for regional planning bodies to have regard to the interests of rural areas in considering their regional spatial strategy revision, as most of those regional bodies, if not all of them, will be dominated substantially by urban dwellers, and some rural areas need to be protected not only for the benefit of people who live there and those who visit there, but for the country as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 338 would require the RPB to have regard to the local authority's landscape character assessment, which is defined in amendment No. 342, and to have regard to
	<br><q><p>"the need to protect and enhance rural tranquillity".</p></q>
What evidence do I have for my concern that insufficient account may be taken of the needs of rural areas? First, most of the regions that the Government have designated are built around very large conurbations, with the exception of those south of the line from the Wash to the Severn. Each region centres on a conurbation with a substantial urban population of more than 1 million, whether it is Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds or Newcastle, the south-east or the eastern region, but not the southwest, where the reverse is true. The further a region is from urban areas, the less account is generally taken of its needs. I illustrate that by referring to a consultation document on airport strategy, which the Minister's colleague has just published. That document was so knowledgeable about the regions of England, and particularly rural areas, that the map that went with it placed the Isle of Wight somewhere off Portland Bill. Not only is that the wrong place, as the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) knows, but it is not even in the right region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that such ignorance may not be confined to the Department for Transport. It may be present in some regional planning bodies. It is proposed that, should regional governance reach the south-east, the region would have something like 38 representatives. My constituency would share a representative with two constituencies in Portsmouth, two in Southampton and two or three across the southern part of Hampshire. There would be very little input, proportionately, for rural areas. I believe that rural areas need to be protected, and the amendment would deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to an earlier debate, to which I hope I can refer without being out of order, Mr. Hurst, the Minister suggested that PPS11 would contain a wealth of useful detail on what the regional planning body should take into account. I therefore thumbed through to find out where rural tranquillity was referred to in draft PPS11. Although I did not read every word, I could not find any reference to rural tranquillity or to landscape character assessments. Even when I turned to annexe A, the annotated bibliography of topic-specific policy, in which I expected those topics to be recorded, perhaps in alphabetical order, or perhaps thematically, I came across a page with nothing on it except the heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
The Minister needs to add some information to annexe A, if he would not mind. It is at page 29, for the information of the Committee, that he states that the relevant information will be available in the final version of the PPS. Will he confirm that, in the final version, the annotated bibliography will contain reference to landscape character assessments and other documents? Otherwise, I will need a very good reason to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us remind ourselves that the amendment would require regional planning bodies to have regard to local authorities' landscape character assessments carried out in accordance with guidance issued by the Countryside Agency, and to the need to protect and enhance rural tranquillity when preparing a draft revision of their regional spatial strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight can anticipate that I shall not necessarily immediately embrace his amendment. However, the Committee has certainly appreciated the important issues that he has raised in a series of amendments—in particular the amendment on the subject of master planning, which was ably moved in his absence by his hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir Sydney Chapman). I found it most thought-provoking, even if I had to reject it, just as I must reject the amendment before the Committee. I do not believe that the amendment would bring about the right approach to the issues. They should properly be considered in the context of reviews of national planning policies and advice, and they do not need to be specified in primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made something of the lack of relevant references in the famous draft PPS11. However, he is looking in the wrong place. The right place is PPS7 on planning policy on sustainable development in rural areas. That is already out for consultation and the final version will certainly cover rural topics in relation to the regional spatial strategy. Indeed, the consultation now being undertaken on the draft of new planning policy statement 7 provides the opportunity for those issues to be considered, along with other planning policies for sustainable development in rural areas and the protection of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the need to have regard to local authorities' landscape character assessments or the need to protect and enhance rural tranquillity were to be identified as national planning policies in the final published versions of planning policy statements, clause 5(3)(a) would place the necessary requirement on regional planning bodies to have regard to those policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Isle of Wight raised a rather pertinent point when speaking about draft PPS11.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would I be right in saying that the hon. Gentleman is trying to say that the amendment seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State can give a direction recognising the body as the regional planning body only when it satisfies such criteria as are prescribed? At present, it is not a stipulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. He has explained amendment No. 271 better than I can, so I move quickly on to the next amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 272 would provide that the regional authority may carry out those functions only if a referendum has been held. This is an important clause. We believe that regional planning bodies should not be created until a referendum has been held and voted for in the affirmative. It is a question of democratic accountability. Regional bodies are almost exclusively made up of indirectly elected members. No one knows who they are. They are not accountable to anyone, or are only slightly accountable. The granting of such huge powers to largely unaccountable people is a democratic deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hark back to our previous debates on whether the regional spatial strategy is the Secretary of State's policy until there is an elected regional assembly. I hope that we never have elected regional assemblies. If
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
we do, the whole democratic position will change. Until then, we have a democratic problem: the Government are rushing ahead with the regional planning agenda, in which we do not believe. They should carefully consider the democratic legitimacy of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I have already spoken to amendment No. 171, so I will move on to the amendment tabled in my name and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 117 would leave out subsection (3), which states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may give a direction withdrawing recognition of"</p></q>
a regional planning body. It is not so much that I want to take that power away, as that I want the Minister to explain under what circumstances the Secretary of State might withdraw recognition of a regional planning body and what the consequences would be if the Secretary of State assumed the functions of that body. That is probably how it would work. That provision is particularly draconian, and I assume that the Minister will say that he hopes that it will never have to be used, and that he would not go anywhere near it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know—I am sure that local planning bodies would like to know—under what sort of circumstances the Secretary of State would withdraw recognition, and how the system would then function. If regional spatial strategies were operating across the country and one regional planning body were to have its recognition withdrawn, there would be a great hole in the planning structure, which would have to be filled by the Secretary of State. I am sure that the Secretary of State could cope with the minutiae that I am sure will exist in every RSS in the country, but he may struggle to find the time to do so. What arrangements will there be to deal with such circumstances? Amendment No. 117 is a probing amendment. It is for the Minister to explain how, why and what would happen in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to add my strong support to the principle of amendment No. 272, although I suspect that it is not the way to solve the problem because the drafting would have slightly odd consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will take some powers away from county councils, but not all of them: they will be left with waste and minerals. Those powers are currently administered by elected county councillors, but will pass to RPBs. By next autumn, we may have some referendums, which will hopefully result in yes votes in the three northern regions. It is conceivable that six months to a year later, we will have functioning elected regional assemblies in those regions. Short of an earthquake, the Government are not going to win referendums in the south-east, the south-west or, I suspect, most of the midlands, given their regional boundaries. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be elected regional assemblies, certainly in the south-east, in the foreseeable future. I regret that, as I would like us to have regional assemblies. The boundaries are wrong and should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
We will have a period of five or 10 years, in which powers will have been taken from elected councillors and given to an unelected body, an RPB. We will have a quasi-elected regional body—not even that; it will have people on it who have been elected to other bodies—councillors roughly in proportion to the political strength in the region—but that is not really the same. The regional planning bodies will not be accountable in such circumstances. They are accountable to the Secretary of State. Essentially, until there are elected regional assemblies, this represents a centralising of power.—Ultimately, power rests with the Secretary of State. That is of deep concern to anybody who is a democrat or a proponent of the devolution of power, as I am sure that the Minister is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for a considerable period, probably at least five years, there will be no devolution of power. Amendment No. 272 seeks—probably in an imperfect way—to ensure that the powers are not taken from the county councils and that the regional planning body is not set up until there is a regional elected assembly. Until then, we would continue to have the current structure. There is planning at a regional level—the Government office does some—but the power still rests with the county councils. I realise that that will cause the Government problems, because there will be different speeds in different parts of the country. However, that is a consequence of devolution, something that both my party and the Minister's agree is a way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we already have different speeds in different parts of the country and that we already have different arrangements for London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We are in a multi-speed situation in terms of devolution and I see no reason why we cannot be multi-speed in terms of the rearrangement of the planning system. Once there are elected bodies—we heard under the previous clause that the powers will be taken away from the Secretary of State when there are elected regional bodies—there will be some devolution of power. The Secretary of State will no longer have the control over planning that he has at the moment in that he could call in the plan of any level of body and exert control over it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will, if he does not accept the amendment—I would be stunned if he did—at least take good heed that there is an electoral problem for the Government. This is, potentially, the most controversial aspect of the Bill—the taking of powers from elected bodies and handing them to unelected bodies. I am fairly certain that that is something that the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, and probably many Labour peers and Cross Benchers in the Lords will have an interesting time agreeing on. I suspect that the Minister will need to find a way of accommodating our concerns. If a line is to be drawn in the sand on this Bill, this is probably where it is. If the Minister does not accept amendments here or on Report, this is probably the issue that will cause us to continue to vote against the Bill, as we did on Second
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
Reading. We accept that there is much in it that would improve the planning system, but to take powers away from elected people and hand them to unelected people is a step too far. We cannot find that acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Conservatives have tabled the amendment, even though I do not think that it is the way to deal with the problem, as it has allowed us to raise the issue and to deal with a serious democratic deficit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the amendments because, as the hon. Member for Ludlow has pointed out, they sharply illustrate the key problem, which is that local authorities are going to lose powers either to a nominee or a group of nominees of the Secretary of State, or to the Secretary of State himself. Neither the nominees nor, to a lesser extent, the Secretary of State, will have any democratic accountability within the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group of nominees that has been appointed to the regional planning body for the south-east of England, fortuitously, includes a member of the local authority in my constituency. His name is Harry Rees and he is the economic development portfolio holder. Until he retired recently, he ran a successful tea shop in Shanklin, so he is eminently qualified for such an illustrious position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely responding to the question in my normal, courteous fashion. However, I shall take your advice, Mr. Hurst. He, at least, has the advantage, in terms of representing the Isle of Wight, of being a resident of it. The Secretary of State is not a resident of the Isle of Wight and most of the appointees to the planning body are not residents of the Isle of Wight. The Secretary of State is not even a resident of the south-east of England. He is a resident of Hull, of Clapham, and of Admiralty arch. He is, for one day a month, according to a recent article in the 	<i>Evening Standard,</i> a resident of Dorneywood. However, although that is technically in the southeast of England, it is so metropolitan that it hardly counts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only concern about my hon. Friend's amendment is that if the Secretary of State does not designate one of the bodies, then the Secretary of State will be the regional planning body for the south-east—or, indeed, any other area. While there is very little of advantage in a regional planning body that is designated by the Secretary of State—a series of place men appointed by the Secretary of State—there is even less advantage in the Secretary of State himself acting as the regional planning body. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that limited criticism. I shall, of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
course, support his amendment, but I hope to have the opportunity to vote against the clause on stand part. One problem with the regional bodies is that they represent no known geographical area. There is no such place as the south-east of England. There might be such a place as Yorkshire—of course there is—but there is no such place as Yorkshire and Humber. There is no such place as the south-west of England. Any hon. Member who represents a Cornish constituency would concede that, at least going by the boundaries designated by the Secretary of State. There is, of course, a region known as East Anglia, and I shall not argue too much about its boundaries, although my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh might have a different view from mine. However, the idea of regions is alien to the traditions of most people in the area broadly south of a line from the Wash to the Severn. For that reason, among others, I reject the idea of regional planning bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a proponent of regional government, I share many of the hon. Gentleman's reservations about the current boundaries. The Government made a big mistake in accepting boundaries that were established by a Conservative Government for an entirely different reason—for administrative purposes. I believe that it is possible to redraw the regional boundaries so that they can be accepted by the public and can perform a useful function. If the regions were such that they made sense to the people—such as the Marches region in my area, with which people identify—would many of his reservations disappear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of my reservations would certainly disappear. The idea of sharing power over one's life is entirely acceptable to those with a commonality of interest. However, it would be difficult for my constituents who live in Ventnor or Freshwater to identify a commonality of interest with people in Guildford or Milton Keynes. I am sure that it would be equally difficult for the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) to identify a commonality of interest with the constituents of St. Ives and South-East Cornwall.

The point of discussing the boundaries encompassed by regional government is whether it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to have power over a region, or to designate that power to someone or something else. That is why I drew attention to the different demands of various parts of the country. I can see that I am trespassing on the Committee's time, and that they might want to deal with more than the first three clauses before 7.15 pm. I am pleased to support the amendments, but I think that we might have a debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was magnetised by the hon. Gentleman's rhetoric and could not wait for him to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will endeavour to reply to this interesting and wide-ranging debate. To begin, I would like to identify the purpose of amendments Nos. 271 and 272. Their effect would be to alter clause 2 to allow the Secretary of State to designate a body as a regional planning body only if there had been a positive vote in a referendum for an elected regional assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some opponents of the arrangements in the Bill take the line that there should be no planning reforms in England. Instead, they believe that the new arrangements should apply only in areas where elected regional assemblies are to be established, if and when they are. As drafted, the amendments appear to go even further, implying that there should no regional planning bodies until such time as the regions have voted in favour of an elected regional assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would make the Secretary of State responsible for preparing all revisions to regional spatial strategies and for exercising the functions of the regional planning board generally as he thinks appropriate. Amendment No. 117 would remove the Secretary of State's power under clause 2 (3) to withdraw recognition of a body as the regional planning body. The amendments raise two key issues—first, the need for reforms to regional planning and, secondly, whether changes should be made only if a region has voted in favour of an elected regional assembly in a referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contend that we need effective planning at regional level. The Government believe, as did their Conservative predecessors, that regional planning is essential. Without it, we cannot sensibly address the many planning problems that cut across administrative boundaries, or properly co-ordinate transport and other investment decisions to ensure that we get the right strategic balance. Decisions about correcting major imbalances between growth and decline in a region cannot be taken at a lower level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A practical example is the 1996 regional planning guidance 13 for the north-west, issued under the Conservative Government. That was a good illustration of why regional planning is necessary. One of its objectives, which we supported and which was right at the time, was to secure a modest shift in emphasis to the principle transport axes running north to south—the west coast main line and the M6 motorway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the regional planning system needs to be improved. It needs to be more responsive to regional circumstances and priorities, and better able to tackle strategic planning problems where they occur. Frankly, it needs more teeth. For those reasons, regional spatial strategies should be statutory, and so part of the development plan. We should not continue with a system where outdated lower-level plans can take precedence over more up-to-date regional plans in key planning decisions. We need a system for strategic planning based around interdependent areas on the ground, not one that is constrained by administrative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
boundaries. County boundaries do not work as the basis for effective strategic planning. Many strategic planning issues cut across county boundaries and are best dealt with at a regional or sub-regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need inclusive regional planning bodies, which consult with communities and stakeholders and involve local authorities, to take the lead on reviewing and proposing revisions to regional spatial strategy. That is what part 1 of the Bill is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Cotswold that the new arrangements for regional planning will result in a democratic deficit unless they happen only where there are elected regional assemblies, which he does not support either. First, a system enshrined in law rather than one based on administrative arrangements, such as the regional planning guidance issued as part of the current system, is surely stronger in democratic terms, if only because it is subject to this kind of scrutiny and debate. Secondly, the regional spatial strategy is ultimately the Secretary of State's document, and he is democratically accountable for it to the electorate and to this House. Thirdly, the members of the regional planning body are accountable to their constituent bodies, which include local authority members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments about the democratic deficit imply arbitrary, unaccountable decision making by the regional planning body, which is not a fair picture. Through legislation and guidance, we are ensuring that everyone in the region with an interest will have the opportunity to be involved in the regional planning process, which provides a place for representations, examinations in public and consultation with communities, stakeholders and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that those changes should happen only in regions where people have voted for an elected regional assembly, but he will not be surprised to learn that I do not agree. The regional planning reforms are essential and should be implemented as soon as possible. They should not be delayed and made only in regions in which people have voted for an elected regional assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to stronger regional arrangements in all regions and establishing elected regional assemblies if people vote for them in a referendum. We made that point clear in the regions White Paper, "Your Region, Your Choice". We have said that we are committed to policies that recognise regional differences as a strength for the nation and that are developed closely with the people whom they affect. We want regional solutions founded in regional knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn to the effect of amendments Nos. 271 and 272.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a practical question about accountability. Let us assume that as part of the regional spatial strategy a decision is taken to build 5,000 houses in a town in an area that does not have an elected regional assembly. The people of that town are violently against large-scale house building, perhaps
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
because they feel that their local infrastructure cannot cope with it. What democratic accountability is there for the people in that town? They cannot vote out their elected regional representative because they do not have one. They could vote against their county councillors, but the Bill denudes their county council's planning power. They can protest to their Member of Parliament, but he does not have responsibility for regional spatial strategy. How could those people protest democratically about a decision that they believe to be injurious to their quality of life?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If such a situation were to arise, it would be desperately serious. The premise of the hon. Gentleman's concern is inaccurate, because it assumes that the responsibility for a decision to build 5,000 houses in a locality lies with the regional planning body. That is not the case; it is the responsibility of the local planning authority and the local district. The regional spatial strategy will be a material consideration because it must be embraced in the local development framework, as he knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The responsibility for decisions of that nature is essentially for the locality. It is true that we expect the regional spatial strategy to identify areas of growth, of stability and even of restoration of the green belt. Nevertheless, local people will not face the hon. Gentleman's scenario.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Minister is right. This matter is germane to the whole debate. For many people, in acid terms, the debate comes down to this point. Will he explain which body will take responsibility for the allocation of the number of houses in different towns? In the past, responsibility has filtered through different levels. Under the new system, if it were decided to build so many tens or hundreds of thousands of houses in a region, who will decide where they go, working on the basis that most local authorities would resist large-scale house building in their backyards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I ought to clarify the situation. The Secretary of State is accountable for the regional spatial strategy, which will set the overall target for growth, but the local planning authority will decide the sites. Those houses would have to be in a development plan document for which the local planning authority is accountable. I hope that helps the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see where the Minister is going but it does not help me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local planning authority might have to decide the sites but it would not have to decide the numbers. The number of houses allocated to each local authority is critical. If a local authority is saddled with a certain number of thousands, it must solve the problem of trying to decide where they will go. The number of houses that each local authority gets is critical. Under the new system, how will that decision be taken?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essentially, the global targets for local authorities emerge from the regional spatial strategy, but local decisions about the location of sites will be part of the local planning authority's responsibilities and will form part of the development plan document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I help the Minister? The concern is that local people's wishes and local elections will be completely ignored. I use Kidderminster hospital as an example. A health authority that was appointed by the then Secretary of State—rather like the regional planning bodies that the Secretary of State will appoint—closed it, and the then Secretary of State ratified the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Locally, the political party, Health Concern, which was opposed to the decision, won almost all district and county council elections. The decision resulted in the election of an independent MP with the second largest majority of any Member. It is probably one reason why I was elected, overturning a Conservative seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expression of tens of thousands of local votes meant absolutely nothing, but in this case, there are local powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must keep his interventions briefer than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify the situation even further. It is, as I have said on several occasions, not for the district authority to decide the global target and what the numbers are. However, that situation, essentially, is no different from the present situation. In the present situation, with the exception of two-tier areas, the decision is filtered down through the counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's courtesy in giving way. That is exactly right. Apparently, there is a county tier and the matter is then dealt with through negotiations between the county and the various district councils. However, that tier is being largely taken out of the equation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about structure plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Structure plans are going. In some cases, the regional planning body will effectively be taking decisions to allocate houses to 60 or even 80 different local authorities around the whole region. In the past in my home county, decisions were usually taken in Chelmsford and negotiated with the other councils in Essex; now they will be taken in Cambridge. Theoretically, those decisions will be taken for the whole of East Anglia under this model. What accountability is there in that? Ironically, when it comes to health, the Government have gone the other way. They abolished regional health authorities because, they argued, they were out of touch, and created strategic health authorities on a county model because they believed that such bodies were more responsive to local needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman slightly over-eggs the pudding in suggesting that Cambridge is so remote from Rayleigh that it cannot be aware of the local circumstances. There must be a geographical locus for such a body in any circumstances. However, let me reiterate that the body is not wildly unaccountable. It is constrained by statutes, instead of administrative law; the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament and his decisions are subject to parliamentary scrutiny; and, of course, the regional planning body, in its majority part, comprises elected members, who are accountable to their own
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
authorities. To that extent, we are not talking about an organisation that is wholly removed from any kind of democratic scrutiny or accountability. It has clear lines, in the traditions of our democracy, to democratic accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one area that will be considered as part of the regional spatial strategy that is currently considered by counties is transport and roads. Decisions on roads will move up from county level. I am talking not about trunk roads, but about A and B roads. Planning decisions on new roads will pass up to the regional authority. That is clearly a case in which a matter that is currently decided by elected councillors will be decided, at best, by people who have been quasi-elected—and I do not believe that it is as good as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us remember that the Secretary of State does not appoint regional planning boards: 70 per cent. of the members of regional planning boards are decided on the basis of appointment by local elected authorities. They are elected members, like ourselves, and we would expect them to be responsive to the needs of localities. The other element that comprises the regional planning board is the representatives of the economic and social layers in the locality, who are also representative of local interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have ridden the horse of unaccountability a little too hard. There are issues, and they would be considerably simplified by the emergence of elected regional authorities, but in the meantime we are not talking about the arbitrary disposition of powers by regional planning bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the only Member of Parliament who has ridden winners under rules, I am going to ride this race a lot harder. If a remote, unelected regional body makes a huge increase in a local authority's allocation of houses, there will be a lot of democratic dissatisfaction in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's record on such matter is not very good. The communities plans are an example of that. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) tells me that his local authority was not consulted before the community plan was announced, yet the housing allocation there is to be doubled at a stroke. If the Government behave like that, it is not surprising that, as the hon. Member for Ludlow says, local people will feel aggrieved and will take it out at the local elections by electing somebody else. The Government will have to address that problem, because there will be widespread dissatisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imagine the local authority in my constituency, in the Cotswolds in north-east Gloucestershire, having a hugely increased allocation imposed on it by a regional body sitting 200 miles away in Exeter. That is not local democratic accountability, and the Minister will have to address the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks as though we were totally lacking in experience of regional bodies, but we have had the experience of the regional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
development agencies and we make dispositions about which localities should receive investments through grants, for transport developments, for example. Now we also have the experience of the regional housing boards, where, again, there is a grouping of representatives of the local authorities that, in part, have recently been asked to make dispositions with regard to housing investment. There are always difficult choices in such situations; nevertheless, we have some experience that it is possible for regions to come together and agree about local dispositions within such bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The examples from south-west Bedfordshire, the so-called growth areas, the global issues in the wider south-east and RPG9, which sets targets for housing growth relate to that. I fear that you may intervene on me at any moment, Mr. Hurst, because you think that I am going wider than the subject before us. I shall simply tell the hon. Member for Cotswold that despite all the protests about higher housing targets, it should be recognised that most of the growth catered for in the relevant provisions is indigenous growth. Local people who require more houses—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is absolutely right: he is going too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He wanted to be ruled out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, at last. I fully acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman was with us for 10 minutes at the first sitting, but after six sittings in which he has not appeared, it is my great pleasure, as we come to the dregs of our final sitting, to invite the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is kind, as always, which was totally predictable. Having read 	<i>Hansard,</i> I note that my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow has dominated the Committee with his excellent insights and held the Minister to account admirably. May I ask whether the Minister would feel happier and more comfortable if the regional planning boards were elected and accountable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the intention of the Government, as I understand it is of the hon. Gentleman's party, that we should move towards elected regional authorities. The Government would certainly be content for regional planning boards to operate under that particular form of democratic imprimatur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman prefer them to operate under an assembly, or is he indifferent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are again moving into the merits or otherwise of regional governance, as opposed to the mechanisms set out in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hurst. I do not feel entirely rescued from that issue, but it is perfectly true that we envisage the operation of regional planning boards under the aegis of elected regional authorities. In the meantime, however, we recognise that there is a need for regional planning. The measure sets out that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
regional planning structure within an effective and accountable framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the example of south-west Bedfordshire—a subject on which I want the Minister to respond, for the record. If the region or the Government hand out hugely increased housing targets, surely it is wrong that the local authority should not be consulted first, but should simply be told after the decision has been taken. If that happens, it will give rise to much local dissatisfaction when the regional authorities draw up their regional spatial strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman will understand that I cannot comment on a specific case, because I do not know the circumstances. However, the general principle that he enunciates is absolutely correct. We want that level of consultation and involvement in the elaboration of regional spatial strategies. All my remarks in our proceedings have carried that emphasis. For these objectives to be realised, we look to up-front involvement, to community involvement, to early discussions and to community plans at regional and local levels. I make no bones about the reasons for our commitment to greater community involvement—a thread that runs throughout the measure. Our conviction is that local people have the right to a large say in great changes to their local environment, but we also expect that process of engagement to increase the understanding and acceptance of the case for growth where it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister finishes speaking, I do not want to let him escape having to talk about my reason for tabling amendment No. 117, which, as I said, is a probing amendment. He gave a technical explanation of what the amendment would do, with which I agree. However, I did say that I had tabled it to get him to explain why and in what conditions the Secretary of State would withdraw recognition of a regional planning body, and what the consequences would be if the Secretary of State assumed those powers. He has not yet done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because I am still coming to it; I have been detained on other matters, but let me now hasten forward. Before that last flurry of exchanges, which I welcome, I was about to discuss the effect of amendments Nos. 271 and 272. As I read those two amendments, the latter would leave out subsection (3), and both would prevent the Secretary of State from recognising a body as the regional planning body until such time as a region had voted in favour of an elected regional assembly. In regions where that had not happened, there could be no designated regional planning body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would mean that the Secretary of State would be responsible for preparing the provisions of the regional spatial strategy without any input from local authorities and key stakeholders in the region through the regional chamber. It seems highly unlikely that that centralised approach is what the hon. Gentleman has in mind. If it is, it seems wrong to suppose that the regional planning system would benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
Amendment No. 117 would remove the Secretary of State's power to withdraw recognition of a body as a regional planning body—a power that I would expect the Secretary of State to exercise only in exceptional circumstances. As hon. Members will know, since 1 April this year, the regional chamber in each region has been acting as the RPB. I would envisage regional chambers being derecognised as RPBs if they fail the key test of being inclusive. The need for the RPB to be representative of key regional interests is something that we have emphasised from the Green Paper onwards, because only then can it take a strategic regional view that takes account of the interests of all stakeholders in the region. The draft regulations set minimum criteria for recognition of an RPB: 30 per cent. of members must be drawn from a non-local authority background and have voting rights on planning matters. Where the RPB ceases to meet those criteria it is appropriate that the Secretary of State should be able to withdraw recognition of the body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many ways, the Minister is being reassuring; but as in our discussion on a previous amendment, I am sure that he will be able to assure me that when there are elected regional assemblies, we can expect to see in the Bill that empowers them the ending of the Secretary of State's power to withdraw recognition of a regional planning body. There will then be a democratically accountable regional assembly to which the RPB will be accountable, rather than its being accountable to the Secretary of State, so that will surely be up to the elected regional assembly. Given the Minister's previous enthusiasm, I am sure that he will accede to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman, but let me develop my argument first and then we shall come to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State could not withdraw recognition of an RPB, we could be faced with an RPB that was wholly unrepresentative, and failing to take a strategic regional view. Derecognition is ultimately and properly a decision that should be made by the Secretary of State, but that will not happen in a vacuum, or without prior discussion with interested parties. Any unreasonable use of those powers could be subject to judicial review. We will not act in an arbitrary way. In the unlikely event of derecognition being required in the future, I undertake to publish the reasons for it at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to the hon. Gentleman's point. Those powers are necessary for the situation as it will be when the Bill is enacted, but when elected regional assemblies are established the circumstances will be different. We propose that an elected regional assembly should have statutory responsibility for preparing and publishing the regional spatial strategy. If Parliament agrees to that, it will be for Parliament, not the Secretary of State, to withdraw that responsibility through primary legislation. The circumstances will be completely different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just been looking at clause 11. Can the Minister explain who on an elected regional
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
body will represent the interests of, for example, people who are in the part of Yorkshire that now falls within the Cumbria county council area, but are also in a national park, and so will be dealt with by the Yorkshire and Humberside regional assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to that—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney), who represents a Yorkshire constituency, for the comment from a sedentary position that no part of that national park is in Yorkshire. As a Yorkshire person, he ought to know. However, the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has asked an interesting question. It would be preposterous for me to say that I know the immediate answer to it, but I will undertake to write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made my observations about our expectations of the situation when there is an elected regional assembly. The power to withdraw recognition is simply the necessary and sensible flip side to the power of recognition. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Member for Cotswold to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. When I dreamed up amendment No. 272—it was probably late at night—I had no idea that it would result in such a good debate. I thought that it would be buried under a large list of amendments. I apologise to the Committee for not having been ready to debate clause 2. Because the order of consideration had been changed, I was busy preparing for clause 40—but I am ready now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to probe the Minister a little more. I seek your guidance, Mr. Hurst, as to whether I should do it now, and go slightly wide of the amendments, or whether you will allow a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am minded not to have a clause stand part debate, but the final decision has not yet been taken. It will be taken subject to what is said during the present debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to examine how the regional assemblies are working prior to an affirmative referendum result. They are non-elected bodies. The White Paper "Your region, your choice" makes it perfectly clear that most will have between 30 and 40 members, so most are likely to have only 30 members. The Minister has already said that of those 30 members, 30 per cent. are to have a non-local authority background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A county like Gloucestershire will be lucky if it has one or two representatives on the South West regional assembly. If the people of Gloucestershire want to dabble in the details to find out who those members are, they will discover that their members were indirectly elected by the county council. If they ask those members why, for instance, they have allocated a particular number of houses to the Cotswolds, the members will shelter under the resources and policy committee of the county council from which they receive their instructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional assemblies have no democratic accountability, yet through the RPB they will hand
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
down allocations of the number of houses—probably the most sensitive planning issue that we face. I wonder whether that might cause widespread unrest, particularly in the south of England, which is so densely populated. I acknowledge that many extra houses will be needed there—but the Minister relies on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh said, the Bill makes a fundamental change. Such allocations used to be determined by county councils. In Gloucestershire there was a reasonable degree of consensus among the county councils and the six local authorities about where the county council's target should go. I cannot see that degree of consensus happening under the new regional structure, because it takes the decision making away from locally elected bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone was dissatisfied with the targets handed out by his county council, he could easily find out who his local county councillor was. As I have already made clear, it will be much more difficult to find out who is his indirectly elected member on the regional assembly. Even when he has found out, that member will shelter under the relevant committee of the body that elected him. There must be an element of democratic deficit in the procedure that the Government are embarking upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I emphasise a point that I consider to be integral? Even under the current system of county structure plans, there was always a degree of haggling and horse trading about how many houses each district council should have. No one is saying that that was not a controversial process; it often was. However, because most councillors came from the same county and were relatively familiar with the areas in question, they eventually managed to broker a workable arrangement, based partly on the advantage of their local knowledge. The process will now be written for regions on a much larger scale. Many of the people taking the decisions about who will end up with so many thousands of houses in a local authority area will have little knowledge of that place or of the issues faced by the people who live there. That is a potentially dangerous move and, as my hon. Friend points out, will only increase resentment about what will be seen as a remote imposition of houses on people who do not want them to be there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is building on what I was about to say. In practice, Gloucestershire will send its two members to the regional assembly committee that discusses the matter. They will be heavily outvoted, by 28 to two, they will go back to the county council committee that elected them, and it will ask, "Why did you agree to this allocation of houses for Gloucestershire?" and they will say, "We are sorry but we were outvoted 28 to two; there was nothing we could do about it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I carefully wrote down the Minister's words. He said that the regional assemblies would be accountable to constituent bodies. They will not be accountable in the slightest. The numbers are such that those bodies will simply be outvoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Alan Whitehead 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southampton, Test)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not confusing the numbers presently on the indirectly elected regional assemblies and those that would be elected to a regional assembly, which are not the same? One is much larger than the other. Secondly, could he explain why the procedure that he describes is fundamentally different from what occurred, for example, under Serplan, in the southeast, where a similarly indirectly elected body was responsible for the figures as they arose at a regional level and then percolated down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the first part of what the hon. Gentleman says. In the current indirectly elected regional assemblies, there are more than 30—I accept that—but the numbers are not much greater, so the same comments apply. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh, sotto voce from a sedentary position, responds immediately to the hon. Gentleman's second point by saying that the county council layer was there as a filter. While the region and the RPGs might have handed out a figure to the counties, the counties negotiated with the districts. A county is a fully elected, democratically accountable body. People can easily find out who their county councillor is and complain if they do not like what the county council has done. In Gloucestershire the system works reasonably well. The county council has a good dialogue with all six constituent local authorities, which, as the Minister made clear, have to implement the policy and decide exactly where the houses are to be sited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the Bill, we are arguing about the difference between the current arrangement and the arrangement proposed by the Minister. However, one can think of a wealth of alternative arrangements that would be more democratic than either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. However, we cannot consider that, as we are asked to consider only what the Government propose. That is a great pity. In that respect, it is a shame that the regions are set in stone and the regional boundaries cannot be re-examined. I am sure that by the time the Government have had a bloody nose and a few of the referendums have gone wrong, they will revert to looking at the boundaries. Then they might make them more acceptable.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh says, how the regional planning bodies draw up their regional spatial strategies is central to the Bill. If it is perceived that they are not taking full account of local people's wishes, we are in for a long period of dissatisfaction. I have listened carefully to the Minister. His arguments have been patient and cogent. However, in view of what he has said, I shall press amendment No. 272 to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up a couple of factual points. First, I should inform the hon. Member for Cotswold that the regional chamber in the south-west has 117 members, not 30, so there is an opportunity for a more extensive representation of Gloucestershire than he asserted. A regional planning body of that scope has capacity for representation of, at least, a greater degree of local information, knowledge and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
sensitivity than he suggested. It is interesting that the likely size of an elected regional assembly in the same area will be 30 to 35, so democratic legitimacy may be gained at the expense of some intimate local knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A broader point is that in the past, under the previous Administration, the Secretary of State determined the level of housing provision in the county and unitary authorities with absolutely no opportunity for public examination of those allocations. The truth is that under our arrangements there will be an examination in public and it will be a considerably more open, accessible and transparent system than ever prevailed at the time when the hon.

	<p>Government amendments Nos. 8 and 9.</p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that in an earlier debate, the hon. Member for Cotswold put forward an amendment to clause 40. He sought to delete subsection (6) of proposed new section 61D, which states:
	<br><q><p>"If a statement of development principles is issued outline planning permission (within the meaning of section 92) must not be granted for a similar development before the end of the relevant period."</p></q>
That period is before three weeks, or such other period as the local planning authority directs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) was originally intended to avoid overcomplicating the planning process by preventing the situation whereby a developer can seek a statement of development principles that is followed by outline planning permission, which is then followed by an application for approval of reserved matters. However, as my predecessor on the Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), now the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, said previously, we see merit in the earlier amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Cotswold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that subsection (6) has proved unpopular. I and previous planning Ministers have received a number of representations suggesting that the provision could be used as a spoiling tactic by competitors who wish to prevent a developer from seeking outline planning permission. There have been arguments that it might be useful for a developer to hold both a statement and outline planning permission, particularly if the statement was sought at a very early stage. It has also been suggested that no one would ever apply for a statement if it prevented
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
people from subsequently applying for outline planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have listened to the arguments and found them persuasive. I therefore hope that hon. Members will be able to accept amendment No. 8. Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 are technical amendments brought forward as a result of amendment No. 8. The amendments do not change any of the Bill's provisions, but simply tidy up the drafting of the clause. Subsection (6), the provision which is to be removed, refers to "the relevant period". Following its removal, amendments Nos. 7 and 9 are needed to delete the notion of a "relevant period" from the remainder of the clause and instead make the durational provisions a part of new subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the non-Government amendments. May I pause for a second there, Mr. Hurst, to confirm that I am in order in continuing to speak to amendment No. 205?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should reply to it if the hon. Member who tabled it mentions it during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the inclusion of Government amendments Nos. 7 to 9. There were clearly significant problems, which were highlighted by Opposition Members and Government Back Benchers in the first Committee, with the abolition of outline planning permission. The Minister has listed a number of the problems, and I welcome the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 205 has been tabled by Conservative Members, and I shall be happy to listen to their arguments. I should like to ask you, Mr. Hurst, whether there is likely to be a clause stand part debate or whether I can use this group of amendments as a suitable vehicle to discuss the statement of development principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would be wise to keep to the amendments. I shall make a decision during the course of the debate as to whether it will be appropriate to have a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for that clarification, Mr. Hurst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with one problem, the Government have got themselves into another with their amendments. The problem concerns the relevant status of outline planning permission and the statement of development principles. Let me give an example, which will not be hypothetical. A member of the public seeks to purchase a house. The investment is substantial and they want to make sure that the surrounding area will remain greenfield. New section 61D(1) states that
	<br><q><p>"A local planning authority must issue a statement of development principles in relation to a proposed development in their area if they are requested to do so by any person."</p></q>
The person does not have to have an interest in the piece of land in question. Somebody who is about to purchase a house could ask for a statement of development principles on the adjoining land. They could say, "I want to know whether it is possible to build a factory or houses on that land." They could receive a statement of development principles from the council that stated, "Houses will not be permitted
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
because this is greenfield." That would be a possible outcome of a statement of development principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The person purchases the house in those circumstances. Now outline planning permissions are back, the statement of development principles will presumably have been issued by the officers of the council. It will not have come from the committee because it is a statement of principles rather than a planning decision. A few months after the person has bought the house, the adjoining field is put up for housing and outline permission is sought. That would be contrary to the local development document, but there could be good reasons for that. Perhaps the planning committee decided to overrule their planning officers—it happens—and granted permission. To all intents and purposes, the statement of development principles, which was issued only a few months before, would be utterly worthless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Somebody could make a major financial investment in an adjoining property on the grounds that the council has just issued them with a statement of development principles. That is why I ask about the status of statements of development principles and outline planning permissions or, indeed, full planning permissions. Although we know that the statement of development principles is a material consideration in a planning permission—it is not a material consideration in an outline planning permission, although the Government may want to introduce that by amending the Bill—it is only a material consideration. Of course, there are many other material considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urged that our debate on clause 40 was brought forward because of this genuine worry. The Government have done the right thing in allowing outline planning permission for exactly the reasons that the Minister gave. However, in doing so, they created additional problems that have not yet been thought through to ensure that the system works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the Government are trying to achieve with statements of development principles, but they could be worthless—people just will not bother to apply for them—or, perhaps worse than that, they could be misleading. The Government may envisage the statements generally being sought by land developers, but I believe that people with an interest in adjoining land will be the major users. They will see a statement of development principles as a means of getting a statement about the piece of land next to them. On the basis of that they may make financial investments, borrow against it or extend their mortgage on a property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of that could be affected, because the statement of development principles is not a strong document. It does not say, "and all planning permissions will follow in line". Someone is fairly certain to get planning permission if they follow the conditions in an outline planning permission, which is stronger. Hence, a reason that the Minister did not give for the restoration of outline planning permission is that there are many developers whose land values are based on existing outline planning permissions. They have borrowings against them. If such permissions were, to all intents and purposes, abolished overnight, many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>375</span>
developers would suddenly discover that they were close to insolvency. That was another concern that was raised about the removal of outline planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has done exactly the right thing, but he has left a hole. I hope that he can find a way of closing it. The simplest way—not necessarily the way forward—would be to remove the whole clause. If there were no statements of development principles, there would still be outline planning permission, and the system would work. That is the Government's fallback position. The system would still work if clause 40 were removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is good intent behind the statement of development principles, but there must be a strong clarification of its status and how it relates to outline planning permission, planning permission and local development documents. A statement could be issued on a piece of land and then a revision, which, I hope, would now happen much more quickly, could be made of a local development document. If the local development document related to the piece of land, it would instantly change. At present, that can happen with a local plan, but it could take two and a half years or more—and that is quick for changing a local plan—during which period the person would have plenty of time to get involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee that local development documents will move faster than that. The council could issue a statement of development principles and then begin the revision process on a local development document a month later. A year later, everything will have changed and the value of the property will have been materially affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that changes in the planning system can materially affect the value of properties. The concern is that statements of development principles will give people a false sense of certainty. The relative merits of the different components of the system must be made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is my intention to allow a short break from our deliberations. Accordingly, I suspend the Committee until 5.20 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<p>5.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have received many representations on this matter. It might be worth recording what clause 40 is intended to do. The Government's explanatory memorandum states:
	<br><q><p>"Clause 40 introduces a new procedure for any person wishing to obtain an indication from a local planning authority as to whether a proposed development would be acceptable in principle. On application, an authority will be required to issue a statement of development principles which will indicate whether or not the authority agree with the principle of all or part of the proposed development. The statement will not be a consent"—</p></q>
I stress that—but, as the hon. Member for Ludlow made clear,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
	<br><q><p>"its existence will be a material consideration for the purpose of determining a future planning application for similar development."</p></q>
While considering clause 40, we would have liked to consider my amendment No. 206. It relates to schedule 3, which abolishes section 92 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which relates to outline planning permission. Schedule 6 also removes section 92 from the principal Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having considered the matter, we would like clause 40 to be abolished altogether. We do not see the merits of the statement of development principles. We cannot see that it speeds up the present system or makes it more transparent, and we have had many representations in relation to that. However, having had our original amendment to abolish subsection (6) graciously accepted—that is why my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh and I co-signed Government amendment No. 8; it has been a long time coming, but we won this small concession from the Government, for which I am grateful—it would be helpful to hear from the Minister about the Government's proposals in relation to abolishing outline planning permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to that invitation. I am aware of the anxieties of developers and house builders about statements of development principles and outline planning permissions. I know that developers see the latter as—I think the phrase has already been used—the bankable asset in the process. I am continuing to consider these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that gets us very far. Developers will still believe that it is in the Government's mind to abolish outline planning permission. Outline planning permission has been available since 1950. It allows the planning authority to give a decision in principle and to reserve details for approval subsequently. Outline planning permission can be granted only for the erection of a building. Reserved matters include the site, design, external appearance, means of access and landscaping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told of a problem by a huge range of people. The statement of development principles is not a bankable asset. There is no certainty about it and one cannot raise finance on it. Let us consider a large-scale development: perhaps one of the supermarket chains wants to build a supermarket. It will go along to the landowner and say that it would like to do that. Under the old system, the local authority would grant outline planning permission, which would have a duration of five years. The supermarket would then be able to go away and get funding on the basis of that outline planning permission. The statement of development principles will not provide people with that certainty. Therefore, far from speeding up the system, the statement of development principles will slow it down and make matters more difficult, particularly in terms of regeneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received representations stating that, where it is necessary to accumulate large blocks of property to carry out urban regeneration, developers have already been through the compulsory purchase procedure that is in the Bill, and that that can sometimes take three years on its own. The developer then has to sort out whether he needs to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
renew the consent. Permission is not straightforward or cheap, and a great deal of investment, in terms of time and money, is required to obtain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that the Government have had a change of heart and deleted the "lockout" in subsection (6). It will be possible, if a statement of development principles has been issued, to obtain an outline planning permission for the time being. Those developers that have not got that far, however, will never know whether the Government will announce the abolition of the outline planning permission. In a way, the Government's lack of clarity makes the situation even more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I discussed another aspect of the statement of development principles with the planning officer in Wandsworth. Bearing in mind the fact that anyone can apply for a planning application on any piece of land, a number of people will visit the local planning authority to obtain a statement of development principles in order to freeze a particular piece of land and stop its future development. They know that the current council will not allow development on it, that it will produce the statement of development principles to that effect, and that no one will be able to apply for another statement or an outline planning permission for at least two years, under subsection (5). We tabled amendment No. 205, which would delete subsection (5), so that there would not be the lockout period of two years. It makes eminent sense, and I plead with with the Minister that, as well as deleting subsection (6), we should delete subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a double danger? First, people will seek a statement of development principles to block development. Secondly, given that outline planning permission has been reinstated, anybody could obtain an outline that would overrule a statement of development principles. They would have laboured under the false sense of certainty that there would be no development. The provision is in danger of working both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. His scenario is a very real possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to tease out why the Government have introduced the statement of development principles at all. The only reason I can think of is that there are a number of extant outline planning permissions on which development is not taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will discuss clause 46 and the duration of consent, but, if the Government are determined to reduce the period of consent for all planning permissions—not only outline permissions—from three to five years, they will prod a lot of people into putting more energy into developing sites. What, however, needs remedying? How many extant outline planning permissions are there; how far are they responsible for slowing down the planning system; and how will the introduction of the statement of development principles speed up the system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By deleting subsection (6) and retaining outline planning permission with the statement of development principles, we have one eighth of a loaf. There is great concern among practitioners,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
developers, retailers and wholesalers that the statement of development principles is not the answer. It will slow down the system and make it more difficult for them to develop difficult city centre sites. I have a particular worry over regeneration and assembling land with compulsory purchase when the compulsory purchase procedure is going to take a long time, and the poor developer, having got his outline planning permission, is then going to run up against time. Will he apply for another outline planning permission, or for a detailed planning permission? The uncertainty of the present situation will make things very difficult for such developers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold and to the Committee for not having heard his first few words on the amendment, but I find the arguments against the statement of development principles not entirely convincing. I am interested in what the hon. Member for Ludlow has to say. There should be a clear understanding, on purchases of land, that simply making a statement of development principles, issued on the land that surrounds it and protects the view, is worthless. The hon. Gentleman used the word "worthless", and let us be absolutely clear that it is indeed worthless so that no one reading this debate, as I am sure many future prospective purchasers of houses will do, reads the first part of his remarks and thinks, "Gosh, what a jolly good wheeze" and does not notice that it is worthless for the purposes that he described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I served as a councillor, what the Government call a statement of development principles was known as a planning brief. It was drawn up by the local authority on a piece of land or small area, and set out the sort of considerations that it would have in mind should an application for that land come forward. The initiative could then be taken by a developer, who had perhaps had discussions with the planning officers behind closed doors. That was a way of bringing out into the open the element of those discussions that was of interest to local people, without disclosing what might be confidential. It had the great merit that local people did not feel that those matters were being dealt with behind closed doors, where a deal was being signed between developers and planning officers that the local people were out of until, bang, there was an outline application, or even a more detailed one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters were dealt with by planning committees or sometimes by the whole council—and we still did not meet for more than two half days a week. A planning brief, as we called it, would be issued that said that the council was thinking about a certain level of extra traffic, a certain sort of massing, a certain sort of landscaping, perhaps a three-storey building being reduced to two storeys where it abutted an existing listed building, and such and such a provision for car parking—car parking was quite popular with planners in those days. That gave a good picture for the planning committee to discuss. There might be consideration of transport access, bicycle parking, or footpaths and pedestrian access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>379</span>
What happens in local authorities that do not have a development brief system? I shall tell the Committee, because mine is one. Suddenly an application pops up. It is discussed by the planners and the developer behind closed doors and the local residents are faced with a detailed planning application. I shall give an example: the Whippingham trailer park. My constituency needs a place where trailers—the back ends of articulated lorries—can be held preparatory to putting them on to ferries. A lorry cannot drive straight on to a ferry if it is not there; there must be a holding place. Both Wightlink and Red Funnel have great difficulty finding sufficient capacity at the ferry terminals in Fishbourne and East Cowes respectively for such trailer parking, because they are in the middle of towns. For a long time, there has been a need for a trailer park—a need that is recognised by the transport portfolio holder on my local authority, the transportation officers and the planning department. The only place it is not recognised is the unitary development plan. Somehow, the local authority managed to develop a unitary development plan without deciding where the trailer park would be. It was left entirely to private enterprise, to which I have no objection, to take the initiative and find a site. Presumably it has bought an option on the site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will bang in an application for that, which will be determined in six weeks, in accordance with Government guidelines. It is a detailed application. However, there has been no public consultation, and there will be none until the application is submitted. Consequently, members of the public have not had the opportunity to have their say about the level of lighting; the quality of the landscaping; whether access should be from a road called Racecourse road or from East Cowes road; or the additional traffic that will be brought into Wootton because Wootton village is between the proposed Whippingham trailer park and Fishbourne. Those issues must now be dealt with in the application. One must have good reasons to reject an application, but not to amend a planning brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All major applications of that sort would benefit from planning briefs. I accept that the Government do not propose that, but it would greatly enhance public participation in the planning process if the public could express their views on what would or would not be acceptable on a site before the formality of an application intrudes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When those proposals are submitted, the owner, or whoever is making the application for Whippingham trailer park, will go through a statement of development principles. Under the Government's comprehensive performance assessment targets, 90 per cent. of all applications will be delegated to officers—almost all statements of development principles are likely to be delegated to officers—who will then issue a statement of development principles without consulting their committees. Once they have issued those statements of development principles, with no public consultation, the committee will have great difficulty
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
in turning down a full application because a statement of development principles is a material consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely.

As I understand it—the Minister is nodding; I have been told that it is useful to mention it if the Minister is nodding—it is wise that sensitive requests should not be dealt with by officers behind closed doors, but by the committee, with a full public consultation in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware from what I said that I do not completely oppose the concept of statements of development principles. He has done the Committee a service by outlining a way in which they could work well, although I must say that his outline is not what the Government have envisaged. He may have given them a way to introduce statements of development principles, which would work in the way that he described without the worry of whether they have any value, as I described. He may well have provided the Government and their advisers with a route forward in that difficult area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. The Minister was nodding so enthusiastically that I took it to be a commitment to introduce the necessary amendments on Report. He is not nodding now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall never nod again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None the less, I genuinely hope that the Minister will take that point. I had not read the clause in sufficient detail to know whether what I am saying is in line with it; that is for other Members to interpret. I hope that these statements will be encouraged and that when they are requested, their consideration will be public business. I am interested in the fact that any person can seek a statement of development principles. I am sure that we shall have interesting applications in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again, the Committee has seen the fruits of the 18 years that the hon. Gentleman spent on Oxford city council. I was genuinely interested in his reference to a planning brief. However, I am a nodder by nature—I am an empathiser. While I caution him not to read too much into my body language, it seems to me that the hon. Gentleman has got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen in the proposal for statements of development principles benefits both for the community, in the sense that he described, and for the developer. Let me immediately offer him this reassurance and attempt to add a little more precision to it. We expect there to be the same amount of public involvement in the drawing up of statements of development principles as there is for planning applications. Indeed, requirements are set out in the draft for the part 4 regulations under the Bill. They lie in paragraph 43, which I shall quote:
	<br><q><p>"A local planning authority must carry out the same consultation and publicity as it would for an application for planning permission."</p></q>
That is so that its decision in respect of the statement of development principles is informed in the same way
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
as any subsequent application for planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local planning authority must take into account any representations received—it is intended that there should be involvement and transparency in those matters. As well as benefits for the community, we have also seen in the proposals benefits for the developer. The clause is intended to allow potential developers to ascertain the acceptability of the principle of a proposed development on a particular site without requiring the local planning authority to examine the detail. Its purpose is similar to outline planning permission, but it does not grant the applicant any consent to do the works. It is about half way between an officer's informed view and an outline planning permission. It offers advantages over outline planning permission, where issues such as quality and design are not always considered effectively, and where there have been concerns about approval being given before an environmental impact assessment has been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our intention that the new procedure will at first supplement, and might eventually replace, outline planning permission. As we have always said, we will not abolish outline planning permission until we are sure that statements of development principles are successful. I hope that that offers some reassurance to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ludlow asked about the status of a statement of development principles and possible subsequent outline planning permission. Let me try to explain. A local planning authority must, when considering an application for a statement of development principles or an outline planning permission, have regard to the development plan set out in new section 61D(2). A statement of development principles in respect of the same site would be a material consideration for a subsequent application for outline planning permission. Draft guidance explaining that further has been issued this month. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still somewhat concerned about the status of the statement of development principles. Let me put it another way. Let us suppose that a developer were to obtain a statement of development principles, but then went for, but was refused, outline planning permission for something similar to the originally proposed project. Let us say that the officer dealt with the developer the first time, but that the committee then refused the outline planning permission, perhaps against the advice of the officer. Would there then be grounds for an appeal against the committee's decision, because there was a material consideration involved? Does the statement have weight in that sense, even if it does not have any legal weight in the sense that outline planning does in financial terms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks the precise question: does the statement have weight in that sense? The answer is that it does. Outline planning permission is a planning permission, so a statement of development principles will be a material consideration for outline planning applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
I have attempted twice to clarify the issue. I am not sure that I can say much more than what I have said, but I have at least attempted to respond to the hon. Gentleman's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to those listening to our debates or reading the proceedings if the Minister said why he needed to introduce the new concept. He has said that the proposals will lead to a halfway house between the officer's informal view and outline planning permission. What is the advantage of the new system, and what is the problem with the existing system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has heard my explanation and the interesting views of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. The proposals will give the developer the benefit of exploring the possibilities of a development and understanding what conditions there may be, yet without having to work through the mass of detail and make the huge investment that an application for planning permission normally requires. The provisions will help to rationalise the process and make it more cost-efficient. They will open up the prospect of an engagement on all sides. That way, the planners, the planning committee and the would-be developer can understand what might be required without the massive investment in time, space and finance needed to work up a complete project. That is the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have previously asked the Minister about a developer, and he confirmed that the developer going to an appeal would be a consideration if the application was subsequently turned out. To return to the situation that I described earlier, if an adjoining landowner or householder seeks and obtains a statement of development principles from the officer that a field will stay green field, but a month later the planning committee grants an outline or full planning permission to somebody on that land—again, perhaps against the advice of the officers—could the adjoining landowners seek judicial review, given that the Minister is not minded to favour limited third-party right of appeal? I want the system to succeed, but such cases could discredit it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, let me attempt to answer the hon. Gentleman by reminding him that all such developments will occur in the context of the local development framework, which we debated at considerable length in relation to new clause 49. All proposals and designations will be subject to exactly the sort of detailed process of community involvement and pre-application discussions that we have talked about already. To be frank, I find the scenario depicted by the hon. Member for Ludlow of an application out of the blue and a sudden, unexpected granting of that application improbable against the backdrop of what we have debated and what we are seeking to set in place. All I can do is repeat for the third time that the statement of development principle will be a material consideration in relation to any application.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
I will now go on to deal with amendment No. 205, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Cotswold. Amendment No. 205 would prevent a local planning authority from declining to issue a statement where it had issued a statement disagreeing with the principle of all or part of a similar development within the previous two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the concern that an authority might decline to issue a statement even where a potential developer has changed some factors of a proposed development in order to address concerns raised by the local planning authority in the first statement. However, it would be illogical to require an authority to deal with repeated requests for statements of development principles when, elsewhere in the Bill, we are proposing to provide them with the power to decline to determine repeated requests for planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an authority issues a statement disagreeing with all or part of the proposed development it will need to include in the statement its reasons why the development is unacceptable. If a developer subsequently amends his or her proposals in order to meet these concerns, it would be unreasonable for the local planning authority to argue that the development was substantially the same and therefore decline to issue a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By now, the Committee will have seen the secondary legislation package which accompanies part 4, which we issued for consultation on 13 October. That includes draft guidance on this point. It makes it clear that, where a potential developer has amended the proposed development in order to meet concerns raised by the local planning authority in the first statement, a local planning authority should not decline to issue a statement of development principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, which I hope reassures the hon. Member for Cotswold—who is nodding and one must always make it clear when a member of the Committee is nodding—I invite him to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say yes—the Minister's assurance is very helpful. It clarifies subsection (5). I want one other greater clarification from the Minister. I am sorry to labour the point, but when we have dealt with it we can move on. The Minister says that it is his intention to abolish outline planning permission at some stage, or at least that is my understanding given what he has said. Would he explain to the Committee how he will consult before taking that decision so that those using the planning system know at what point outline planning permission is likely to be abolished?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be a proper consultation before any such move is made, but let me say in the meantime that we intend to run the systems side by side, and it will be only when we are satisfied that the statement of relevant principles is a sustainable arrangement that we shall move over to that system. Let me also reiterate for the sake of clarity that I am aware of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
representations and concerns that are being expressed on those matters, and I continue to take them into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an extremely useful debate. The Minister's explanations have been very helpful.

	<div class='title'>DURATION OF PERMISSION AND CONSENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 18 to 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 19 provides that where planning permission is granted and subsequently challenged in a court of law, the duration of the permission or consent will be from the date of grant until three years, or another period as directed by the determining authority, after completion of the legal proceedings. It might be helpful if I explain that in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A decision to grant planning permission, taken by the local planning authority or the Secretary of State on appeal, can be challenged in the courts. It has been suggested to us that there has been a significant rise in the number of such challenges in recent years by objectors and competitors, whose aim appears to be to delay the start of a development, or even to prevent it entirely, by running it out of time. Where a grant of planning permission is challenged, it is likely to be imprudent for the prospective developer to commence his development until the challenge has been disposed of. However, that clearly presents a potential problem, because the clause reduces the period of validity of a consent, generally from five years to three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the clause also prevents the renewal of planning permissions. We recognise that there may be cases in which the combined effect of these factors could unreasonably jeopardise a development. Where a decision to grant planning permission is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
subsequently upheld by the court, it is right that the developer should be given the necessary time to implement that permission. Amendment No. 19 therefore provides for the period of consent to start again after the completion of any legal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are technical amendments, which are necessary as a consequence of amendment No. 19. They simply allow the provisions that I have just set out to be incorporated into the Town and Country Planning Act 1990—the principal Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 22 provides that where listed buildings consent or conservation area consent is granted and subsequently challenged in a court of law, the duration of the consent will be from the date of grant until three years, or for another period as directed by the determining authority, after the completion of the legal proceedings. The amendment applies the same provisions to listed buildings consent and conservation area consent as amendment No. 19 applies in respect of planning permission, and is being introduced for the same reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 are technical amendments, which are necessary as a consequence of amendment No. 22. They simply allow the provisions in that amendment to be incorporated into the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition warmly welcome the amendments, as the Minister can see from the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh and I co-signed them. They are a very useful clarification of the system. However, the same sort of argument applies to conditions. If a planning permission is granted with conditions, it can often take up to three years to fulfil them, particularly if a complex compulsory purchase is involved. The developer then runs up against the time scale. I wonder whether, under such circumstances, the extension could be extended from, for example, the date of fulfilling a particular condition if a statutory procedure, such as compulsory purchase, were involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to confess to the hon. Gentleman that that is a new one on me. Without making a commitment, I will reflect on his observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be helpful. I did not dream the issue up out of the blue; we have received serious representations from practitioners and developers about it. The Minister must have inspiration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Inspiration has yet again winged its way to me. I can assist the hon. Gentleman without having to reflect on his observations. I draw the attention of the Committee to the draft guidance on the part 4 regulations. In paragraph 92, entitled "Variation from standard time limits", it says:
	<br><q><p>"Where particularly complex development is due to take place, for example major regeneration projects, three years is unlikely to be long enough to allow developers to complete all the preparation needed before starting work. In such cases applicants should seek to agree with local planning authorities that any permission or consent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
granted should be subject to a longer time limit. Applicants are advised to discuss with local planning authorities at the earliest possible stage what time limits would be appropriate. Local planning authorities should look favourably upon requests for longer periods of duration where there are valid planning grounds for such a request."</p></q>
I am aware that that is a rather long intervention, Mr. Hurst.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is making the speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Mr. Hurst. I had leapt to my feet, and I was imagining—it is getting late, and we have been here a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the record, I was for a moment unsure as to the precise nature of the point made by the hon. Member for Cotswold. I would like to set the record straight in case an interested party should read the record of the proceedings. The point was not new to me; it is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the concern about the three-year limit in the Bill. We set it for good reasons. As the Committee is aware, there are suspicions that once permission has been granted, developers will sit on a development without taking action for an excessively long time, for a variety of reasons. That causes difficulties for other potential developments in the area, and for the general plans and purposes of local planning authorities. We think that those suspicions are right, and in introducing the time limit we are responding to the planning profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there will be a number of circumstances—particularly those involving large-scale regeneration and large-scale housing developments, which require complex negotiation across a raft of issues—in which three years will be an unrealistic time scale. In such circumstances, as the guidance states, we would be open to an extension of that period. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly offers considerable assistance. As always, the Minister has been very helpful. I wonder if he could be a little more specific about the circumstances under which the local authority would be expected to extend the timetable; otherwise, in practice, developers—particularly large-scale developers—would worry about not having their planning consent extended or even renewed. They would make a material start on the development, and it would lie idle while a dispute went on between the local authority and the developer, negating the benefits of the clause. If the Minister could be a little more specific, that would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not go down the familiar route of "whatifery". I am not sure that it would be helpful if I identified specific circumstances or cases. Let me draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the purposes of the guidance. I say again:
	<br><q><p>"Applicants are advised to discuss with local planning authorities at the earliest possible stage what time limits would be appropriate."</p></q>
We also say:
	<br><q><p>"Local planning authorities should look favourably upon requests for longer periods of duration where there are valid planning grounds for such a request."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
We cannot say fairer, nor be clearer, than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the Government amendments, which deal with a particular concern relating to the reduction of planning consents from five to three years. In general terms, we support that reduction. For exactly the reasons that the Minister has outlined, there have been some problems with planning consents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister confirmed that the reason that amendments have been tabled is that local planning authorities have not been using the powers that are currently available to them. At the moment, they can make planning permission less than or more than five years if they want to. The only problem is that the legislation gives five years as an indication. It is almost routine for local authorities to stick five years on every single application that comes forward. The concern that arose when most people read about the reduction was that where everything had got five years, everything would now get three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislative change is correct, but the Minister needs to do a strong selling job to local authorities to make it clear to them that they can still vary the period in both directions—from less than three years to more than three years. He has already set out the circumstances in which more than three years would be suitable. The great danger is that many planning authorities will just substitute three for five and not sufficiently follow the guidance. We need an extra strong effort to make sure that the message gets through that the duration should be suitable to the type of application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on to a good point. Section 91 of the principal Act states that five years is the maximum. It is perfectly possible for a planning authority to reduce the maximum to whatever level is reasonable under the circumstances. It is just that, as the hon. Gentleman says, it tends to use five years as a matter of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. He is slightly wrong, as I do not think that five years is the maximum. Even under current legislation, a planning authority could in certain circumstances give planning permission with a period longer than five years, just as it will be able under this legislation to give planning permission of longer than three years. The problem has been that local authorities have been slightly lazy and just taken the figure in the 1990 Act as the figure to be followed. I can see that I am about to be corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 91 of the principal Act states that subject to the provisions of that section
	<br><q><p>"the development to which it relates must be begun not later than the expiration of—
	<ol>
	<li>five years beginning with the date on which the permission is granted or, as the case may be, deemed to be granted; or</li>
	<li>such other period (whether longer or shorter) beginning with that date as the authority concerned with the terms of planning permission may direct."</li></ol></p></q>
The hon. Gentleman is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification—I am slightly relieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much welcome the amendments, which deal with the particular position relating to a legal challenge. They make a great deal of sense. We agree with the intention to reduce most planning applications down from five to three years, but we need to get the message across to planning authorities that they have the discretion to vary. If we were quickly to ring up all planning officers and ask them what length of time a planning application could be, they would say five years without saying that they could vary it one way or the other. The great danger is that, if there is a similar ring-round a few years down the line, they will say that it should be three years and still not think that it could be varied in both directions. The message needs to get through that we must use the right length of time for each type of application and that three years is the norm but not the absolute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
By leaving out subsections (3) and (4) and inserting a new subsection (3), amendment No. 137 is designed to ensure that an examination in public is held on any draft revision of the regional spatial strategy—yes, we are back to RSSs. Section 35B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 requires county councils
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
to hold a public examination of an alteration to a structure plan. The same requirement should apply to a regional planning body altering its regional spatial strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding whether a public examination is to be held, subsection 4(c) requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the
	<br><q><p>"level of interest shown in the draft".</p></q>
I am unsure what that would mean. Would it be the number of letters of objection, the number of people attending local consultative meetings or the amount of column inches in local newspapers? It is unclear what the "level of interest" is. It was a major topic of discussion when I worked on the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill just under a year ago. Those discussions went on for weeks, but I do not want us to go on for weeks, and we clearly cannot. I would be grateful if the Minister provided clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 136 is broadly along the same lines in that it seeks to ensure a public examination. It is designed to improve public confidence in strategic planning, which is arguably the most critical level of planning for major infrastructure developments. It would also ensure that the draft was subject to effective scrutiny. That is done by removing the "may" and inserting "must", so that the examination would have to be held in public. Again, if the Minister is minded to refuse the amendments, as Ministers often are, an explanation of the likely reasons why an examination would be held in public or, more importantly, why the Secretary of State might not want to hold one in public, would be very useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 138 would leave out subsection (4). That would take away the Secretary of State's power to decide whether an examination in public would be held in respect of the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy. Essentially, that is in line with previous amendments. If there must be an examination in public, this is the corollary amendment, which removes the Secretary of State's powers to decide which examination that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 would delete line 22, which is a separate way of trying to deal with the matter. If the Minister accepts amendment No. 138, amendment No. 139 will be superfluous, but I suspect that he probably will not, so I am giving him another chance. Amendment No. 139 would delete the caveat whereby the Secretary of State, when deciding whether an examination in public is to be held, must have regard to
	<br><q><p>"such other matters as he thinks appropriate."</p></q>
That is a fairly overarching power for the Secretary of State. He can clearly think that virtually any matter is appropriate or not, so that gives him carte blanche to decide whether there should be an examination in public. Essentially, he could remove paragraphs (a) to (c) because he thought that many factors were more important than his regard for those paragraphs. Effectively, paragraph (d) is a catch-all to allow the Secretary of State to make whichever decision he wishes, regardless of the position in paragraphs (a)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>391</span>
to (c). If the Minister is not minded to accept amendment No. 139, he might at least explain what some of those matters are that the Secretary of State might think appropriate—just for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 is a clarificatory Government amendment, which we are happy to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ludlow, so the love-in between the Opposition parties referred to by the Minister still goes on. I am sure that it will not continue for the rest of the evening, but it does for the time being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading clause 6, I feel rather aggrieved. The Minister went at me pretty hard over independent examination and who might appear during the independent examination of local plans. Whereas I sought to put in the Bill a minor safeguard to prevent local plan inspectors from becoming absolutely swamped, under this clause there may be no right whatever to appear before an independent inspector, or to make recommendations to the Secretary of State that have to be considered. Clause 6 is pretty all-encompassing, as the hon. Gentleman made clear. I agree with him, and I would like to see subsection (4) abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly dislike subsection (4)(d), which amendment No. 139 would strike out. I dislike the subjective way in which the paragraph is written. It gives anyone who is aggrieved and has to go to a judicial review yet another hurdle to overcome. A far better and more objective direct wording, due to that additional hurdle, would be "such other matters as are appropriate" instead of "he thinks appropriate". The Secretary of State, as the hon. Gentleman made clear, may think anything he likes, but if one is writing legislation it should be clear and objective. Therefore, I dislike the wording in paragraph (d) and I strongly urge the Committee to support the hon. Gentleman's amendments. I hope that he presses amendment No. 137 to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention behind amendment No. 137 seems to be to make the regional planning body, rather than the Secretary of State, responsible for organising an examination in public; it would have to organise one unless the Secretary of State directed otherwise. Matters that the RPB thought should be examined or those directed by the Secretary of State would be considered. I note that the amendment is modelled on the provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which requires a local planning authority to cause an inquiry or other hearing for proposals for the alteration or replacement of plans. However, it is important to remember that the regional spatial strategy is the Secretary of State's policy and it is therefore right that responsibility for an examination in public should rest with him. Placing that responsibility on the RPB instead would not be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 136, 138 and 139 would restrict the Secretary of State's discretion on whether an examination in public should be held. Amendments
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
Nos. 136 and 138 would remove entirely the Secretary of State's discretion on whether an examination in public were held. The effect would be to require an examination in all cases, even for the most minor revisions to regional spatial strategy, so I cannot agree to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points made by the hon. Members for Cotswold and for Ludlow. The hon. Member for Ludlow asked what is meant by the phrase
	<br><q><p>"the level of interest shown in the draft".</p></q>
The answer is one of common sense. If there have been only very few representations and they have said that there has been little to object to, the Secretary of State may decide that an examination is not necessary. However, that would depend on the particular circumstances with regard to the revision of the regional spatial strategy. I repeat that the proposals are common sense. The ethos and content of the Bill are in favour of transparency and community involvement—I think that I have laboured that point almost to death.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not see in the local plan process a huge disparity in treatment? As I understand it, every local plan document will have to be subject to an independent examination, yet the Secretary of State may or may not decide to have an independent examination of the regional plan, which, as we discussed earlier, could have huge implications for people's lives. There is a huge disparity between the two plan-making processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the words of Ministers as recorded in 	<i>Hansard</i> are taken reasonably seriously. My words have been absolutely clear in their intent. The Bill is clear in its intent, which is in favour of the greatest reasonable involvement of the public in drawing up the regional spatial strategy and all the local development documents. I do not know what more to say, other than this: the hon. Gentleman chooses a literal interpretation of the wording of the Bill and talks about the potential arbitrary, almost despotic, response of a potential Secretary of State. The intent, ethos and character of our exchanges have demonstrated that that would not occur, but if it did there would be a variety of recourses in the public domain to challenge any such procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured by the tone of what the Minister says, but I do not want him to sit down before he has discussed the words
	<br><q><p>"such other matters as he thinks appropriate."</p></q>
If he thinks that there may be things he cannot foresee in respect of paragraphs (a) to (c), but that they might come up in future, would it not be more appropriate for there to be provision for regulations allowing him to have regard to other things? As it is, the words
	<br><q><p>"such other matters as he thinks appropriate"</p></q>
will receive no scrutiny at any point. I am a bit concerned that the clause is out of line with the tone of the rest of the Bill, in which he leaves room for regulations should new factors come in. In this example, he is not leaving it to regulations—it is entirely down to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me remind the hon. Gentleman of the criteria set out in clause 6(4), which stipulate the considerations to which the Secretary of State must have regard when deciding whether to arrange for an examination to be held:
	<br><q><p>"(a) the extent of the revisions proposed by the draft … (b) the extent"</p></q>
and nature of
	<br><q><p>"consultation on the draft before it was published"</p></q>
and
	<br><q><p>"(c) the level of interest shown in the draft".</p></q>
The last paragraph refers to
	<br><q><p>"such other matters as he thinks appropriate".</p></q>
The hon. Gentleman alleges that the Secretary of State can think that any matter is important and therefore has carte blanche to make whichever decision he wishes. However, the Secretary of State must always take account of paragraphs (a) to (c)—the first three criteria—so it is not true to say that clause 6(4)(d) gives him carte blanche. The Secretary of State must act reasonably, as I am sure any Labour Secretary of State would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way again. I have no doubt that he would act reasonably, and he is beginning to reassure me. It might be helpful if he made it clear whether if there were a significant "level of interest" in the draft, as in clause 6(4)(c), and there had not been as much consultation as would be carried out in other regions, anything else would be insignificant and the Secretary of State would feel, on the ground of reasonableness, that he would have to have a public examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is scraping the barrel. Before I respond to that, let me deal with the suggestion that there is a disparity in treatment regarding development plan documents, which will always be subject to an examination in public. The representations made on a draft RSS revision will always be considered by the Secretary of State. The question is, does he need an examination in front of a panel to help him?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we are dealing with issues raised by hon. Gentlemen, another thought has sprung into my head. The hon. Member for Ludlow asked about factors that the Secretary of State cannot foresee and about the Secretary of State not having the power to make regulations. The answer to that, it appears, is that he needs to make a reasonable decision at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's suggestion would mean that regulations would have to be made for a particular case, and might not then be relevant to all cases. Such regulations may take something—time—and may come too late to apply to a specific decision. Frankly, I could not have put it better myself. Let me go on with my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These criteria are entirely sensible and appropriate for making such a decision. In addition, draft PPS11 states that there is a strong presumption that an examination in public will be held. The Secretary of State may decide that an examination is unnecessary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
only in the exceptional circumstances of a minor revision, and subject to the criteria that I cited earlier. It should not surprise the hon. Gentleman that, to date, the Secretary of State has never decided that a public examination is not warranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, amendment No. 139 would represent an unwarranted reduction in the Secretary of State's discretion. It would prevent him from taking other matters into account, beyond those in the Bill at clause 6(4), as he sees appropriate, when deciding whether to hold an examination in public. That seems unhelpful: we do not have particular matters in mind but the views of regional stakeholders, for example, might be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 75 is a small but important amendment reflecting the importance that we attach to consultation within the regional planning process. It makes it clear that the Secretary of State must consider the nature, as well as the extent, of the consultation undertaken by the regional planning body. That focus on the quality as well as the quantity of consultation is reflected in the draft regulations to part 1 of the Bill and PPS11. I hope that the hon. Member for Ludlow will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been trying hard and the hour is late. He is incredibly reasonable and I am sure that under his stewardship, there would be always be an examination in public, but I can foresee circumstances in which an individual, a group of individuals or perhaps even an entire local planning authority was unhappy with the regional spatial plan, particularly—reverting to the issue that we debated before the tea break—on the allocation of numbers of houses. I can foresee circumstances in which a different Secretary of State would take a fairly cavalier attitude, decide not to hold an independent examination and get away with it under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point but I shall quote clause 19(1) on the local plan procedure:
	<br><q><p>"The local planning authority must submit every development plan document"—</p></q>
some of those will be fairly small—
	<br><q><p>"to the Secretary of State for independent examination."</p></q>
There must be an independent examination; there is no discretion in that case. Some of those are really petty matters, whereas the regional spatial strategy is a hugely important document, affecting people's lives greatly. There is a disparity in the Bill. I would not be surprised if others in another place wanted to come back to this. I cannot understand why, if the Minister is so certain that there will be consultation and an independent examination, he will not accept a change of wording in the Bill to that extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One frustration with the debate arose when the Minister read from draft PPS11. He said:
	<br><q><p>"There is a strong presumption that an examination-in-public will be held and it is only in exceptional circumstances of a minor revision and subject to the criteria set out in clause 6(4) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill that the Secretary of State may decide an examination is unnecessary."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
If the Minister had responded to the debate immediately and reassured us with that significant and strong statement, which would have been on the record, many of the interventions would have been unnecessary. It is frustrating, although only a minor gripe, that in PPS11, the statement is not under the heading of "The Examination-in-Public", which is what we are talking about, but towards the end of the section headed "Submission of the Draft Revision to the Secretary of State". If I had known that, I could have avoided tabling the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that statement, more than anything else that he said, the Minister has reassured me that the system will work in that there will be examinations in public in all but the most exceptional circumstances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment No. 141, in

	<br><q><p>'(3) The person appointed by the Secretary of State shall decide who will appear in person at the examination in public.'.</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although amendment No. 140 is the first in this group, it follows from the amendments in the previous group. As I accepted the Minister's assurance then, to save time I accept them in this case. I am not particularly interested in amendment No. 140 now, but I am interested in the Minister's response to amendment No. 141, because it would ensure that there was an opportunity for objectors to a draft revision of the RSS to be heard. The RSS may be more site specific than the existing regional planning guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Minister said earlier that the RSS was not intended to be particularly site specific but it could be more so than the existing regional planning guidance, and it could have an effect on individual
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
property owners. It is essential that they should have the right to state their objections in a proposal to the RSS. If that is not allowed, there is the possibility of legal challenge under the Human Rights Act 1998, on the grounds that the individual has not had the opportunity of a fair hearing of their objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide a caveat, that the person appointed by the Secretary of State shall decide who will appear in person at the examination in public. That is to allow the inspector to decide that not every person with objections could be heard in public if they are essentially the same objections. I am trying to be reasonable, and not to allow an objector's charter, to use that horrible phrase again. In respect of that clarification, because the RSS could be more site specific than the existing regional planning guidance, there may be need for compliance with the Human Rights Act to allow individuals to be heard. The best person to decide that is the inspector, who is appointed by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely follow the hon. Gentleman. Amendment No. 140 was more or less dealt with in the previous discussion, but amendment No. 141 deserves a little more discussion, particularly in view of the inconsistency of the approach taken by the Minister on the new clause in my name, my proposals for an independent inquiry into local plan documents and the proposals for an independent inquiry relating to the RSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7(3) states:
	<br><q><p>"No person has a right to be heard at an examination in public."</p></q>
Had I spotted that earlier, I would certainly have tabled an amendment to delete it or considerably amend it, because it is totally contrary to everything that the Minister has said in Committee. I hope that he will say that if an amendment to that subsection were tabled on Report, he would be minded to accept it. That said, amendment No. 141, to which the hon. Member for Ludlow spoke, is entirely reasonable. In local plans and the RSS, the person who has the say as to who can appear before the inquiry must be the independent inspector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we have a statement from the Minister, there will almost certainly be a challenge, again under article 6 in respect of the Human Rights Act, which I have quoted to the Committee previously. That makes it clear that every person has a right to appear at an independent inquiry or tribunal. Clause 7(3) must be completely contrary to it. I wonder how the Minister or his boss, the Deputy Prime Minister, will be able to sign the certificate saying that the Bill is human rights compliant, because every Bill that goes through this place must have such a certificate. I think that there will be great difficulty with that while clause 7(3) remains in place, but I await with interest what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the clause because what concerns me is the basis on which the inspector or whoever will decide who can appear. I assume that in this context the word "person" has its wider sense, which includes bodies corporate, rather than the narrower sense of mankind. The great concern that most people feel is that it is the big battalions, not the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
little people, as they sometimes describe themselves, who have the say in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested to know on what basis the Secretary of State anticipates decisions will be made if no one has a right to appear. Will it be some measure of the intensity of their opposition to the proposal under examination or, for that matter, their support for it? Will it be some measure of the extent to which they are affected by a proposal? One can well imagine that an individual will be 100 per cent. affected, whereas the local authority will be affected only in one corner by a similar blob, star or whatever symbols are used on the maps in a regional spatial strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point is extremely pertinent. The RSS will hand down the housing targets and numbers. That is why individuals should be given every opportunity to object to those plans if they want to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I am particularly glad that my hon. Friend used those last few words, because the hon. Member for Ludlow, I think, originated the term "objector's charter" in Committee and I must ask what is wrong with or undemocratic about an objector's charter. Objection to proposals made by Government or quasi-Government bodies is the only power that individuals have. Surely we as the Opposition should be doing our best to support objectors, not to put obstacles in their way, whether the Government are composed of my right hon. and hon. Friends at some point in the next three or four years, or of Labour Members, which is the case at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the function of Back Benchers to protect their constituents—and, by extension, individuals throughout the country—from the Government. It is not our function to assist the Government. Therefore, an objector's charter is exactly what we should be trying to add to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to achieve that by supporting this amendment. I am trying to draw out from the Minister the basis on which people will have the right to object. In fact, they will not have that right—he has said that they will not have the right, at least to express their objection in a meaningful sense in front of an inspector. What rights do they have? How will the Minister decide?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my fellow Back Benchers and I want to do our jobs properly, we should promote an objector's charter. If that were to stand in the way of change, I would simply say, "All change is for the worse"—I am unsure whether I have quoted Lord Eldon or my illustrious predecessor the Duke of Wellington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the unfortunate originator of the term objector's charter in this Committee, I say to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a lively little debate, and I will address some of the detail of it in due course. The hon. Member for Ludlow is right that amendment No. 140 covers the same ground as amendments Nos. 136 and 138. I am glad that he agrees. There is no point in rehearsing the discussion about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will begin by challenging the premise of the hon. Gentleman's arguments in support of amendment No. 141. He asserted that the regional spatial strategy may be more site specific than RPG and could affect individual property owners. That is wrong. PPS11 makes it clear that the regional spatial strategy should not be site specific. I will elaborate on that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 141 would be to remove the provision that no one has the right to be heard at the examination in public, and instead to specify that the person appointed by the Secretary of State should decide who will appear in person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight was most agitated. He seemed to be offering a prescription for obstructionism not to the Government but to local planning authorities, whose administrations are of a variety of party-political hues. His remarks would not be welcomed in those few authorities that are administered by the Conservative party. My own authority is administered by a Lib Dem-Tory coalition. We have seen plenty of that kind of collusion in the course of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Uncharacteristically, the Minister is being unkind to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can take it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can take it; we can all take it. However, it was worth pointing that out for the record. Not for the first time, the Minister is adopting an inconsistent approach. Surely, if he was arguing in vigour, as he was, that everybody has a right to appear in person at every inspection of every local plan document, it must be right that everybody who wants to do so may appear in person for a much more important plan, the regional spatial strategy. He cannot have it both ways. That would be totally inconsistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really and truly believe that the hon. Gentleman has got it wrong in this regard. Local plans will impinge far more directly on individuals than regional spatial strategies, which are, by definition, of a broad, strategic nature. As I have said repeatedly and mean to say again, they will not be site specific. To that extent, although I accept that any individual may have a view about the overall strategy being articulated in the RSS, at the same time there will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>399</span>
not be the direct material interest that justifies the rights of an individual to attend the examination in public of a local development plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I have lost the plot. Since when has a material interest been the criterion according to which somebody can object to a local plan? I have never heard of that concept before. Let me give the Minister an example of why I think that he is wrong. Let us suppose that one of my constituents who lives in the Cotswold area of natural beauty wanted to object to the number of houses that were being imposed on the Cotswold authority that, because of planning designations, would have to go into areas that were not designated as an area of natural beauty. He would have a perfectly good reason—it would cause a big change to the area—if he wanted to object to the RSS giving the Cotswolds that number of extra houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have conceded that an individual might have a broad view about the contents of an RSS and might wish to make representations. There is nothing in the provisions to preclude that individual from being heard. It is just that there is not an axiomatic right for him to be heard in these matters. Let me continue, and then I shall answer some of the issues raised by Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our conviction that the amendment would not enhance the drafting of the Bill. Notwithstanding the libertarian protestations of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, our proposals pursue time-honoured arrangements established by Conservative Governments of the past, in common with the arrangements for current, non-statutory RPG and structure plans. An examination in public into draft revisions to RSS will not be an examination of all the submitted proposals, nor will it be a hearing of all representations. That is appropriate, I repeat, because the purpose of an RSS is to provide a broad development strategy for the region rather than to identify specific sites for development in which individuals might have a direct interest. Therefore, we do not consider it necessary for there to be a right to be heard at the examination. The Bill needs to be clear on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now and will continue to be for the person appointed by the Secretary of State to select the participants at the examination in public. That is made clear by draft PPS11 and there is no need to say so in the Bill. I therefore urge hon. Gentlemen to withdraw their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for his courtesy in giving way. Could I posit a contrary case? We have already established that housing will be controversial when we put these measures into practice. I shall give a different example. Let us say that in a regional spatial strategy with transport as part of its overall purview there is a proposal to build a new motorway. The motorway will travel across several counties in the region, and a proposed route has been included in broad terms in the strategy. Many people could be directly affected by the proposal, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
they would want to make representations about the RSS to an inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take another example, let us say that the RSS includes a proposal to expand a regional airport. Many thousands of people could be affected by that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I call Mr. Hill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a perfectly fair point. In such circumstances, it would be a reasonable expectation that such interested individuals would appear at the examination. In fact, we are not discussing a denial of the right to appear but simply a requirement that not every person will have the right to appear on the basis of having made a representation. That is absolutely in accordance with existing practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the distinction that the Minister makes, but given that these will be regional public inquiries—if I can use that idiom—has the Minister considered the many people who would feel that they had a strong reason for making a representation? The scale of the inquiry could be very large and the duration very long to allow people to feel that they had had a fair bite of the cherry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that that is potentially the case. Let me set out for the benefit and, I hope, the satisfaction of the hon. Gentleman the guidance on the selection of participants. For the general information of the Committee, paragraph 18 states that
	<br><q><p>"the choice of participants will flow from the matters selected for examination. The main criterion for selecting participants will be the significance of the contribution they can be expected to make to the discussion, having regard to their knowledge and expertise and/or the views they have already expressed. The Panel will ensure it does not invite so many participants as to preclude meaningful debate."</p></q>
That seems entirely sensible, and the hon. Member for Cotswold should go along with it. It would be reasonable to assume that the cases identified by the hon. Member for Rayleigh would fall into the category of those who have a significant contribution to make. Therefore, it would be a reasonable expectation that they would be invited to present evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must curb the Minister on the word "significant". What is significant to one person may be more or less significant to someone else. That is why everyone has the right to be heard at a local planning inquiry. The same principle should apply in this case. Some people are more intelligent than others, and some are more articulate. Regardless, if they feel something strongly, they ought to have the right to be heard whether or not their contribution is significant. Clause 7(3) states:
	<br><q><p>"No person has a right to be heard at an examination in public."</p></q>
That is a denial of some people's human rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where the hon. Gentleman is coming from. In an earlier debate, he was completely against the right of every person making a representation to be heard, but now he is telling us that everybody should be heard. The hon. Gentleman alluded to human rights. Let me just say that an RSS would not contain policies that were site specific. Therefore, it would not affect an individual's property rights. To that extent, there is no conflict with the Human Rights Act. Indeed, the Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>401</span>
would not introduce legislation that was in conflict with that Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way again. To return to my earlier example, which he was kind enough to admit had some validity, if someone builds a motorway that runs along the bottom of one's property, that undeniably affects one's property rights. The point that I am trying to get across to the Minister is that given some of the inquiries into county structure plans that there have been in the past, an inquiry into the regional spatial strategy of a region with, say, six counties would produce, in effect, six county structure plan inquiries rolled into one. This will be a mammoth exercise, which could affect millions of people, especially given some of the examples of roads or airports that I was trying to cite. Have the Government fully thought through the scale of that undertaking, the resources that would be required to do the thing properly and the time that it would take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman waxes most eloquent, but I fear that he has chosen a bad example. Motorways and trunk roads are subject to a separate statutory inquiry under the highways legislation. The issue will simply not arise in connection with the RSS. I rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister's advisers advise him that the RSS will not be any more site-specific than the existing regional planning guidance, who am I to say that they are wrong? They probably have more legal brains than I do, so if they are confident that they will not end up with challenges under the Human Rights Act, it is on the Government's head if they have got it wrong. I have listened to what the Minister said. It really comes down to whether or not the legal advice is correct. If it is, the Government have nothing to worry about. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would ensure that the elected regional assembly or, if one is not present, the Secretary of State, gives reasons for disagreeing with the recommendations of the inspector who held the examination in public on the draft revision of the RSS. The elected regional assembly or, if one is not present, the Secretary of State, has the right under the clause to override the recommendations of the inspector who held the examination in public on the draft revision of an RSS, in much the same way in which the Secretary of State has the powers to override a planning inspector's decisions in any inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires the Secretary of State to publish any changes that he proposes to make to the draft and his reasons for doing so. However, he is not required to give reasons for his disagreeing with the inspector's recommendations. I assume that the Minister intends that to be included in the Bill. My reading of the clause may be wrong, and it may already be included. If it is not, however, the amendment would tidy up the wording of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 would ensure that any changes to a draft RSS proposed by the elected regional assembly or, if one is not present, the Secretary of State, to which there are objections, may also be reviewed by an examination in public. The Secretary of State can require the draft revision of an RSS to be subject to examination in public. However, there is no equivalent for an examination in public of any changes that the Secretary of State proposes to make to the draft, whether or not an examination in public has been held on it. If the Secretary of State makes substantive changes following changes to the draft, there is no requirement for there to be public consultation on those changes. I am sure that the Minister will say that that is because he has to be reasonable all the time. Frankly, there is no come back here. Essentially the amendment would ensure that members of the public have as much opportunity to be heard on the proposal of the elected regional assembly or the Secretary of State on the draft revision as they will on the regional planning body's initial draft revision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 144 is designed to ensure that the elected regional assembly or the Secretary of State give their reasons for decisions about the revision of the regional spatial strategy. Clause 8 requires the Secretary of State to publish reasons for any changes that he proposes to make to the draft revision of the RSS. That duty to give reasons should also apply when the Secretary of State publishes the final revision and when he withdraws the draft revision of the RSS. Again, I hope that these amendments clarify the actions of the Secretary of State. I would struggle to imagine that the Minister could disagree with their intention. As usual, I will probably be told that they are entirely unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Allow me, Mr. Hurst, to remind the Committee of the purport of the amendments.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>403</span>
Amendment No. 142 would require the Secretary of State to publish any recommendation of the person appointed to hold the examination that he proposed to reject. Amendment No. 143 would require the Secretary of State, when considering representations on proposed changes to draft revisions, to reconstitute the examination in public where necessary. Amendment No. 144 would require an elected regional assembly to give reasons for any changes that it has made to an RSS after the examination in public or if it proposes to withdraw a draft RSS. The duty would fall on the Secretary of State if there were no elected regional assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I explain what will happen with the report of the person holding the examination and any changes that the Secretary of State proposes to make to the draft revision of the RSS prepared by the RPB. People and bodies that make representations on the RPB's draft revision are likely to propose a wide variety of changes. The examination will consider the most important issues raised. Clause 8(2) requires the Secretary of State to consider not only the report of the person appointed, but those representations that that person has not considered, so his proposed changes will be influenced by more than just the recommendations in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the examination will certainly be published. Both the Secretary of State and the RPB must publish any changes that the Secretary of State proposes to make under the regulations for part 1 of the Bill. That comes in regulation 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he must take account of representations that the inspector has not taken into account. Does he have to or is he entitled to reconsider representations that the inspector has taken into account? May he only consider the inspector's report on those representations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman repeat that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Secretary of State was entitled to take account of representations that the inspector had not taken into account. I asked whether the Secretary of State is entitled to take account of representations that the inspector has taken into account or is he merely entitled to take account of the inspector's report on those representations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first part of the choice that the hon. Gentleman posed is yes. That is for the record. If there is likely to be a long delay between the submission of the report and the publication of proposed changes, the report may be published at the same time, as people will want to know what changes are made in the light of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(3) requires the Secretary of State to publish his proposed changes and reasons. Under the proposed regulations, the Secretary of State and the RPB are required to publish not only an explanation of the changes made, but decisions not to make changes recommended in the report. The Secretary of State will also send these changes and reasons to statutory consultees and others who made representations on the RPB's draft revision. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>404</span>
regulations also provide for comments to be made on the Secretary of State's proposed changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the consultation on the proposed changes, the Secretary of State will issue final revision to the RSS. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Forgive me, Mr. Hurst, it is that time in the Committee's proceedings when I must collect myself. The Bill, regulations and the procedural policy and guidance set in draft PPS11 on regional planning provide robust and transparent arrangements for the process. It should already be clear why amendment No. 142 is not necessary. I wish in many respects that I could sit down now, but I am aware that I also need to address amendment No. 143.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 is about having a further examination in public to look at representations on the Secretary of State's proposed changes. I do not agree with that approach for two reasons. First, most of the changes that the Secretary of State will propose will flow from the appointed person's report. The presumption is that the Secretary of State will amend the draft RSS revision in accordance with that report, unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. Other, more minor changes may arise from representations that are not considered in the report. If the changes arise from the report, the issues will already have been considered at the examination. Therefore, representations on proposed changes will normally be in relation to matters already considered at the examination and will thus not need a further examination; or, if the representations arise in relation to the more minor changes, they are likely to be more minor, not warranting an examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a further examination into the same proposed changes may not be the most sensible way to proceed in the unlikely event that a major new issue arises after the Secretary of State's proposed changes have been published. An example might be the emergence of a radically different regional economic strategy produced by the regional development agency. If that happens, the Secretary of State will need to consider whether a further round of consultation can accommodate it, or whether the change is so fundamental that the regional planning body will need to produce a new draft revision. If the latter, clause 8(7) provides for the Secretary of State to withdraw the draft revision. The regional planning body would be able to look at the proposals in the light of the new information and prepare a new draft revision, which can then go through the examination process afresh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already dealt with the reasons for changes, which the first part of amendment No. 144 raises. The second part would require the Secretary of State, where there was no elected regional assembly, to give reasons for withdrawing a draft RSS. The approach that we have adopted throughout parts 1 and 2 of the Bill is that for the more significant, substantive powers of the Secretary of State, it is right to place in the Bill a duty to give reasons. For example, when the Secretary of State proposes any changes to a draft revision of the RSS, he must give his reasons why, under clause 8(3). That is important because the final published version will form part of the development plan. Given the significant substantive nature of those powers, it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
appropriate for the giving of reasons to appear in the Bill. In addition, if anyone is aggrieved by the policies in an RSS revision or the reasons given for it, they can challenge the validity of the revision under clause 78.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Secretary of State decides to withdraw a draft revision, it is essentially procedural, and it is unnecessary to publish the reasons in the Bill. That is similar to the current provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, whereby the Secretary of State has various powers of direction for which there is no statutory requirement to give reasons. For example, he has no statutory requirement to give reasons when he calls in proposals in a local plan for his approval under section 44, although it is our policy that the Secretary of State would provide reasons, unless they were obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any exercise of those powers could be challenged by way of judicial review, and any arbitrary exercise of power would risk a successful challenge. For those reasons, any Minister would sensibly explain why he was exercising the power. As I have explained, the Government seek to provide reasons for their decisions, as a matter of good practice. The amendment understandably seeks safeguards around the exercise of the power to withdraw. However, there are sufficient safeguards within our system of administrative law and practice, which make it unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were not obvious why the draft revision was being withdrawn, consideration would be given to publishing the reasons why. Nevertheless, I undertake to the Committee to reconsider whether we need to clarify that point in the final version of PPS11 and possibly provide for it in regulations, as we have when the RPB withdraws a draft revision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that I have burdened the Committee with a lengthy response but these are serious matters. I urge the hon. Member for Ludlow to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a full and cogent response to amendments Nos. 143 and 144.

	<br><q><p>clause 10, page 6, line 13, at end insert—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>'(ba) requirements about inspection by the public of a draft revision or any other document;'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 76 to 78 and 91 to 94.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my pleasure to move the amendment, which concerns the Secretary of State's powers to make regulations governing the application of parts of the new arrangements for regional and local planning under parts 1 and 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 76 would make express provision for regulations that set out requirements about inspection by the public of a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy or any other document. Amendment No. 92 is the equivalent for local development documents or any other documents under part 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our main aims in the reforms is to secure effective and robust opportunities for the public to engage with the new planning system, and the amendments help to achieve that. We have set out in draft the regulations that we intend to make. The provisions will ensure that there is consistency across the country to a reasonable standard based on current good practice. The public and others with an interest can have confidence in the new arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 77 and 93 provide for regulations under clauses 10 and 35 respectively to determine the time at which actions must be performed. The amendment is intended to provide proper flexibility to regional planning bodies and local planning authorities to move forward quickly the preparations of draft revisions to the regional spatial strategy and local development documents while safeguarding people's rights to be involved. The provisions cover the time at which representations on a draft revision of an RSS must be made. The RPB can determine that time, which must be not less than 12 weeks or, where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that a draft revision constitutes a minor amendment to the RSS, not less than six weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 78 and 94 would allow RPBs and local planning authorities to make a reasonable charge for providing copies of documents that they are required to publish under parts 1 and 2 of the Bill or by regulation. As is currently the case, it is sensible that RPBs and local planning authorities should be able to recoup at least part of the costs of publishing documents should they choose to do so. Amendments Nos. 91 and 95 are simply intended to ensure consistency between parts 2 and 6 of the Bill. Amendment No. 91 would create a power in clause 35 for regulations to set up procedures for the preparation of local development documents. There is already such a power in part 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 95 provides for regulation under clause 71 to establish the detail of the nature and extent of consultation with and participation by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2002-2003V001P0I1035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 79, in
	<br><q><p>clause 11, page 6, line 33, at end insert—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>'() The Secretary of State is the Secretary of State for the time being having general responsibility for policy in relation to the development and use of land.'.</p></q>
Clause 1(2) requires the RSS to set out the Secretary of State's policies, however they are expressed, in relation to the development and use of land in the region. Amendment No. 79 prevents clause 1(2) from requiring policies prepared by any other Secretary of State to be included in the RSS if those policies relate to the development and use of land within the region. It has always been the intention that the RSS should set out the policies of the Secretary of State with general policy responsibility for planning, and not the policies of, for example, the Secretary of State for Health or the Secretary of State for Transport that relate to but are not primarily about land use or development. The amendment ensures that there is no confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we dispose of clause 11, I would like to probe the Minister on what is meant by clause 11(2), which states:
	<br><q><p>"But the Secretary of State may by order direct that if the area of a National Park falls within more than one region it is treated as falling wholly within such region as is specified in the order."</p></q>
It just so happens that the Peak District national park falls in four different regions. I wondered what criteria the Minister will use when making such an order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. The clause enables the Secretary of State by order to direct that a national park that falls within more than one region is to be treated as falling within the regions specified in the order. That is necessary to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
ensure that all strategic policies relating to a national park area can be found in one place rather than fragmented among different regional spatial strategies. As to the criteria that will be employed to identify the region within which the interests of the national park will be expressed, I shall undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman setting out those criteria. I am grateful to him for having raised the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 11, as amended ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Keith Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hurst. I am delighted to be able to raise this point of order to express my thanks to a range of persons in the Committee. First, on behalf of the entire Committee I express our thanks to you and to your colleagues for their excellent, wise and tolerant chairmanship. I also express a genuine word of thanks for their support, not least their patience, during the proceedings. I offer a particular word of thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark), the Government Whip on the Committee, and I would like to extend that to all the usual channels involved in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like to express my thanks to the Opposition. I thank both parties for their courtesy, open-mindedness and generosity towards myself in a variety of circumstances, and I thank them for the extremely serious and responsible way in which they have contributed to our proceedings. I express the thanks of the Committee to the Clerks, who have served us well, the 	<i>Hansard</i> Reporters, the Badge Messengers and the police officers who have supervised our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I express my thanks to the silent ones—those who officially do not exist, but without whom a Minister would in reality scarcely exist, or at least not for very long. They have proved a consistent inspiration throughout the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hurst. I wish to associate myself with all the Minister's remarks. I would also like to say that it is very nice to see that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton did manage to turn up today for the second time. I thank my colleagues for their contributions, particularly the silent one, my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh, although he was not so silent at times. He made some very good points. I would also like to thank you, Mr. Hurst, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Pike, for all your forbearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to thank the Minister. He has almost always—apart from the odd occasion when we pushed him to the limit—behaved with courtesy and great generosity in giving way. I would also like to thank the Clerks. They have been unfailingly helpful over a long period of time, and have had a huge work load. I would like to thank 	<i>Hansard,</i> and the Badge Messengers and the police for keeping us all safe. Let us hope that we get this Bill on to the statute book—although having said that, I am sure that it will need a little more amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
