<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the key clauses in the Bill, in that the Government have indicated that they hope this proposal will help reduce the prison population.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to explain a little more fully than he has done in previous discussions why he and the Home Office believe there has been such a steep increase in the prison population in the past two months. It is even steeper than is normal in January and February. There were 43,764 people in prison at the last count—42,166 at the end of January, whereas there were only 40,800 in December, far fewer than there are today. This seems to be an extraordinary increase—almost 3,000—in two months. The Minister and the Home Office must surely have considered the reason for this, especially as the increase follows several months of exhortations by the Home Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice and this House, to the courts to take into consideration the excessive prison population.<br><br>
We were all hoping that fewer, not more, people would be sentenced to prison. Lodking at these figures it is not possible to say that the judges have undergone a change of heart. On the contrary, un
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
less there is some explanation we have not yet heard, they seem to be sentencing more people to prison than before. I am always disappointed every time I hear Lord Justice Lawton make an utterance on television, because he believes that every first-time house breaker should be locked away, as he puts it. This serves to undermine all the exhortations of the Home Secretary and the Lord Chief Justice—and of Parliament—to try to think in other ways.<br><br>
During the prison officers' strike there was a significant reduction in the prison population and there was no evidence of risk to public safety, but we had a far lower prison population. No very clear explanation of why there was that reduction has been given. There could be several factors, but I think we should learn from that, first, that it is possible to get the figure down and, secondly, that when the figure was down when the strike was on, there was apparently no risk to public safety.<br><br>
We are all agreed that under the Bill the hope is to obtain a significant and permanent reduction in the prison population—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Lady mean by the phrase " We all believe " the purpose of this Bill to be? This is a Criminal Justice Bill, not an administration of prisons (executive convenience) Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking for my hon. Friends and, I believe, the Minister who is in charge of the Bill. I repeat what I said. We all want a significant and permanent reduction in the prison population and we hope the Bill may help to bring this about. If the Minister wants to deny that, I am sure he will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite capable of speaking for myself. I have done so at great length in the course of the proceedings and no doubt will do so again.<br><br>
If the hon. Lady looks at <i>Hansard,</i> she will find that she said, no doubt through a slip, that the purpose of this Bill is to bring about a permanent reduction. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) was absolutely right in saying that that was an inaccurate way to express the purpose of the Bill. We all hope, of course, that it will be possible within the framework of a properly constituted system of criminal justice to bring down the prison population. That is rather different from what she was saying. My hon. Friend, with his customary accuracy, was simply pointing that out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all want, except for the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark), to see a permanent and significant reduction in the prison population. I got the impression from the hon. Gentleman that he did not even want to see that particularly. However, I think that is the common —desire of the rest of the Committee, and if it can be obtained through this Bill we should work towards it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, in common with the majority of the people of the country, do not wish to see a reduction in the prison population as an abstraction standing on its own right. We wish to see a reduction in the crime rate and control of the committing and expression of criminal activity. If, following on that, the prison population should be reduced, naturally we would welcome it because it follows on the real purpose of this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would also like to see a reduction in the crime rate and control of criminal activity. The difference between my hon. Friends and the hon. Gentleman seems to be that we do not automatically regard prison sentences as the way towards that objective. Many Conservative Members seem to think that the only solution to that problem is to put people in prison.<br><br>
The history behind this clause is rather chequered because similar provisions already exist in the Criminal Law Act, including a provision which, I believe, was inserted at the instigation of the Minister himself and accepted by a Labour Minister that provision, though, has not been used and the Minister's predecessor at the Home Office said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The difficulty in introducing the measure immediately is that it is difficult to know the impact that it would have on the prison population. Even if accurate forecasts of the overall impact cannot be obtained, there is reason to believe that it would increase the number of prisoners detained for short periods." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 December 1979; vol. 975, c. 1519.]</p></blockquote>
That is what the right hon. and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) said about that provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady is going back and investigating what was said about section 47 of the Criminal Law Act, would she care to comment on what was said on Report by her colleague in the Home Office with responsibility for the Act at that time? He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Fears have been expressed that the new form of sentence will lead not to a diminution in the prison population but to an expansion. I strongley believe that the opposite will be true." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 July 1977; vol. 935, c. 462-3.]</p></blockquote>
That is what the Minister said when introducing the new clause. What does the hon. Lady say about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That fact remains that neither the last Labour Government nor this Government have so far implemented the provision. It is there but it has not been used. We must consider whether we want to use a similar, but not identical, provision. The Opposition have been more sympathetic towards an alternative procedure—that is, automatic parole after, for example, a third of the sentence has been served, if the sentence was for less than three years.<br><br>
That was also publicly canvassed by the Government until quite recently. It was not clear to the general public what consultations, official or unofficial, were taking place with judges, but it was implied that this provision could not be adopted because the judges had given the impression that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
to adopt it would result in an increase in the length of sentences, not a reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon <span class='memberconstituency'>(York) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that it was not clear what consultation took place. Perhaps she did not see " Panorama " last week, when Fred Lewton blew the gaffe. The senior judges of the Court of Appeal were consulted by the Lord Chief Justice and they voted him down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did see " Panorama ". I am saying that it is not clear in the sense that no official statement about these consultations has been produced by the Government or by the judiciary. We have to learn about them from " Panorama ", which is not exactly a satisfactory way of finding out how legislation is drawn up. No one has told us officially of such consultations. We have simply read of them in the press and seen them on television. If there were no' consultations, no doubt the Minister would tell us, but that is why this alternative procedure has not been included in the Bill.<br><br>
We have these proposals in the Bill which are similar to those which have been on the statute book but have not been renewed. Here again, the Minister was quoted in the <i>Guardian</i> on 19 January as saying that he was taking a gamble and that:
<br><blockquote><p>" it is an informed guess that the new power will be properly used."</p></blockquote>
We do not really have a great deal of solid fact to work on with regard to implementing the clause The proposal in the Bill appears to be an exhortation to the courts that they should not give a partly-suspended sentence unless they are satisfied that a wholly-suspended sentence would be inappropriate. If it is implemented, we can only hope that the courts will take notice of it, but the evidence until now is that they will not.<br><br>
There has been strong criticism of the clause, the main criticism being that it will remind courts of the possibility of imposing partially-suspended sentences which they had otherwise probably rejected from their minds because it has not been implemented either under the last Government or the present Government.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The National Association of Probation Officers has asked for the repeal of that provision. In support of its case, it quotes particularly the " Review of Parole in England Wales " 1981. This was no less a body than the Parole Board which deals with offenders day in and day out, month in and month out. It deals with the sort of sentences that are imposed by courts, and in particular with offenders in prison.<br><br>
The "Review of Parole in England and Wales " said:
<br><blockquote><p>"That section has not been activated because of fears that the new sentence would be used to give a ' taste of imprisonment' in cases where at present the courts would impose a fully suspended sentence or a non-custodial sentence."</p></blockquote>
The report continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Inevitably, too, in a proportion of cases, the suspended part of the sentence would be subsequently activated. Thus
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
there can be no certainty that implementing Section 47 would achieve any reduction in numbers in custody …"</p></blockquote>
The National Association of Probation Officers, after quoting that from the Parole Board, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"As well as increasing the number of serving immediate custodial sentences and the numbers liable to be imprisoned if they breach the suspended part of the sentence, the National Association of Probation Officers fears that length of sentences could increase as sentencers may add a suspended element on top of the length of sentence they would otherwise have been given."</p></blockquote>
I have quoted the National Association of Probation Officers before. It is an extremely responsible body whose view should be taken into careful consideration in our deliberations. The Justices Clerks' Society also holds a similar view about the effect the provision would have on the sentences of courts.<br><br>
Therefore, the opposition to this provision and the doubts about it, including the doubts from the Minister himself who says that it is a gamble and an informed guess—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. May hew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt. I have not made a practice of this so far, but the hon. Lady keeps on talking about my having said that it was a gamble. Anything less than a certainty can be described as being a gamble. If she is expecting me to come forward and say, in circumstances where it would be manifest nonsense, that something that depends upon human reaction is a certainty one way or another, she will be disappointed. I shall always say that it is an uncertainty and, as I hope that a certain result will ensue, it remains in the nature of a gamble. If this is the penalty one pays for an honest expression of the truth, it is something of a deterrent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is in a very sensitive mood this morning. I am simply quoting what he said. I did not comment on it. I quoted what I think was an unfortunate phrase to use, and he is obviously on the defensive about it. It was in <i>The Guardian</i> on 19 January, and if I wish to quote it, I shall quote it, and leave it to Members of the Committee to decide what they think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any discretionary power given to the courts entitling them, say, to sentence up to 14 years is a gamble in the hon. Lady's terms, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of all the opposition that I have quoted—the Parole Board, the Minister's predecessor, the Justices Clerks' Society, the probation officers, the opposition in this Committee—I was hoping that we might have something fairly certain and definite in support of the clause and not be told that it is an informed guess. We are waiting to hear some more factual reasons why we should accept the clause. I look forward to hearing the contributions of my hon. Friends on this key matter. Certainly, as the clause stands at the moment, we would want to vote against its inclusion in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman<span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that this clause is very important part and should stand part of the Bill. My reasons for saying that are that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
quite clearly gives greater discretion to the judiciary and greater flexibility in their sentencing policy.<br><br>
Many of my constituents would be attracted by the idea that the judiciary would have the possibility, under this Bill, of effectively sentencing an offender to as little as 28 days in prison. However, I agree with some of the cautionary sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark), in that I think no aspect of the presentation or the argument for this clause should include the argument that it is a convenient or easy way of reducing the prison population as a goal in itself. This is partly because this would be somewhat objectionable to the great body of my constituents, but mainly because I think it would be unlikely to achieve that for the reasons touched upon by the hon. Lady.<br><br>
I cannot believe for one moment that the policy which the hon. Lady favours—automatic parole after one-third of the sentence has been served—would be a good idea because it would clearly infringe the basic flexibility and discretion which we would all like to see the judiciary have.<br><br>
My main comment is that the Government need to be cautious about the way they explain and present the arguments behind this clause, which broadly I favour. I would like to see continual emphasis put upon the Government's excellent and responsible prison building programme, which I think is the right way to deal with this problem of over-crowding.<br><br>
It is naive to suppose that while on the one hand we would like to see the judiciary given greater discretion and more flexibility, on the other hand it is a reality of life that the judiciary does not live in a vacuum, as Lord Justice Lawton said on television a little while ago, and is to a degree responsive to public opinion at any time.<br><br>
As that is the case, and as we were talking about gambles earlier on, my guess is that in the short term at any rate, this clause might well lead to a net increase rather than a net decrease in the prison population. That is why I am particularly concerned to see that the right arguments are used in its support. Broadly, I support the clause and I think that it should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk<span class='memberconstituency'> (Ormskirk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have already announced by a press release from the Home Office that partially-suspended sentences will be introduced from the twenty-ninth of this month. They have already activated section 47 of the 1977 Criminal Law Act. This Clause simply amends section 47, whereby the minimum period for which a sentence may be partially suspended is reduced from six months to three months.<br><br>
The history of this particular proposal is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) says, that of the hobby horse or pet scheme almost exclusively of the Minister of State. He is probably the only person who can be found to speak in favour of this particular proposal. It was he who forced it upon the last minority Labour Government in an amendment to the Criminal Law Act. As he well knows, neither that Government,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
nor until now the present Government, have seen fit to activate it. The only reason it is to be activated today is because the hon. and learned Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew) has replaced the right hon. and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) at the Home Office.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax has said the right hon. and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby had a much more sensitive and realistic notion of the effects of introducing partially-suspended sentences.<br><br>
Having said that, I acknowledge that the Government's intentions in introducing this proposal are laudable; that they, like the Opposition, wish to see a reduction in the prison population. I am glad to see the Minister nodding assent. Their hope is that courts will actually use the power given in the clause to impose partially-suspended sentences to reduce the length of time that some offenders spend in prison, by allowing part of xhe sentence to be suspended.<br><br>
My fear, the fear of my hon. Friends, and the fear of most organisations and individuals outside this House who have a knowledge of the penal system, is that the opposite will result. Although we all share the intention of reducing the prison population, the fear has been expressed that the introduction of partially-suspended sentences will have precisely the opposite effect, which the Government do not want.<br><br>
Perhaps I should pray in aid of that proposition what was said by Baroness Wootton, who put the case against the partially-suspended sentence very clearly in her book "Crime and Penal Policy", published in 1978. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Although the new power has been welcomed as a useful addition to the sentencer's armoury, it is arguable that it may lead to ' short tastes of prison' being prescribed, perhaps particularly by magistrates' courts in cases in which no imprisonment at all would otherwise have been imposed."</p></blockquote>
She went on to say,
<br><blockquote><p>"One can imagine cases in which one member of a magistrates' bench thinks that an offender should go inside for, say, four months, while one of his colleagues would prefer to impose a CSO,"—</p></blockquote>
a community service order—
<br><blockquote><p>"and another favours a substantial fine. Eventually all agree on four months' imprisonment, half suspended, as an acceptable compromise, although the majority would have preferred a non-custodial penalty."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely the point that lies behind the fears of those who are not as enamoured of xhe partially-suspended sentence as the Minister and the hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman).<br><br>
I am told that in the Crown Court judges often give a great deal of thought—which I am glad to hear—in borderline cases as to the choice between a custodial sentence on the one hand and a suspended or a non-custodial sentence, on the other. The new power will give them a very easy option and compromise on these borderline cases, and therefore I would expect that there would be, as a result, a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
tendency for the court to give partially-suspended sentences instead of taking the bolder and perhaps more appropriate step of providing a fully-suspended or a non-custodial sentence.<br><br>
It is true, I acknowledge, that subsection (4) of the clause tries to guard against this danger by providing that partial suspension should not be used in cases where a suspended sentence is appropriate. However, the existing statutory provision for suspended sentences makes it clear that these should not be used instead of non-custodial penalties. Yet we know from the research carried out by the Home Office that this statutory provision has not prevented suspended sentences from being widely used where non-custodial sentences would otherwise have been imposed.<br><br>
We already have, then, recognition of the fact that already suspended sentences are used where it is more appropriate to use a non-custodial sentence, and that fear that has been expressed by my hon. Friend and myself and others, that the partially-suspended sentence will give rise to even more people in prison seems to be a fairly reasonable one, given the track record of the courts and the past history.<br><br>
The Government are well aware of the danger that the introduction of this proposal will not achieve the results that they want, and will in fact increase the prison poulation. I refer to what the right hon. and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby, who was then Minister of State at the Home Office, said in the House on 13 December 1979. I know that the Minister does not like having these things quoted back at him, but they are important. It was a very clearly, well thought out, Home Office ministerial view at the time, and is therefore worth re-quoting and reiterating. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The difficulty in introducing the measure immediately is that it is difficult to know the impact that it would have on the prison population. Even if accurate forecasts of the overall impact cannot be obtained, there is reason to believe that it would increase the number of prisoners detained for short periods."—[<i>Official Re part,</i> 13 December 1979; Vol. 975, c. 1519.] </p></blockquote>
11 am<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister a clear, specific question which I hope he will be able to answer. Can he tell me what his predecessor meant by
<br><blockquote><p>"there is reason to believe"?</p></blockquote>
What were the reasons that were then available to the Minister of State, and no doubt to his advisers, which he did not share with the House of Commons? What are the reasons that led him to believe that the introduction of the partly-suspended sentence would increase the number of prisoners? Do those reasons apply now? If they do, why are the Government introducing this measure? If they do not apply now, why not? What has changed in the circumstances today, as opposed to those in December 1979 that convinced the right hon. and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby to speak against this proposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the proper time I shall answer the question in full, but would it not be fair to read
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
out what my right hon. and learned Friend said at the beginning of that answer? He said
<br><blockquote><p>"I am in favour of the provision in principle, and I hope that it will be possible to introduce it."</p></blockquote>
At the end he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Therefore, it is wise to examine the May report recommendations before implementing the proposals, which I fully support"— [<i>Official Report,</i> 13 December 1979; Vol. 975, c.1519.] </p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too am in favour of the proposal in principle, and I shall not vote against it. I made that clear on Second Reading and on previous occasions. I share the intention and motivation of the Minister, and his right hon. and learned Friend, that this will reduce the prison population. I hope that will be the consequence of the introduction of this proposal, but I am afraid that I am not as convinced as the Minister is, on the evidence so far made available, that the objectives that he and I and the hon. Member for Carshalton—but not the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) apparently —all share.<br><br>
My quibble is with whether or not that objective will actually be achieved. All I am asking for are the reasons that led the right hon. and learned Gentleman to say "No"? The objectives we all share—the principle we all endorse and support— will not be achieved by this proposal. I think my request is reasonable. Clearly, important evidence was available to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that should now be made available to the Committee so that we can make a considered judgment on this matter.<br><br>
It was not just the right hon and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby who was in favour of the proposal, but had doubts about its efficacy. The Home Office "Review of Parole in England and Wales "—the document published in May 1981— said of section 47 of the Criminal Law Act:
<br><blockquote><p>"That section has not been activated ".</p></blockquote>
These are the words of the Home Office, not mine or those of my hon. Friend. That is the Home Office speaking less than a year ago with the imprimatur of the Home Secretary. The review added:
<br><blockquote><p>"That section has not been activated because of fears that the new sentence would be used to give a ' taste of imprisonment' in cases where at present the courts would impose a fully suspended sentence or non-custodial sentence."</p></blockquote>
It went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Inevitably, too, in a proportion of cases the suspended part of the sentence would be subsequently activated."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely our fear. It continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thus there can be no certainty that implementing section 47 would achieve any reduction in numbers in custody and would not confer any advantage in the treatment of individual offenders."</p></blockquote>
That is in paragraph 58 of the review. It is for this reason, as the Minister knows full well, that bodies such as the Law Society, the National Association of Probation Officers, the Justices' Clerks' Society, and almost Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all, have all said that in their view this measure will not bring
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
about a reduction in the prison population, and that on the contrary it will increase it.<br><br>
A letter dated 12 February from the Law Society has been circulated to every member of the Committee. The Minister is fond of throwing influential, prestigious organisations such as the Law Society at Labour Members. Therefore, I do not think it unreasonable or unfair to throw them back at him once in a while, particularl when it comes down as in this letter, so clearly, straightforwardly, unambiguously and wholeheartedly on this side of the argument and against that propounded by the Minister.<br><br>
The letter says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The other matter which particularly concerns the Committee "—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Law Society's Criminal Law Committee—
<br><blockquote><p>"is the proposal in clause 25 to introduce partly suspended sentences of imprisonment. In the opinion of our Criminal Law Committee, if the magistrates' courts and the Crown Court are given the power to impose partly suspended sentences, the overall effect is likely to be to increase the number of offenders in prison. Virtually all offenders who will be affected by the imposition of a partly suspended sentence will be sent to local prisons which are already grossly overcrowded."</p></blockquote>
It went on to make the point that increases in the numbers sent to prison will arise in two ways.
<br><blockquote><p>"First, more offenders will be sentenced to immediate imprisonment than in the past because courts which might otherwise have passed a wholly suspended sentence will be tempted to give offenders a taste of prison."</p></blockquote>
This is precisely the point I made earlier in relation to the Crown court's attempts to find a compromise between a custodial and a non-custodial sentence. It is precisely the point made by Baroness Wooton in her book. The Law Society went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Second, many offenders who would have been given a short immediate prison term will be given a term, part of which will be suspended. The suspended part is likely to be activated if and when the offender re-offends."</p></blockquote>
It continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"…in the opinion of the Committee, it is wrong in principle for an offender to leave prison with a suspended sentence hanging over his or her head. If the part of the sentence to be served immediately is short, it is unlikely that it will be possible to arrange for an appeal against conviction and/or sentence to be heard before the period of immediate imprisonment has been wholly or substantially served."</p></blockquote>
That argument has not been used so far, but the argument of the principle of an offender leaving prison but having a suspended sentence hanging over his head—this also applies to other elements which are already in existence—is a fair one to raise at this juncture as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful and I apologise for interrupting, but I am even more confused this morning than I usually am —[HON. MEMBERS: "That is difficult."] That is indeed difficult. Did the hon. Gentleman say that he was actually in favour of this principle? If so, what are we all arguing about? Could we not suspend judgment as to whether it will result in more or less people being put in prison and get on with the clause?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We cannot do that. It is very important whether more or less people go to prison. The point I am making is that, in principle, I am in favour of any measure that reduces the prison population. I believe the Government are sincere in their intention that this Bill should result in smaller numbers going to prison, but as the Minister has pointed out, he is not certain that that will be the result.<br><br>
I simply wish to point to those factors that indicate that it may not have the intended result, and to suggest other measures which are certain to lead to a reduction in the prison population.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) may know that there has been a series of estimates of the impact on the prison population of the introduction of partly-suspended sentences. The Government persist in quoting only the more favourable figures based upon the most favourable assumptions, which indicate that at best the measures could reduce the prison population by up to 4,000. They refuse to acknowledge, at least publicly, that on the most unfavourable estimates, which are just as reasonable as their more favourable assumptions, the measure could increase the prison population by 8,000. That is the answer to the intervention of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West. There is that judgment between reducing the prison population by 4,000 or increasing it by 8,000. It is not just a question of simply sitting down and letting things take their natural course which may result in 4,000 fewer or 8,000 more. It makes a great deal of difference, as the hon. Gentleman should know, to every one of those additional 8,000.<br><br>
In truth, neither estimate is realistic. Each one is based on assumptions that are not properly verifiable and I suspect that the real figure is somewhere between the two.<br><br>
It is a gamble with prison numbers, with the odds stacked fairly heavily against the Minister and fairly heavily against any successful reduction in the prison population.<br><br>
The Minister and the Home Secretary have acknowledged that there is no certainty that the prison population will be reduced. They accept that it is a gamble. That is a most remarkable thing to say about the single most important proposal in the Bill, which is designed to reduce the prison population. We are making a fuss because it is to us the most important single measure in the Bill when set alongside the objective of trying to reduce the prison population. It is the one measure of which the Government have been proud and have trumpeted throughout the country as being part of their radical credentials in the Bill. However, it is the one measure about which there is doubt, fear and uncertainty, and about which, in the words of the Minister, there is a gamble.<br><br>
Those feelings arise especially at a time when the Home Secretary is being compelled to use police cells in London to hold prisoners because Brixton and Wormwood Scrubs prisons are over-full, at a time when the prison population has increased by an unparalleled 2,300 in the past six weeks, pushing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
the population up to 43,000 when there is room only for 37,000, at a time when the Home Office inspectorate has talked about the appalling conditions of overcrowding at Gloucester prison, at a time when the prison board of visitors at Strange-ways in Manchester has talked about the dehumanising conditions of overcrowding at Strangeways, and at a time when prisoners at Pentonville, in a message to the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> are threatening violence and sit-downs because of what they refer to as dehumanising conditions. In that context, and bearing in mind the Home Secretary's constantly stated desire to see a large and immediate reduction in the prison population, we are looking for measures that are certain to reduce the numbers in prison, such as early release and many of the measures implied in the clauses and the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and myself on behalf of the all-party Penal Affairs Group.<br><br>
I shall support the Clause. I support the intention behind it and I have no desire or intention to oppose it now. But I do so with great reservations. I hope that it will reduce the prison population but my fear and belief is that it will increase it. I should have preferred the Government to come forward with a clear, more specific, and more certain way of reducing the numbers in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), who is as consistent as he is concise. There are some more positive reasons for supporting the clause which I suspect will have the support of the hon. Gentleman because they are certainly directed to the hope which he expressed in the last few minutes of his address.<br><br>
We are discussing partially suspended sentences. One of the objects of a fully suspended sentence is to mark, with the full severity and seriousness with which society regards the sending of a man to prison, the commission of some offence, notwithstanding that it is felt possible, usually owing to circumstances surrounding the convicted person rather than the offence itself, not to incarcerate him on the assumption that there is no recommission of such an offence during the period of suspension. The benefit of a partially suspended sentence would be that in cases it was felt impossible fully to suspend the sentence, and therefore necessary to send someone to prison, it would nevertheless be felt possible to make that period of imprisonment a short one without giving the impression to society that the period to which he was actually sentenced was particularly short.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I have not done the sums and I shall be corrected if I am wrong, but if the court felt that a sentence of immediate imprisonment was essential and that 12 months was appropriate for that kind of crime— <i>[Interruption.]</i>—I am sorry, Mr. Dean, but I must tell you that I am receiving some most helpful remarks from my hon. Friend the Member for Car-shalton (Mr. Forman) who is a philologist. He keeps passing me messages in German, which I must send back with compliments to his wife, in the hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
that he will actually use them. He will understand the purpose of that comment.<br><br>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who have had to sentence offenders will know that on occasions one cannot escape from having to sentence someone to an actual term of imprisonment. One may feel also that it is difficult to impose a period of less than 12 months, because of the nature of the offence". However, the judge may feel that it is not necessary for the convicted person to remain in prison for the full 12-month period. Here the partially suspended sentence would give the opportunity of marking the severity of the offence, which can be done with the wholly suspended sentence, by insisting on the service of a custodial term but by keeping the person in prison for the minimum period that is considered necessary.<br><br>
I apologise for spelling that out fairly slowly and clearly, but I am comforted to think that not only has my speech been a little shorter than that of my predecessor but that it will waste rather less paper when it comes to be printed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons<span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of the members of this Committee, certainly the Minister and I were present in the Committee Room when section 47 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 had its genesis. The Minister was then in Opposition and the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) was the then Minister of State. The new clause on the amendment paper was, as I recollect, the handiwork of the current Minister of State. That which it proposed was not in the 1977 Bill and one expected the Labour Minister of State to reject it out of hand.<br><br>
The Committee was half full when the new clause was debated. In Committee Government Members normally speak far less than Opposition Members in order not to embarrass Ministers and to enable the Government to get on with the Bill. Suddenly we saw, after the new clause had been moved by the current Minister, the Labour Minister of State —a man usually of sound judgment but not on that day—rise to say that he was accepting the clause. I do not know whether he had consulted his civil servants, but a glance at their faces led me to think that he might not have done so.<br><br>
There was no question, as the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) indicated, of a minority Labour Government being forced to accept the new clause. Clauses in Criminal Justice Bills are seldom the meat of big rebellions and hugh pressures.<br><br>
I was appalled by the Labour Minister's acceptance of the new clause. The <i>Hansard</i> report shows that the only person on the Labour Benches, or on the Conservative Benches, to oppose the Minister's acceptance of the new clause was myself. I opposed it, and I have some recollection of opposing it on Report. I have had something to say at various Questions Time's about the enactment of the clause which I thought was wholly retrograde and extremely damaging. It helped to fill the prisons with people who at that stage should not have been imprisoned.<br><br>
One would have expected rebellion or change of mind on Report on the Criminal Law Bill. However
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
when the Minister had accepted it and the Opposition had tabled it, the only complaint from the Back Benches came from' myself, if I recollect rightly. Certainly there was no Division. It was clear that nothing was done because most Labour Members did not know the details of the Bill and because those who did wanted to be loyal to the Minister, or did not think that there was much in the clause. That is how this clause came into existence as section 47 of the Criminal Law Act.<br><br>
I waited to see whether it would be implemented, and I have no doubt that the officials in the Home Office reasserted themselves to ensure that it did not come into existence. They advised that it should not take effect. From 1977 until now that section has not been implemented, although it was embodied in legislation. When a clause is enacted in 1977 and is not implemented until 1982, that shows more clearly than anything else that there was no confidence in the Home Office in section 47, and that there were people in the Home Office who took the view that it would do more harm than good. Time has passed and we have come full circle. The prisons are full and drastic action is needed. The Government have shirked the drastic action and are looking for something to give the impression that they are dealing with the problem of overcrowding in prisons. Simultaneously with that, there recently emerged in the Home Office as Minister of State by coincidence the very gentleman who moved the new clause, whose brainchild it was. He was a civil lawyer, not a criminal lawyer; a lawyer, no doubt brilliant, but a lawyer without any material or considerable experience in the criminal courts—not a lawyer who had, so far as I am aware, been sitting on the Criminal Bench for years. Suddenly he arrives, charming though he is, as the Minister of State himself, with his new clause from 1977 still not implemented, although enshrined in legislation, and within months we are now having that law implemented with some amendment.<br><br>
I do not want to repeat what other hon. Members have said, and I certainly do not want to take as long as some of them often take in making their point. To encapsulate the argument, the overwhelming independent view is that the clause is likely to put people into prison who would not otherwise be there. The reality is that the judiciary, when trembling between prison and a suspended sentence, where it would in existing conditions come down purely for a suspended sentence, might show a certain amount of toughness by introducing a short, sharp shock effect—a short term of imprisonment, and a period of suspended sentence to follow it.<br><br>
The effect will be that we shall have a lot more short sentences, many more people will go to prison who would otherwise have received a full suspended sentence, and I am delighted that the official Opposition now realise that the acceptance by the Labour Minister in 1977 was a mistake. I entirely agree with the view that they take. When the Committee divides I shall certainly vote against the clause which will do nothing to reduce the pressures on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
prison population, and will put people into prison who should not be there. In my view the genesis of the clause was by accident, its progress is damaging, and I hope that it will never be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs<span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many people have taken much encouragement from the repeated statements by the Home Secretary that he firmly intends to reduce the prison population. When the review of parole was published in May 1981, many of us also took encouragement from the rather imaginative proposals about parole, which would have had the effect, on the best estimates of reducing the prison population at a stroke by some 7,000. That would have relieved much of the intolerable pressure on our prisons up and down the country.<br><br>
I wish to turn to one particular point at issue. The arguments against partly-suspended sentences have been put forward by many hon. Members, and I do not wish to repeat them, except to say that an impressive list of expert bodies and organisations have expressed their doubts about partly-suspended sentences and the likely consequences, other than in the very short term, on the size of the prison population.<br><br>
What puzzles me is that when the review was published it was May 1981, and when the Home Secretary spoke to NACRO in November 1981, he appeared to reverse his policy, because he then announced his wish to introduce partly-suspended sentences. My puzzlement is about what happened between May, when the Home Secretary had one point of view, and November, when he had another.<br><br>
Three events took place between these two dates. One was the Conservative Party conference; the second was the change of Minister; the third was the behaviour of the judiciary. I shall say something about each of these.<br><br>
Clearly, no Opposition Member can know precisely what happened, but the change in the Government's policy in that six-month period is bewildering, to say the least, and certainly inconsistent. It is, by all accounts, true, and is certainly widely believed, that the Home Secretary went through a traumatic experience at the Conservative Party conference, and came back to the Home Office a shaken man.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, come on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister finds it uncomfortable for us to draw attention to this. The Home Secretary came back a shaken man, and had a number of meetings to review the whole thrust of his policies. The Minister may deny that this ever happened. He said on one occasion that I had a very inaccurate mole in the Home Office. I do not have a mole at all, but it is certainly widely believed that the Conservative Party conference was a shattering experience for the Home Secretary, and a very disappointing experience for those of us who had the misfortune to watch it on television. However, it is absolutely clear to most of us that the whole thrust of the Government's policy was at least
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
modified as a result of what happened at the seaside last summer.<br><br>
The second factor is the personality of the Minister. If he denies that the Tory Party Conference had anything to do with the change in the Government's attitude, and if he denies—as I am sure he will—that the pressures of the judiciary had anything to do with it, the only fact that accounts for the change in the Government's policy is the influence of the Minister himself. The change is solely due to the influence of the Minister himself on the Government's policies. He has reversed the views of the Home Secretary, the views of his predecessor, and the views of his hon. Friends who had previously considered this matter, and who subscribed to the basic views put forward in the review of parole.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Thirdly, and this may be another factor, there is the pressure of the judiciary. I cannot help believing that there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that the judiciary made its representations to the Home Office, and suggested that it did not find the idea of short sentences on parole acceptable. That evidence suggests that it threatened that if this proposal on parole was introduced as a way of reducing the prison population, it would circumvent the measure by increasing sentences proportionately. I suggest that with that ultimatum from the judiciary the Home Office capitulated, aided and abetted by the Minister, and the Government dramatically changed their policies.<br><br>
It would be useful if the Minister would come clean and tell the Committee why the Government changed their policies, and if he would say which of the three reasons that I have put forward—or which combination of them—is responsible for this change. The only advocate of the partly-suspended sentence is the Minister himself. Of course, he will get loyal support from his Back Benchers—he tends to demand loyalty from his Back Benchers, and they give it to him—but it is unthinking loyalty and it will not help the Minister to sustain the argument.<br><br>
The weight of opinion is overwhelmingly against the suggestions in the clause. The weight of opinion from all the bodies and organisations that are concerned with this matter holds that partly-suspended sentences are not a good idea. I hope that the Minister can explain the reasons for the alteration in the Government's policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole rather sordid story of this clause has been reiterated several times, not least by the unctuous hypocrisy of the hon. and learned Social Democratic Party Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) who took part in the Committee stage of the Criminal Law Act 1977. However, I would say to him that occasionally in Government it is sometimes one's responsibility to determine whether it is better to save the Bill as a whole even at the cost of conceding something. The Minister at the time took the view that if we had not conceded this particular clause we might not have got the Bill at all in the circumstances then prevailing. On that basis he conceded, but it was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
never his judgment that this was an acceptable form of penal punishment and for that reason it has never been implemented.<br><br>
The only person who thinks it is acceptable is the Minister, and no doubt that is why he looked so upset when my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) spoke in opposition to this proposal. The truth is that it does not really matter whether there has been a history of opposition to it, or a history of support for it. The real issue is whether it is likely to succeed in its objectives. We must first ask what its objectives are. If as the Government now claim, it is the only statutory way they have of reducing the prison population, there is a considerable body of opinion which would oppose that.<br><br>
That is not the way in which it was introduced in the Criminal Law Act. The Minister was arguing then, as his hon. Friends are arguing now, that what it really does is to provide another method of custodial treatment which does not require the courts to pass the full sentence of imprisonment. In that sense it is a firmer guide to custodial sentencing for the judiciary and it provides an alternative to the total sentence.<br><br>
If that is what is required, it seems to me that all that could be provided simply by the judiciary using shorter sentences. They do not need to have the suspended elements included in them. The judiciary could, if it wished, say that it would send people down not for six months but for one month. If the person subsequently re-offends—which is the normal reason for reactivating a suspended sentence —the court could take a judgment about the appropriate sentence on that occasion and would not be bound to include the suspended sentence element.<br><br>
That is really what happened to undermine the whole system of the suspended sentence. The suspended sentence was an attempt to get people out of prison. It was introduced with that object and it failed lamentably, because, although initially it reduced the number of sentences of actual imprisonment, it actually increased the number who went to prison. When there was a breach of the suspended sentence the court almost invariably thought it right to pass a sentence of actual imprisonment. In that situation, the suspended sentence is simply an ag-gravator of imprisonment, and does not in any way diminish the number of sentences of actual imprisonment.<br><br>
If that is the position, all that we need to do is to take a short sentence initially and if it fails, in the sense that the offender comes back before the court, the court can review the circumstances in total of the accused and it does not feel under an obligation to send him away for the rest of the suspended sentence. That is the position that will obtain under this clause. The object of giving the courts an alternative form of custodial sentence is simply to acknowledge the likelihood that there will be an increase in the prison population.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By the same argument, could not we replace the fully-suspended sentence by giving the prisoner an absolute discharge and leaving it to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
the next court to give him something more severe if he offended again?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There is a strong body of opinion which takes that view, and I am increasingly coming to share it. The suspended sentence has clearly failed in its objective, but the alternative objective, which the Government are now claiming for the clause—that it would actually reduce the prison population—really depends on the thesis put forward by the hon. and learned Member for Heme] Hempstead (Mr. Lyell).<br><br>
He said that the court, when it considers whether it should send a person for actual imprisonment, might, in those circumstances, decide not to send him for a full term of actual imprisonment but for a short term of actual imprisonment with a suspended sentence attached to it. That would mean that it would be likely to take the view that a shorter period of actual imprisonment was merited and that would cut down the number who went to prison.<br><br>
If the courts took that view, that would be correct. But they could take the alternative hypothesis that, instead of dealing with the prisoner by a sentence of non-custodial treatment or a fine, they could send him for partial imprisonment and a partially-suspended sentence. The court might well take that view in a particular case. So the judgment of the effect of this on the prison population depends on how many times the judiciary decides for the first alternative as against the second.<br><br>
If that is the position, I do not think that we have obtained much comfort from the fact that when a suspended sentence was tried, the same dilemma obtained for the court, and overall the effect of the suspended sentence was to increase the prison population, not to decrease it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed with care and admiration the hon. Gentleman's extremely careful speech, but does he not accept that the point that he is now making depends upon the proposition that the courts never learn from past mistakes? Is it not common ground, a view held widely by the judiciary, that the suspended sentence was misapplied in many cases, not least because for its first six years it was mandatory within certain age bands? Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that that is widely recognised to have been mistakenly applied and is his point not based upon the proposition that nobody ever learns when on the Bench?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Few of them do. The Minister tempts me into an area of argument in which I reluctantly join.<br><br>
The real issue is the way in which the judiciary approaches the whole problem of sentencing. The Minister asks whether the judiciary has not learned from its mistakes in relation to suspended sentence. The judiciary does not consider that to have a great many more in prison is a mistake. It is part of the difficulty that we face. We have had the argument many times in Committee. It is part of the education process of the judiciary that it does not believe that more people in prison is a mistake.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. If the upshot of the suspended sentence is that it actually leads to more people in prison, the judiciary says that that is the fault of the accused because he did not take advantage of the suspended sentence when it was passed upon him. The judiciary says that if he receives a suspended sentence and keeps out of trouble, he will not add to the prison population. If he comes back again, the court feels bound to send him to prison. That is not the court's fault but the offenders fault. Therefore, the judiciary <i>do</i> not regard it as a mistake. The man actually goes to prison in the end.<br><br>
Whether or not one considers it a mistake depends upon one's penal philosophy. We know what the penal philosophy of most Conservative Members is because they have been selected for that purpose. If we had had a broad band of the Conservative Back Bench, a few Members would have supported the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) representing the Penal Affairs Group. His amendments are signed by Conservative Members but none of them was appointed to the Committee. So we know the attitude of most of those behind the Minister. They take the same view as the judiciary.<br><br>
If the Minister now says that I am doing the judiciary a disservice, I am bound to ask why on earth he has not come forward with a proposal, which we all knew that the Home Secretary espoused, of having the one-third mandatory parole. In that situation, there would certainly have been a very substantial immediate reduction in the prison population. The reason why it was not brought forward was because of the attitude of the judiciary. It was the attitude of the higher judiciary but I dare say that, if a vote had been taken of the Crown court judges, it would probably have been even worse.<br><br>
Five or six people in England decided that a proposal which is widely canvassed, supported by a considerable section of the House, certainly supported by the Home Office, and the policy of the Home Secretary, should not be carried. Why did the Home Secretary not carry it? Because he thought that, if he did, the judiciary would increase the tariff in order to allow for the reduction of one-third in the sentence that was to be allowed under mandatory parole.<br><br>
That was not the case in Northern Ireland where the system was tried. The judiciary in Northern Ireland did not do that. Perhaps the judiciary in Northern Ireland comprises a more enlightened breed of men than the judiciary in England. It would not have to be very enlightened to be that. The fact is that the judiciary still do not accept that the requirement for shorter sentencing is desirable on good penal grounds, never mind the cost to the Exchequer of sending people to prison. It is not true that we are advancing shorter sentencing simply because the Government cannot afford to pay for more prisons, yet every member of the Bar and every person on the Bench believes that that is the only reason it is being advocated. For that reason,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
they are reluctant to take the line the Home Secretary was pushing.<br><br>
If that is true of mandatory parole, why does the Minister think that on partly-suspended sentences they will take one alternative which would lead to a lesser prison population or the other alternative which will lead to a higher prison population? My instinct is that they will take the second and not the first. In those circumstances, it will be the worst of all worlds. The Minister is simply laying in store a problem for the next administration, about changing this policy.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I am absolutely certain that whoever comes into Government after the next election will have to change this policy and will have to introduce some method of reducing the prison population, which takes away the discretion of the judiciary in this respect. They might as well face up to it now as then, because in the meantime, we shall go well over the 45,000 who will burst the prison population and make it impossible for the prison regime to be run as it is at the moment. They may still be able to find places to send the extra thousands who will go to prison, but if they do it will not be under a system like the present one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Pitt<span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) echoed the sentiments of us all when he said that he wants to see a reduction in the prison population. Sadly, I think his method of reducing the prison population will only expand it further.<br><br>
At the moment we have a prison population of approximately 42,500 and, as we have said many times in this debate, we have high recidivism rates for borstal and detention centres. We have grossly over-populated prisons, and if a dangerous situation is to be averted, the number of people cooped up in these appalling conditions in buildings which, were animals to be housed in them, would have been demolished years ago, must be reduced at the very least by 5,000, to reach the certified normal accommodation of 38,500. As recently as December 1981 the prison governors described the situation as:
<br><blockquote><p>"growing squalor as many prisons become festering slums. Human degradation on this totally unacceptable scale stokes up the fires of inmate discontent and may ultimately bring about a break-down of the penal system."</p></blockquote>
Those are strong words for people who are not normally renowned for their outspokeness. They want to see a reduction in the prison population to 32,000 if the standards laid down in the European standard minimum rules are to be met. This would mean a reduction of some 10,000 people in one fell swoop.<br><br>
Yet the Government have decided to implement the partly-suspended sentence against the advice of almost everyone with any knowledge of the penal and criminal justice system in this country. Estimates vary as to the precise effect that this mechanism will have on the prison population. The most optimistic estimate—and one which the Government will no doubt be glad to accept—is a reduction of 4,000, barely enough to ensure that the overcrowding
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
ceases on today's figures. If the population reaches 45,000 again, as it did last year, this will be totally inadequate. The most pessimistic estimate is that the population could increase by 8,000 people, a horrifying thought for even the most conservative of people.<br><br>
The facts on the cost of keeping people in prison are too well known to rehearse again, although they do offer an unassailable economic argument in favour of reducing the number of people in custody. There are other arguments against the partly-suspended sentence that do bear repeating. The Home Office's own publication ' Review of Parole in England and Wales'—a document the fate of which many of us regret—stated that the section now under consideration:
<br><blockquote><p>"has not been activated because of fears that the new sentence would be used to give a taste of imprisonment in cases where at present the courts would impose a fully suspended sentence or a non-custodial sentence … there can be no certainty that implementing Section 47 would achieve any reduction in numbers in custody and would not confer any advantage in the treatment of individual offenders ".</p></blockquote>
Reading that, one is a trifle puzzled as to why section 47 has now been implemented. I do not wish to delay this Committee any longer. I shall finish because I think those few paragraphs have made the argument for not retaining this clause as part of the Bill. I should, however, like to quote the Home Secretary himself because he has stated publicly that—
<br><blockquote><p>"there could be a fall in the use of imprisonment without "—</p></blockquote>
and "without "is the key word in this—
<br><blockquote><p>"any significant rise in the threat to individual safety ".</p></blockquote>
The Government appear to be putting political expediency before the good of the system. I cannot support that and I certainly cannot support, on that basis alone, given all the statistics and arguments put before us by Opposition Members, the inclusion of this clause within the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been the most vigorous and interesting of the debates we have had so far and we have had many that have been of a very high quality. I have become increasingly diffident as I have listened to the attributions that have been made of this clause to me.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) described it as having been introduced by an accident. The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) described its genesis as a sordid history. I do not know that I can claim to have been the only begetter of this clause. I do not know whether I have even been described as a sordid accident before. I suppose this has been the outcome of all that.<br><br>
Very sound reasons can be adduced in support of this clause. I take particular heart from the scrupulously fair speech made in our debate by the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk). I acknowledge with gratitude that he does not see a difference in objective between the Government as a whole and the Opposition. All share the same objective of wanting to see fewer people in prison within
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
a framework of a properly constructed criminal justice system.<br><br>
However, a properly constructed and applied criminal justice system has to take account of the need to protect the public, but, of course, within that overall framework we all want to see fewer people in our prisons, especially at a time when they suffer gross overcrowding, particularly in the local prisons. That is an extremely helpful basis upon which to explore the divisions that this debate has revealed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) asked about the increase in the prison population. Perhaps it would be helpful at the outset to describe what has happened. The prison poulation has risen from just under 41,000 at the turn of the year to just under 44,000 now—43,764 at 26 February.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not enough to say "disgraceful ". We can all say, "disgraceful ", but it does not assist us to improve matters. We start from the fact that it is very unwelcome. It is not unexpected for the reason that customarily there is a substantial dip in the weeks before Christmas and customarily there is a substantial increase in the early weeks and months of the following year. We are not suddenly facing a new situation. The rise in the prison population, for reasons that are not always clear, is affected by seasonal fluctuations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is wrong. It is a disgrace, and he knows it is a disgrace. As he had already said, it is not a new situation. What has happened over increasing numbers has been happening for the past two years. He has been well enough warned about it, and the consequence of those numbers is, as the prison officers and prison and borstal governors have said, a disgraceful, intolerable situation for both officers and prisoners. The Government should have taken quicker and more effective action to reduce the population, and to prevent it becoming appallingly overcrowded in some of the local prisons. That is why there is this argument today about partly-suspended sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. I shall deal with one or two—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister intervened in my speech about six times.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with one point at a time. I shall give way later. Nobody can conceivably suppose that it is other than deeply disturbing and unwelcome that we should have the level of overcrowding in our prisons that we have. It does not assist us in the issues which are thrown up by this debate, and by the clause, to say that it is disgraceful, or any other epithet. We have to see whether we are able, consistently with protecting the public, and consistently with out present stock of prison accommodation, to do anything to reduce that overcrowding. I shall not embark upon an examination of how many more prison spaces we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
might have had had the last Government not made the cuts they did year after year in their prison building. I do not think that will assist us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman. He said that this was to some extent due to the seasonal rise that we always have. Would he not agree that this rise of 3,000 since the end of December cannot possible be compared with the seasonal rise in previous years? Is he explaining it on that basis, or can he not offer any other explanation? This seems far greater than in the previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rise we have had since Christmas reflects what we have seen in other years. I do not doubt that it also reflects the fact that an enlarged police force is catching more criminals. There is an element of that. We have not, as yet, because it is too soon, a precise statistical analysis of the components of this increase, but I think it helpful to say that, unwelcome though it is, it reflects what we are accustomed to at this time of the year.<br><br>
What must not be overlooked is that a substantial fall took place from the high point of 45,500 last summer. There was a fall of more than 4,000 in the prison population during the second half of 1981. The total rise in the first two months of 1982 seems to have been similar to that in the first two months of 1980.<br><br>
It is too soon to be able to analyse the changes in the prison population in these first two months, but the evidence for 1981 and for 1980 is not discouraging when one makes this comparison. The criminal statistics for 1980 included an analysis of sentencing trends following the Court of Appeal judgments in Upton and Bibi. From that it was clear that sentence lengths imposed in the second half of 1980 were shorter than those imposed a year earlier. Thus the average length of sentence given after trial by the Crown Court in the second half of 1980 was about two months shorter than in the same period a years earlier, while the sentences imposed in the magistrates' courts likewise showed a reduction.<br><br>
This is very important. I am told endlessly—I diverge here—that nobody who knows anything about the prison system, the penal system and the criminal justice system has anything in favour to say of the clause. I do not know why it should be supposed that those people who actually impose the sentences should have opinions of negligible value of the effect of the clause on their future sentences. The secretary of the Magistrates' Association, when we announced that we were implementing section 47 of the Criminal Law Act 1977—the partially-suspended sentence clause—was reported in <i>The Guardian</i> on 27 February, as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Association did not believe the move would increase the prison population.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"' Part suspended sentences should only be used when a fully served sentence would otherwise have been imposed,'"</p></blockquote>
I believe that I am entitled to take a little comfort from that, when I am invited to believe that every-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
body will use die clause and die partially-suspended sentence to increase the number of people in prison.<br><br>
I also acknowledge that, of course, my right hon. Friend consulted the judiciary. It would have been a very remarkable act of neglect if he had not. I& it to be supposed that it is better to go against the grain of judicial opinion when one consults and one learns that there is a risk that in certain cases the view will be taken that so great will be the gap between die sentence nominally imposed and the sentence actually served, that die courts will feel it their duty to the community which they serve to increase the length of the nominal sentence so as to increase the length of time that will be served in prison, and bring it nearer to that which they believe the justice of the case requires?</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say how the Home Secretary consulted the judiciary—by what means, how many he spoke to, under what circumstances? Was there a representative organisation, how were the votes taken, was it a representative sample? How effective, thoroughgoing, and representative was the sample. Or was it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) points out, five men in a room, as portrayed on "Panorama "?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows better than that. He knows perfectly well that there are well-established ways in which die Home Secretary consults the judiciary at all levels, whether it be the magistrates, or die higher judiciary. The hon. Gen-deman knows that sentencing seminars are held. He knows perfectly well that diere are means by which judicial opinion can be accurately consulted.<br><br>
Had no consultation with the judiciary taken place, for Heaven's sake, in the review of parole in England and Wales 1981, which we are told is such an important document for the purposes of the case put forward by Labour Members, it was said in the foreword written by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has as yet come to no conclusion on that question,"—</p></blockquote>
that is to say, the question of early release—
<br><blockquote><p>"or on whether any other changes are desirable, but I believe that it will be most helpful to Parliament and the public to have this document available as a basis for informed discussion of these matters."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the Home Secretary put forward proposals for consultation without believing that there was merit in those proposals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman knows well why merit was seen in these proposals at the outset. There is still merit in the first proposals. One consequence of them was that if the most optimistic forecast were made, and if use was made of early release in every case to which it would have been appropriate, up to 7,000 places in the prison system could have been saved. If one looks at that aspect of it alone, there was merit in it. Naturally, the Home Secretary would not put forward a proposal if there was no gain to be made in any sector
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
of the spectrum, but one must not look at one sector only and ignore the others.<br><br>
Having put this forward and stated in terms that the Government have as yet come to no conclusion but that he believed that it would be helpful to have this document available as a basis for informed discussion, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is now—as I understand it—invited to disregard that part of the informed opinion that is unfavourable to those advancing the case for early release—[<i>Interruption</i>]. Some hon. Members are saying "Yes "and others "No ". That seems to be a good reason for giving way to the hon. Member for York who will probably justify both.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that if one sends out a consultative document, one will receive the replies "Yes"and "No". Why did not the Home Secretary take the balance of opinion, because that was heavily in favour? It was only the judiciary who were against.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only the judiciary! It is revealing, is it not, that the hon. Gentleman says that it is only the judiciary, it is only those who will actually pass the sentences who say that sentences may be longer. We cannot disregard the opinions of those who will pass the sentence when we ask ourselves what will be the effect on future sentences and on the future prison population if we adopt option A or option B. It is not merely a question of striking a balance and saying that there are five organisations on this side and only four on that. One must make a qualitative assessment as well.<br><br>
Naturally, when one puts forward proposals of this sort, one wants to test the water. If one is led to believe that there is a risk not only by the judiciary but by the probation officers that the degree of supervision that could be given under the early release scheme was not realistic, is that perhaps not a respectable reason for thinking again? For some reason, probation officers appear to be regarded as rather more respectable than the judiciary and I take it that that point is seen to have some weight. But the probation officers were very disturbed at the prospect of having to give supervision in the short period that might be available to them if release after one-third was given.<br><br>
I make no bones about it. We consulted widely and, among those consulted we included the judiciary. It is absolutely right that we should have had an open mind. We came to realise that, if we were to proceed with what had tentatively been put forward as a scheme extending the principle of parole but without the element of selection, we might very well end up with longer sentences being passed which would not have been our intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point about the consultations that took place on this document that the Minister consulted a whole range of organisations and bodies and that the judiciary was the only organisation that came out against the proposals in this document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there were other organisations, could the Minister tell us who they were. Could the Minister also tell us in more detail what the judiciary said. If the views of the judiciary are so important, could the Minister spell it out because the impression of many of us is that the judiciary dictated to the Home Office and the Home Office gave way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When one consults, if one is not taking part in a misleading charade, one ought to pay attention to what one is told and then to make a judgment as to where the balance of advantage in the public interest lies.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) does not listen to what I say. The hon. Gentleman asks what other body other than the judiciary was opposed to early release. I have told him one, the probation officers—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall continue. If the judiciary and the probation officer express misgivings, one has to be very arrogant to say "I was right all along and I shall go ahead notwithstanding."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Dean, I am going on for the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is such a nice fellow, as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. It is worth going back into the history of this. This has been Conservative policy for a number of years. It has been supported not only by my hon. Friends, but by the right hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John). It has also been a policy for which the hon. Member for Ormskirk himself found something to be said. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that hon. Members feel strongly about this, but there are too many interruptions from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. Dean. I shall give way in a moment to the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), but it is important to try to get on. The hon. Member for Ormskirk congratulated the then Government when he spoke on Report. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I, too, congratulate the Government on new clause 4"— </p></blockquote>
which became section 47—
<br><blockquote><p>"It is clear that the Minister has acknowledged what was said on all sides of the Committee and by many outside the House—not least by the Howard League for Penal Reform, NACRO and the recent interim report of the Advisory Council on the Penal System—to the effect that the length of sentence has little relationship to deterrent effect."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The new clause does not just have the motive of reducing the level of the prison population—although that is important—but is intended to give the courts greater flexibility and discretion in their sentencing processes which, in company with the hon. and learned Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew), I hope they will use imaginatively. The courts should use the powers available
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
in the new clause to obtain a reduction in the prison population and a far more sensible attitude to sentencing."<i>—[Official Report,</i> 13 July 1977; Vol. 935, c. 475-6.]</p></blockquote>
That was the hon. Member for Ormskirk. His right hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd, the then Minister of State, said that it had been argued that this would increase the numbers in prison, and the right hon. Gentleman rejected that argument, as I reminded the Committee in an intervention earlier. The then Minister of State said that it had been suggested that this would lead to an increase in numbers, and said that he believed that the opposite would be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could remind the Minister that he said in an earlier intervention that he would share with the Committee the reasons that were available to his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) as to why the introduction of this scheme would increase the prison population.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. Gentleman reminded us of what was said by the Minister of State in the Conservative Government in December 1979. He made it clear that he supported the principle of the clause and that he would like to see it implemented. He said that the Government would need to consider the recommendations of the May report before deciding to implement. That was in 1979, before Upton and Bibi and before the lead given by the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal. That was before the consequential reduction in prison sentences that the hon. Gentleman himself in this Committee has acknowledged has already begun to take place. That was before the follow-up judgments, of which the most recent was only two or three weeks ago in the Court of Appeal pointing out that, whereas prison sentences, and substantial prison sentences for violent offenders must always be available, nevertheless, where a prison sentence had to be made for a non-violent case the court should always ask what was the least that was necessary in the interests of public safety and impose the least that was necessary.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
That was before all these welcome developments had taken place. That was before the consultations that took place this summer following the publication of the review of parole document, which made it abundantly clear that the judiciary is well aware that the wholly suspended sentence introduced 12 or more years ago, had especially in its early years, been misapplied. It was applied not to cases where otherwise the court would have awarded a sentence of immediate imprisonment. Instead a suspended sentence of imprisonment was used as a threat.<br><br>
In numerous cases a further offence was committed and the suspended sentence had to be activiated. People were going into prison on the activation of their suspended sentences, who would never have been given an immediate sentence of imprisonment had suspended sentences not been available. That is the nature of what went wrong. Of course, one does not object to the activation of a suspended sentence.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
If one gives a suspended sentence and says that it will be activated on re-offending, of course one must go on and do it. The mistake made in many cases was to use a suspended sentence not as an alternative to an immediate sentence of imprisonment, but where an immediate sentence of imprisonment would not have been given. That is well understood, and I have read today from the Magistrates' Association spokesman, that partly-suspended sentences should be used only when a fully-served sentence would otherwise have been imposed.<br><br>
In terms, that is an expression of the fact that the lesson has been learned. This is also common to the higher judiciary. What has changed since my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby expressed those fears in 1979, is that there is a far wider appreciation of the way in which a sentence that is wholly-suspended or partly-suspended should, and could, properly be used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now admitting that when he brought forward this proposal in 1977 it was premature and wrong, and if he was wrong then, can we place any more reliance on his judgment now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have always been sound penological reasons. The hon. and learned Gentleman thinks he has scored a great point—it must be a novel experience. I remind him of the penological advantages that the Advisory Council saw then. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This enables the court to pronounce a sentence commensurate with the nature and gravity of the offence, but which does not need to be fully executed."</p></blockquote>
Secondly:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a double deterrent effect consisting of an initial period of custody with the balance of the sentence providing postponed deterrence during the suspension period."</p></blockquote>
Thirdly:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any deterrent effect in the suspended part of the sentence may be enhanced by the immediately preceding period of custody, which may well be more effective if that period is sufficiently short at least for those who have not been previously sentenced to imprisonment to avoid acclimatisation to prison conditions."</p></blockquote>
Fourthly:
<br><blockquote><p>"Partial suspension provides an opportunity for the court to impose a shorter custody than it otherwise might knowing that on release from prison a specific contingent liability to imprisonment will remain."</p></blockquote>
Lastly, and I am speaking of the Advisory Council's findings:
<br><blockquote><p>"It fills a gap between full suspension which in some cases may represent excessive leniency or mitigation and full immediate imprisonment."</p></blockquote>
I find myself in good company at or about that time, when advancing partially-suspended sentences for their penological advantages. It is for their penological advantages that one can principally claim virtue, but we may also look for an ancillary virtue and effect in the reduction that will take place if they are properly applied in the prison population. That is the way in which I put it; first, very sound penological advantages and, secondly, if they are properly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
applied, a valuable reduction in the prison population. So the question is "May we reasonably suppose that they will be properly applied?"That is what this debate ought to focus upon.<br><br>
For the reasons that I have given of the changes that have taken place, and the developments that have occurred since 1979, we may reasonably suppose that they will be properly applied. If that is said to be a gamble, I acknowledge that it is a gamble. I have already done so. It is a gamble that is responsible and is based upon sensible consultation with those who will pass these sentences. It will more than justify the Committee as saying that the clause should stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson<span class='memberconstituency'> (Accrington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, who is normally almost excessively charming, has been unusually testy this morning. He has been testy from the very beginning. I suspect the reason is his deep personal involvement with this proposal. The hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) graphically described the background to this proposal and the Minister's deep and personal commitment at a time, if I may add in his own words, when it was an even greater "gamble "than it is now, though he was personally committed to it then.<br><br>
In his reply, towards the end of his speech he said, that things have changed and that is why this proposal will now have the effect, or may have the effect, of reducing the prison population, and that it will not be used to send people to prison who might normally not have had a custodial sentence.<br><br>
The Minister of State has changed, and the judges and judiciary have rejected the early release proposals contained in the review of parole carried out by the Home Office. That is what has changed. The Minister rightly put great stress on the views of the judiciary. I do not object to that. As far as he is concerned, the views of the judiciary overrode the views of all other bodies who were in favour of the early release scheme. If that is the case, we on this Committee are entitled to ask him to spell out in very simple language the objections that the judiciary presumably so forcibly put forward.<br><br>
What were its objections? The Minister has not told us. He has said that the probation officers were not enamoured of the early release scheme. I think he has unconsciously misled the Committee because the probation officers were not opposed to the principle of the scheme, but to the compulsory supervision, part of it because it was somewhat burdensome. I do not think the Minister should give the impression—I am not saying that he deliberately set out to do so—that the probation officers were opposed to the principle of the scheme, as presumably the judiciary was. We have not received a satisfactory reply from the Minister and in all the circumstances I would certainly urge my hon. Friends to vote against this clause.</span></p>

EARLY RELEASE OF PRISONERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 28, line 26, after "life ", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"unless that sentence was imposed for a crime involving violence ".</p></blockquote>
I think all hon. Members would agree that we want to see a reduction in the number of people in prison. I do not think anybody would deny that, but there is an area in connection with this clause that I, and I believe the general public, find extremely disturbing. In my remarks this morning I am referring only to crimes of violence. I want to make that absolutely clear at this stage.<br><br>
I believe that people are very worried and concerned about crimes of violence. About 8,000 crimes a day are being committed in our streets. There are aproaching 45,000 people in prison.<br><br>
I should like to draw attention to crimes of violence, and to the increase in such crimes over the last decade. In the statistics that are put out by the Home Office dealing with England and Wales, we can see the figures relating to violence against the person. They are given in percentages of thousands. In 1970, the figure was 41·1 per cent. In 1980, it rose to 97·2 per cent., and if the projection for the first three-quarters of last year is continued into the last quarter of 1981, we reach a figure of 100 per cent. Therefore, in the last decade there has been a doubling in crimes of violence on our streets and in our cities. I find that very disturbing.<br><br>
If we examine public opinion polls, we find that the things that worry people most of all with regard to law and order are the muggings and the crimes of violence that occur in their homes, on the streets in the subways and wherever else such crimes occur. I strongly believe that if the Committee— and the Government—allow those people who have committed crimes of violence to be released early, there will be immense problems ahead.<br><br>
I would not deny—and I shall support this later —the proposal that prostitutes and vagrants should not go to prison. I firmly believe that it is ridiculous
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
in this day and age that we should put people in prison for that sort of activity when we have such a problem of numbers in our prisons, and when we are considering the early release of those who have committed crimes of violence. I shall support later the moves that I suggested with regard to prostitutes and vagrants.<br><br>
I should like some clarification from the Minister. In releasing a prisoner six months early, does that take into account good conduct, parole and such things, or does it not take those into account? This is an important factor when we are discussing this issue. Further, it is not the first time that the question of early release has been considered. Early release was mooted in the Criminal Justice Act 1977, and has been talked about on numerous occasions. I am a little disturbed, however, that we are not again leaving the situation to the judges, because early release takes a certain amount of power away from the judicial system, and gives it to the Executive.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
I quote a remark made by Judge James Pickles when addressing the Inner Manchester branch of the Magistrates' Association recently. He said that
<br><blockquote><p>"the judiciary was not a minor branch of the executive but an indendent arm of government."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely true. I am a little nervous that we are now beginning to embark down an avenue that will be extremely dangerous. We have always in this country in the past had, and prided ourselves, in our judiciary and Parliament, once the laws had been made, being entirely independent. It has been the model and, indeed, the envy of the world. It would be disastrous if we started to embark on any avenue that would destroy that. Destroy that, and we destroy the heart and soul of democracy. I believe that to be very important.<br><br>
I am very concerned about this. It is the great concern of my constituents, and of everybody I talk to. I believe that the Government will have a lot of good will from the public if, in respect of prostitutes and vagrancy, they try to reduce prison numben.<br><br>
There is a great danger that that will become antagonism if we release much earlier those who committed crimes of violence. Let me quote from the Conservative Party manifesto at the last general election, which states it very clearly.
<br><blockquote><p>"For violent criminals and thugs really tough sentences are essential. But in other cases long prison terms are not always the best deterrent. So we want to see a wider variety of sentences available to the courts."</p></blockquote>
I fully agree with that, but in the amendment that I have tabled we are talking of violent criminals and thugs, and I suggest that the amendment is totally in the spirit and in keeping with the party manifesto at the last general election.<br><br>
I am also very concerned that, although guarantees were given on Second Reading by the Minister, that people who had committed crimes of violence would not be released early while the Government were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
in power, that does not guarantee on a change of Government, or perhaps on a change of Home Secretary, that people would not be released early. I am concerned that this opens the door to the future in many directions.<br><br>
The public is one great concern, and another is the police. Police numbers have increased very much over the past two or three years, as a direct result of increased pay and the Home Secretary's encouragement to join the force. I do not detect, however, even as a result of that, that morale has risen much higher. Indeed, if one speaks to senior police officers who have been in the force for some time, they will say that many of their age group have left the force and many are still leaving it.<br><br>
I firmly believe that if we are to start releasing criminals who commit violent crimes, this will have a great and serious effect on morale in the force, for the police must arrest and tackle people who are often extremely vicious. They would be exposed to injury and danger, and there would be a great danger that more senior police officers would leave the force. That would create further problems. As anyone who has knowledge or background of policing or of the police force knows, the younger constable only learns by the experience of working with an older constable on the beat. If that experience is not passed on, there is a great danger that the young inexperienced constable will have problems dealing with situations where he has not had the benefit of working with an older person. That would lead to further problems between the police and the public and probably to complaints about the attitude of the police. We must consider the problems with morale.<br><br>
I ask my hon. and learned Friend the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration. It is no answer to say that because our prisons are full we should release early those who have committed crimes of extreme violence. We have done little about our prisons since the Victorian era. Little has been done during the past 15 years. I remind the Committee that during most of that period the present Opposition were in Government. It is a sad reflection on society and on ourselves that we have not modernised and improved our prisons. We expect action in the National Health Service and many other directions, but people become worried about mental institutions or prisons only when there is a crisis. We, as a modern society, must tackle these problems. The general public must realise that if they want law and order they will have to pay for that privilege. That means that more prisons must be built and that the existing prisons must be modernised.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration. By releasing early those who have committed crimes of violence, we are risking the whole of our judicial system and our prison system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I do not disagree with most of what the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) has said. The sentiments behind the amendment are sensible. No one in his right senses
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
—and most Committee Members are in possession of their senses most, if not all, of the time—would want violent criminals unleashed on the public as a result of the early release proposals in the Bill. Indeed, if that happened the whole purpose behind the clause would be destroyed and there would be considerable public hostility. Clearly, no Home Secretary given these powers would be acting sensibly if he released on the public prisoners who had been sent to prison for committing violent crimes. There is no doubt that crimes of violence are the crimes that most offend the public and have the worst and most long-standing effect on the victims.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will know, however, that there is a great variation in what is or is not a violent crime. I do not wish to underestimate any crime of violence. I am being careful because I might get one of those treasured interventions from the Minister. But some crimes of violence consist of little more than minor assaults, although they may be devastating on the person assaulted.<br><br>
If the amendment is carried, those who commit serious frauds involving thousands and thousands of pounds—with devastating effect upon those who have been defrauded—could be the subject of early release, whereas someone who had committed a relatively minor assault might not be released. That is somewhat discriminatory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which does the hon. Gentleman think more serious—a person who has defrauded somebody or one who has committed violence upon somebody else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to give an opinion. The person who has been defrauded, lost vast amounts of money and possibly suffered bankruptcy would consider that a serious offence had been committed against him. The victim of an assault would also consider that to be a serious offence. I am not denying that. It is subjective. All I am saying is that the amendment, well-intentioned though it may be, could result in an anomalous position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it possible that the problem with the amendment—with which broadly I sympathise—is that it is not only the use of violence in the carrying out of crime that is thoroughly objectionable but the threat of violence. If we examine the crimes against the person as distinct from crimes against property, either the use or the threat of violence is involved. Perhaps the Committee should focus attention on crimes against the person. There is no doubt that the average man on the Clapham omnibus, who was referred to earlier, regards crimes against the person as inherently more serious than crimes against property, whatever the hon. and learned Gentleman might say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. I think that the average man does think that. Fewer people are likely to be defrauded than to be assaulted. I am in no way underestimating the effect of violent crime and the public's detestation of it. Like most members of the Committee, I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say about it. For the reasons I have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
given, I hope in a reasonable and open-minded way, it appears to me that the hon. Gentleman's amendment, well-intentioned as it is, could create anomalies and certain unfairness if the whole idea of early release is to be effective and to have public support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the views of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson). It is one of the saddest commentaries on our society that in many of our towns people are afraid to walk the streets at night. They did not have that fear 20 or 30 years ago. Everybody recognises that. The real issue is what can be done about a very serious social problem. No Opposition Member belittles the gravity of the problem. Many of us represent constituencies with that problem.<br><br>
The solution to the problem probably lies in other directions, such as catching the criminals and in the values of our society that are influenced by television and other issues that go beyond the purposes of the clause and the amendment.<br><br>
I am concerned that the expression "a crime of violence "is difficult to apply objectively. We all interpret it in different ways. Perhaps I might give an example by answering the question that the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) asked a few minutes ago. Some crimes, which are not crimes of violence against the person, are just as serious.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
For example, although a dealer in heroin is not directly committing a crime of violence against an individual, because of his criminal activities he causes violence to other individuals. That crime is as serious as those that are subject of the amendment. Therefore, the actual definition may not achieve the objective behind the amendment. I hope that the Minister can give the Committee an assurance that he already has powers under clause 26 (2) to define the classes of person who might be subject to early release, and that he will use those powers, if necessary, to meet the spirit rather than the letter of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great sympathy to my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall). Anyone who places any special significance upon the character of an offence of violence is absolutely right to say that our constituents and the great mass of the people of this country are disturbed by the incidence of violent crimes. They worry more about that than about any other crime, although I acknowledge that burglary, which takes so important a slice of the criminal statistics each year, is not far behind in the table of public anxiety. Many would characterise burglary as a violent offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to become enmeshed in the definitive terms, but I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will agree that there is a clear distinction. Burglary is robbery. If robbery is accompanied by violence, it is much more serious and objectionable. The burglar who simply enters a house by stealth and takes things—although there may be widespread public objection to his activities —is not in the same category as the burglar who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
enters a house and intimidates or inflicts physical violence on the householder and then helps himself to his belongings. It is precisely that distinction that my hon. and learned Friend is trying to express in separating the categories of those who can avail themselves of that facility and those who, by statute, should be inhibited from doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is also the distinction between someone who does physical violence to a person and someone who burgles in such a violent way that the house is turned upside down. We read about many of the ghastly things that happen. In the table of public anxiety, rejection and abhorrence, burglary is not very far behind violence. I do not disagree that there is a special category in the public mind—and rightly so—represented by crimes of physical violence to the person.<br><br>
It might help the Committee if I take a little longer than I might otherwise have done to deal with this subject. Of course, the courts—acting separately on each case before them—must determine the length of individual sentences. I agree to the hilt with the point about the importance of the independence of the judiciary and of Parliament. Later I shall explain the power that Parliament will have to govern the exercise of the power, under the provisions of clause 26. My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North did not specifically refer to that. He spoke of the importance of the independence of Parliament as well as the independence of the judiciary. I thought that I must draw attention to and emphasise the power that Parliament is specifically given by the clause to control the exercise of the power provided.<br><br>
I must also emphasise another point. My hon. Friend did not refer to the present provisions of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1980, which was passed by Parliament to meet the emergency caused by the prison officers' industrial action. It is important to note that the parliamentary control that this clause will provide over the exercise of powers intended to supplant those of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1980, will be considerably tightened.<br><br>
It is right that the courts, acting through their independent judiciary, should determine the length of individual sentences. It is conceivable that the consequences of their collective decisions, especially in cases that have been exacerbated by a riot, fire or some other emergency could stretch the capacity of the prison system to the point where it would break unless relief was urgently given. There is little room for manouevre in the present system. Its vulnerability to sudden rises in population or contraction in capacity—for example, by losing prison accommodation through fire or some other physical emergency—makes it essential to have available a mechanism by which Parliament can authorise the Home Secretary to intervene if a serious imbalance should arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many inmates in any given prison will be eligible for early release under this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
clause, given that that must be within the last six months of their sentence in any event?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is not an easy question to answer.As my hon. Friend has said, the clause permits the release of any class of person specified within the order only up to six months before his earliest date of release. It may be possible to acquire this information, I shall do my best to do so. I cannot say today how many people in prison are within six months of their earliest date of release. I am told that the maximum number appears to be about 13,000. Parliament has already recognised the need for some form of emergency release, which it expressed in the 1980 Act. I acknowledge that the emergency represented by the prison officers' dispute, though not completely resolved, has lifted. As I said when we debated the proposal to renew the 1980 Act powers, another severe emergency is foreseeable because of the crammed state of certain prisons. We rightly came under considerable attack in the House when we sought to renew the 1980 Act powers for reasons other than those for which they had been granted. The hon. Member for Orms-kirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) said that what was needed was permanent legislation in proper form so that powers that represent executive release, although they have to be authorised by Parliament, should be exercised only in conformity with criteria that Parliament had specifically approved. I agree with that statement.<br><br>
There is no real dispute that the Executive should have power, subject to Parliamentary control, to react to a sudden emergency by releasing particular classes of prisoners. I do not believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North is saying that the principle of the 1980 Act was wrong and remains wrong. He is saying that one should never release violent prisoners under such powers. My right hon. Friend is in complete agreement with that broad principle. My hon. Friend will recall that I said recently in Question Time that violent offenders would not be released pursuant to the emergency powers if they were granted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the objections to including the amendment, given that the powers should never be used in cases of violence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty of specifying a violent offence in statutory language is very great. A large number of offences would be outwith the categories. They extend to all Explosive Substances Act offences, to rape and to offences under the Sexual Offences Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that the category that used to be used of offences against the person would exclude all the offences under the Sexual Offences Act, it would also exclude many offences under the Theft Act and under the Firearms Act. We are not talking about the principle that violent offenders should never be let out. I agree with everybody on that. We are talking about whether we should include this restriction, in some statutory form, in this particular power. If we did that we could not exclude all those who were violent in the offences
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
that they committed. We must concentrate on the importance of excluding those who are violent in the offence which they commit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that one of the dangers is that future Home Secretaries might not agree with his right hon. Friend the present Home Secretary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do. One way of imposing a fetter might be to have regard to the nominal length of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
the sentence concerned. The courts take account of the danger of the offender when assessing the right length of sentence. That is a possibility. I want to reflect upon what has been said. There are substantial difficulties in the wording of the amendment.</span></p>
