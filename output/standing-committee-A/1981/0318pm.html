	<p>"(1) In section 28 of the Legal Aid Act 1974, after subsection (5) there shall be inserted the following subsection—
	<br><q><p>"(5A) Where a person who is in the custody of a magistrates' court and who has been refused bail by that court desires to apply to the Crown Court for bail either of those courts may order that he shall be given legal aid for the purpose of that application"</p></q></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause would provide defendants remanded in custody by a magistrates' court with a legally-aided right of application to the Crown court for bail. Given that the Minister has already intimated in our last but one sitting that he will accept the new clause, I shall not detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish only to say that at the moment a defendant who has been committed in custody to the Crown court for trial or sentence may apply for bail to the Crown court, and the cost of such a bail application is covered by the Crown court legal aid order. However, defendants who are still on remand before a magistrates' court have no right to apply for bail to the Crown court. This new clause would give them such a right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advantages of a Crown court application over the High Court procedure are clear. It is more accessible and therefore speedier and, because of the number of Crown court centres in England and Wales, often in the same building as the magistrates' court, means that a Crown court judge is more likely to be near at hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1979, the Royal Commission on Legal Services in paragraph 14.21 of its final report stated:
	<br><q><p>"It has been proposed by the Law Society that, when a defendant has been remanded in custody by a magistrates' court, his solicitor should be able to make a single oral application to a Crown Court judge in chambers, recovering the fee from criminal legal aid funds "</p></q>
It went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"We recommend that this procedure be adopted as an interim measure, and that the system as a whole should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>668</span>
be reviewed when the effects of the Bail Act 1976 can be fully assessed."</p></q>
I know that Government supporters do not like this reason being put forward, but at a time of unprecedented overcrowding in local prisons and remand centres, it is good to know that the Minister is adopting a positive and constructive attitude. It is true that this proposal will have financial implications, but against the relatively modest cost must be offset the actual cost of keeping defendants in prison and having to produce them in court at regular intervals. That cost must be set against the increase in resources to implement the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is another significant, albeit relatively modest improvement in our criminal justice system. I am grateful to the Minister for having intimated that he is prepared to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not gild the lily. I did not say the other day that I would accept the new clause. I was rather careful in what I said. He will recall that I drew attention to the fact that matters relating to legal aid were the province of my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, and therefore I am not able to go further than I intimated at our previous sitting, which is highly encouraging but not the whole works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Persons in the custody of magistrates' courts can apply for bail to the High Court either via the Official Solicitor or through the Crown Office procedure. The Official Solicitor acts without any means or merits test being applied, but applications are normally dealt with on the papers alone. For one reason or another, there is a low success rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Office procedure involves an oral hearing, and civil legal aid is available for it. But that means that one has to satisfy the local committee that there is a reasonable prospect of success and that one's means are below the statutory maxima.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is subject to those normal merit tests, and it has rarely been granted in the past, although it appears likely that that will change if no alternative avenue of application is provided. The Crown Office procedure has a much higher success rate, although that is probably attributable more to the fact that those using it must either pay privately or satisfy the merits test for civil legal aid than it is to the superiority of the procedure. In other words, it is probably a better case that is taken to the Crown Office than that taken to the Official Solicitor. It has been made clear that both the Lord Chancellor and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary recognise that the present arrangements are not fully satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would provide an avenue of application for bail to the Crown court for persons in the custody of a magistrate's court, and it would enable either the Crown court or the magistrates* court itself to grant legal aid. The Government accept that these arrangements at present are not: satisfactory, and we have already discussed the impact of the divisional court's decision in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>669</span>
Nottingham justices' case. It is true that that decision had added an extra complication, because effectively it has restricted defendants to one fully-argued application for bail unless there is a change of circumstances. That in itself, with the effluxion of time, can constitute a significant new circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a while, however, a defendant is limited to one fully-argued application for bail, although, as I emphasised the other day, the magistrates are under an obligation to consider bail every eight days whether the defendant is there or not. In our view, the solution proposed by the new clause, namely, to provide a legally-aided avenue of application to the Crown court, is the right one. The problem has been a lack of the necessary resources to introduce the new means of applying for bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would clearly be necessary to withdraw legal aid from the Crown Office procedure to help offset the cost, particularly as those applications are, on average, considerably more expensive than applications to the Crown court would be. It would also be necessary to ensure that solicitors had a right of audience for the Crown court application, because that would also help to reduce the cost. A further point that will need to be considered is the form in which legal aid should be provided. The new clause proposes that a separate legal aid order should be granted. We think that it may be preferable to extend assistance by way of representation, which is a more flexible scheme, instead, but we have not yet come to a firm decision about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am therefore able to give an undertaking that we shall give the new clause serious and, as I indicated, sympathetic consideration. We must decide the form in which legal aid should be provided, and we must ensure that the necessary resources are available. The other day, I gave an indication of the measure of resources that would be needed. But if the hon. Gentleman will accept those assurances, I shall undertake to consider the possibility of putting down a Government new clause on Report to give effect to the principle of his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argued forcefully and persuasively in support of the principle in the new clause. I am glad to hear that the Government favour the new clause in general, and we appreciate that there may be certain technical considerations to be looked into, of which the hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned one or two, before the final form of the new clause is put down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always seemed to me that the system of application to a judge in chambers imposes a particularly heavy burden on those who take that route, the only route that has been available up to now, and I imagine it is a heavy burden on the judge too. He has to read through a large amount of paperwork each day of this procedure before he is able to deal with the cases in the court. I think it is generally accepted, whatever the reasons may be, that the Official Solicitor procedure is not very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>670</span>
satisfactory. As the Minister said, the proportion of successful applications under that procedure is relatively low. Whether that is because of the aptitude of counsel, when counsel are instructed privately, or simply because cases dealt with by the Official Solicitor—because of their quantity—are dealt with not so much as individual cases but rather as a group, I do not know. I do not wish to criticise the Official Solicitor in any way. I am only going by the results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the resources are concerned, the cost of civil legal aid in those cases where applications are made to a judge in chambers have to be offset against the costs of legal aid to go to the Crown court. As the Minister said, that avenue, whichever way it is dealt with, is likely to cost less. In addition to that, I assume that the opening of the route to the Crown court through legal aid inevitably would mean that a substantially higher proportion of applications for bail were successful, and the whole purpose of the new clause would be defeated if that were not so. Therefore, the offsetting cost of keeping people in custody unnecessarily would also be taken into account. I appreciate that one Department of State may be gaining at the expense of another Department, but, looking at the taxpayers burdens as a whole, that should not be a consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmly welcome the Minister's positive response to the new clause, and I hope that a clause very much on these lines, except for minor modifications, will be moved by the Government on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should have said that the new clause followed the recommendation of the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group and that I tabled and moved it on behalf of that body.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would require that defendants committed in custody should be brought to trial within a period of 110 days of their committal. As with many of the other new clauses debated today and on previous occasions, this embodies a recommendation of the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group in its report " Too Many Prisoners " published in 1980. It also embodies a recommendation of the Select Committee on Home Affairs in its report of last year entitled " The Prison Service."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may recall that the May committee, in its inquiry into the United Kingdom prison service in 1979, reported on what it referred to as the scandal of the numbers of people held on remand and the length of time that they were held on remand. It observed particularly that remand periods in England and Wales were "excessively long " and had been increasing. It went on to assert that there was a need to do everything possible to bring defendants in custody to trial as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the report of the May committee, which yet again drew attention to the deplorable state of affairs of remand prisoners, certain events have transpired. The Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice have both, I acknowledge, made great efforts to reduce waiting times for trial, and to some extent they have had limited success. They deserve credit for the efforts that they have been making in the last year or so. Yet, at the same time, in spite of their worthy attempts, in spite of their acknowledgment of the seriousness of the problem and, in spite of their attempts to bring down the waiting time, waiting times are much longer today than they were in the mid-1970s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ryman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that right? There is a good deal of evidence available to show that the contrary is the case, that the period of waiting between committal and trial has shortened substantially outside London, and even within the jurisdiction of the Crown courts in London it has been shortened. What is the evidence for the proposition that my hon. Friend is advocating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend had not interrupted when he did, I should have told him. The waiting times are much longer today than they were in the mid-1970s, and that is the evidence that I shall produce. For example, in 1980 the national average waiting time between committal and trial was 10-7 weeks for those in custody, compared with 7-5 weeks in 1975, which is exactly the mid-1970s. The position in London is considerably worse. My hon. Friend asked for the position both inside and outside the metropolitan area. If he cares to look at the evidence, he will find that in London the average
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>672</span>
waiting time in custody was 17 weeks in 1980, compared with 12^ weeks in 1975. I do not know what evidence my hon. Friend has to offer, but the evidence that is available to me supports my contention that average waiting times, both in the metropolitan area and in the rest of the country, have increased today and have increased considerably since the mid-1970s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman is too dismissive of what has been said by his hon. Friend the Member for Blyth (Mr. Ryman), all that his hon. Friend was saying was that waiting times had come down in London and elsewhere. He said " even in London ", and he said that rightly, because the problem in London is much greater. Would not the hon. Member for Ormskirk agree that his hon. Friend is absolutely right? For example, in London in 1979 the average waiting time in days between committal and trial of defendants who were in custody was 149; in 1980, that had come down to 109. The hon. Gentleman will perhaps not know the figures for 1981, but they show a further decline. The hon. Member for Blyth was right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was not listening. I do not intend to bandy words about whether waiting times have increased comparing one base year with another. What my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth was contesting was my assertion that waiting times were longer now than they were in the mid-1970s, and I gave evidence for that. Nothing that the Minister has produced shows that my evidence was wrong. What the Minister said, which is perfectly correct, is that the waiting time in 1980-81 was slightly better than in 1979. I did not dispute that. But I did not use the 1979–80 figure; I used a figure from the mid-1970s compared with the latter part of the 1970s and the 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not important. What is important is the waiting times, which I am sure both my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth and the Minister will accept are too long—or do they not agree with the May committee which said that there were excessively long period of time in which defendants were held in custody? Is the Minister saying that he does not agree with the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor? His right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor said, when he was giving testimony to the Home Office Select Committee, that waiting times were too long. I have already said that both those learned Gentlemen have made strenuous and creditable efforts to reduce waiting time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need to argue about this. We all agree that waiting times have grown and are too long. Not only are the excessively long periods on remand in custody a serious source of injustice. What is worse is the scandal—the May committee's word, not mine—that 44 per cent, of those actually remanded in custody in a year, when we are talking in terms of about 58,000 individuals, will eventually be found not guilty or given a non-custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what the May committee said. That is a scandal. It clearly is a disgrace that such a high
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>673</span>
proportion of individuals should have been incarcerated in prisons and penal establishments, only subsequently to be found not guilty, or to be found by the court to have been guilty but not to have deserved a prison sentence, yet were remanded in custody to await trial, and will wait for a long period in custody. The Select Committee on Home Affairs, speaking of the extended periods which remand prisoners would spend in prison, and the kind of conditions they would have to undergo in prison, said in paragraph 54, that it
	<br><q><p>"would be intolerable enough when inflicted on persons found guilty of an offence, but for the many persons awaiting trial and innocent before the law, these experiences are completely insupportable."</p></q>
A written parliamentary answer on 23 November 1981 revealed that on 30 September 1981 there were 700 prisoners who had been awaiting trial for between three and six months; 300 had been awaiting trial for between six and 12 months; and 100 had been awaiting trial for over 12 months. A further parliamentary answer also estimated that about 10 people awaiting trial in custody on that date had been first remanded in custody more than two years earlier, although some of them had spent time out on bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980, I made a series of detailed inquiries into the specific cases of prisoners who had been awaiting trial in custody for long periods. Those investigations disclosed that in June 1980 one prisoner had spent 600 days in prison on remand awaiting trial, and was then subsequently found not guilty. The following month, a man who had been held in custody for two and a half years was formally found not guilty when the prosecution offered no evidence against him. Those clearly are indefensible cases. It is indefensible, in any event, that somebody should have been held in prison unnecessarily and subsequently found innocent—not guilty, or even guilty but given a non-custodial sentence. It is a disgraceful scandal that they should be held in prison for such long periods of time and then subsequently found not guilty, or have no evidence offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that matter of principle, there is also the fact that very long delays in bringing a person to trial can reduce seriously the chances of justice actually being done in a particular case, not only because the evidence of the prosecution and of the defence is less fresh—their memories are gone—but for a whole variety of reasons to do with the individual and his family, the longer the delay the less likely it is that justice will be done or be seen to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On any one day, on Home Office estimates, there are between 800 and 1,000 prisoners in England and Wales who will have been awaiting trial for periods in excess of 110 days. In Scotland, on the other hand, the law provides that, once a defendant has been fully committed for trial, unless he is released from custody he must be brought to trial within the 110 days. The 110-day period can be extended only at the request of the defence, or if the delay is due to such factors as the illness of the accused, or of a necessary witness, or the judge or a juryman. Both the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>674</span>
the Select Committee on Home Affairs have now recommended in separate reports that a similar rule should be introduced in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the introduction of such a 110-day rule here would not result in a large reduction in the prison population. For one thing, as the Minister has said on previous occasions, in some cases the delay is due to the defence rather than to the prosecution, and the 110-day rule can in any case be waived at the request of the defence. Again, more than 50 per cent, of those remanded in custody eventually receive custodial sentences. I accept that the time spent in custody awaiting (trial will count towards their prison sentence, and therefore that will not reduce the numbers or the time spent in custody. Bringing the trial forward would not affect the total length of time which those people spend in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office nevertheless, in a memorandum to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, estimated that even when those and other factors were taken into account the 110-day rule would reduce the daily average prison population by about 200 —not a negligible or insignificant number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has an opportunity to deal with what always seems to me to be overlooked by those who understandably ask for the adoption of a 110-day rule on the Scots basis in England and Wales. Does he not accept that it is only in a case of delay by the prosecution in bringing the case to trial after it has been committed to the sheriff that the 110-day rule bites? If there were the congestion in the courts in Scotland that there is here—and happily for the Scots there is not anything like the same extent—will the hon. Gentleman not accept that the 110-day rule would be waived, just as the eight-week rule here has frequently to be waived? The delay in bringing the case to trial does not derive from delay or other fault on the part of the prosecution. It arises simply because of the build-up of cases. Was that not brought out of Scotland during a recent strike of court staff, when the number of occasions when the 110-day rule was waived increased enormously? I should like the hon. Gentleman to have the opportunity of dealing with that, because it seems to me to be an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon and learned Gentleman is saying in effect that we must not have any guidelines, any stipulations or any criteria, because they might be waived. I wonder whether he would go to the Secretary of State for Scotland and put the argument to him that there is no point in having the 110-day rule because, when it comes to the crunch, it does not work. Is that the argument that he would like to address to his right hon. Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I apologise to the Committee for perhaps rising a little too often, but it is important to get these questions thoroughly sorted out on the spot. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is not in Scotland the procedure for committal that there is here. Committal to the sheriff in Scotland is a very different matter from the committal procedings—whether of the old-fashioned sort or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>675</span>
by the new, accelerated method—that we have here under the Magistrates' Courts Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I am not saying that there should be no guidelines. The hon. Gentleman knows that the present law in England and Wales requires that cases should be brought to trial within eight weeks after committal, but the 110-day rule operates in totally different circumstances in Scotland, because there is not the committal procedings. It is quite a different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand very well the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman has made. I read it at great length in the memorandum that the Home Office produced in reply to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which was published last December. The Government then argued exactly as the Minister is doing now. It has always been their pet argument that the introduction of the 110-day rule in England and Wales would have little effect. It suggested that the court would grant extensions on the grounds that the backlog of work was too large for the available court capacity to handle, which was not the fault of the prosecutor. That is virtually what the hon. and learned Gentleman has just said. But that is not the way, on the evidence that I have taken the trouble to collect, that the provision is currency interpreted in Scotland where, other than in wholly exceptional periods such as during the period of strike action which disrupted the courts, the rule is strictly enforced and a great deal of pressure is put upon the prosecuting authority to ensure that proceedings are brought expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that that is not the case, I can only submit his arguments to the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Solicitor-General for Scotland and ask him why the authorities in Scotland believe, as they told us in evidence to the Select Committee, that the 110-day rule is important, that it is a crucial feature of their criminal justice system, and results in a shorter period of remand for prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Crown Officers—the Minister asks the questions but he never seems to like to hear the answers—that is what his right hon. and learned colleagues who are Crown Officers say about the way the system operates in Scotland. I shall not say that they are not telling the truth. Perhaps the Minister will say that. We can go only on their evidence, which is conclusive and overwhelming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple point that we are trying to make is that the time that people remain on remand in custody, is excessively long, and, given the experience of a member country of the United Kingdom, that time is unnecessarily long. We have a time limit in Scotland that seems to operate effectively. We want the same kind of time limit to be imposed in England and Wales. We believe it important lo try to ensure the provision of proper safeguards for individual liberty and for remand prisoners, which prevents inordinate and unnecessary delays in their coming to trial. The implementation of a provision along the lines of the 110-day rule would, I believe, be a move in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>676</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is general agreement in the Committe that we wish to reduce as far as possible the period spent in custody before cases are brought to trial. The question we have to ask ourselves is whether a new clause of this nature is likely to assist the position. The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has already acknowledged that circumstances in Scotland are substantially different, yet he seeks to bring the provision direct from Scotland and impose it on the English system. In my view it is not likely to assist, and I suggest that there is a serious danger that by saying that we have introduced the 110-day rule we shall tend to deflect energies away from what is really needed, which is a constant concentration of effort on practical measures actually to bring down average times and the overall times in individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I do not make a party political point when I say that this Government, as soon as they took office, took real measures and made efforts, assisted by the Lord Chief Justice—I move far away from party politics when I bring his name into the matter—to hasten the bringing to trial of persons accused of criminal offences, both in and outside London. The inappropriateness of the 110-day rule is highlighted when we consider the figures, always so expertly given by the hon. Member for Ormskirk, for outside London. I cannot flatter the hon. Member. He has given us so much material, digestible and otherwise, that he is a positive compendium of knowledge on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one has a chance to reflect on the figures for outside London it will be found that the average is far below 110 days. The introduction of a 110-day notion is likely to lead people to rest on their laurels. What we must recognise is that there should be constant pressure to bring down the waiting periods—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Desirable as it is—indeed, important as it is—to reduce the waiting period for those in custody before they are brought to trial, the im position of a provision that is well understood and works quite well in Scotland into the wholly different situation in England is not an appropriate measure.

have a quorum or not, it seems highly inappropriate that one should be addressing one's remarks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What is appropriate in matters of debate is not a point of order unless the speaker infringes the rules of order, and no rule of order has been infringed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Watkins.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again lacking the miracle of 	<i>Hansard,</i> I am unable to complete the syntax of my sentence, and so that the Minister may hear the point that he has already half heard, I shall briefly repeat it. Importing a provision that works well in Scotland but which has no relevance to the overall structure in England is not the best way of securing what we all wish to achieve, which is to reduce the period between the charge, which is the beginning of custody and the refusal of bail, and the date when the person actually comes to trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also making the point that outside London, happily, waiting times, at least on average, are substantially below the 110-day period that would be allowed, I understand that they have been reduced from an average of 82 days to a present average of 65 days. Averages can be terribly misleading but they give some general picture. That is much to be welcomed, and we do not wish people to feel that anything up to 110 days is acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has to be remembered that the exceptions contained in this clause give quite enough latitude to enable the position to be extended if the problem is lack of court time or lack of availability of courts, which it almost inevitably is. I think that we are better advised to rely on that strength of will and determination which, while we all wish to see it go further, has happily been shown by those with the principal responsibilities, the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice, during the past two or three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely sympathise with the spirit behind the clause, seeking as it does the reduction of waiting time between committal and trial for persons in custody. The question that the Committee has to decide on hearing the arguments is whether this is the best machinery for achieving that laudable object. It is perhaps not appreciated by all the Members of the Committee what very real improvements have occurred in the course of the last five years or so. May I remind the Committee briefly of what improvements have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of the summons for directions in criminal cases, where both the prosecution and defence at an early period soon after committal have to indicate to the court what the issues of the case are and the agreements, if possible, that are struck between the prosecution and the defence as to what is in issue and what is not in issue, has contributed enormously to the reduction of the length of time between committal and trial. Delays that previously occurred because witnesses were not available and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>678</span>
things of that nature have thereby been reduced. The atmosphere in the criminal courts has been changed substantially in the past few years. Applications for adjournments brought by either side are treated on the basis that there is a powerful onus to prove that there should be an adjournment, as distinct from the old days when adjournments were granted readily. The judiciary and legal profession are working hard to ensure that cases come on as quickly as possible, whereas in the old days inordinate delays occurred, which operated harshly against defendants in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems that remains, because of lack of court time, is that many of the big cases that take weeks and months are cluttering up the time of the courts. They have to be tried and, for convenience, are very often tried in London although the venue of the original committal was outside London. That takes away from the London court and judge time previously available for dealing with ordinary cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many trivial cases now tried by Crown courts in which defendants are exercising their right to trial by jury take up an enormous amount of time. One must bear in mind that while we want to accelerate business in the courts, sometimes applications are made to postpone trials, which, in effect, operate in favour of the defence. One is all too familiar with the situation in which the defence applies for an adjournment because at the end of the day it gives the defence a strategic advantage by being able to say to the court, to the witness and the jury " This happened such a long time ago that you can't remember anything about it".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the machinery set up in the new clause cure the mischief that still exists? We all want to work to make the waiting period shorter. Frankly, I do not think it does cure the mischief, because the situation envisaged in the clause is inappropriate to that which prevails in the courts in England and Wales. I am not persuaded that the 110-day rule, which works satisfactorily in Scotland under a different legal system, with different concepts of pre-trial procedures, is appropriate for procedures in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not heard a single sensible argument in support of the clause that makes the point how this helps in our system as distinct from that in Scotland. They are different systems. Many people say, understandably, that the system in Scotland is to be preferred in many respects to the system in England. There are many things in the Scottish legal system that are entirely laudable. The fact is that we have to operate within our own system, and I do not see how the imposition of the 110-day rule will improve the mischief that we are trying to cure. I do not see how the 110-day rule will accelerate the period between committal and date of trial. Perhaps it is not appreciated that the 110-day rule, which is appropriate in Scotland, would not have the same benefits in our legal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps I may put it in this way, because I do not want to detain the Committee further. If any arguments are advanced to the Committee now that we have not already heard as to how the 110-day rule can assist in shortening the period between committal and trial.

Friend the Member for Blyth (Mr. Ryman) to say to our hon. Friend the Member for York that it is not his business to teach him Scottish law. I am totally unlettered in these matters, and it might have a bearing on how I vote on the clause. I beg him to give us a little guidance on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely sympathetic to my hon. Friend's dilemma. I will put it in this way. There are substantial differences between the English and Scottish legal systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good my hon. Friend shouting " What? ". There is not time, in the course of this debate, for the Committee to embark on a discussion of all the differences between Scottish and English law. The speeches in this Committee have, in my respectful opinion, Mr. Watkins, been quite long enough on many occasions. I am suggesting to the Committee that I have not yet heard a single argument stating what benefit the 110-day rule would be within the context of our own legal system. When I do hear such an argument I shall listen to it with great interest, and may well change my mind, but at the moment that is my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a great pity if the debate on what is, after all, a very important matter, were to go into what may well be a side issue of the procedural differences between our system and the Scottish system, which I am sure the Minister would be able to explain very clearly to the Committee. I certainly am not able to do so and would not attempt such a task. The problem we are debating is that too many people spend much too long in custody awaiting trial. That is particularly the case, as we know, in London. All the valid points that my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) made in emphasising
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>680</span>
what is wrong about that situation must be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put this debate in context. I remind the Committee—which has read the report " Too Many Prisoners "—that three proposals were made with respect to the question of delay. That which related to the new clause did not propose that there should be a change in the law. It proposed—1 suggest very reasonably—that the difference between our procedure in England and Wales and the Scottish procedure should be considered by the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Office to determine the most appropriate way in which the Scottish 110-day limit system can be adapted to the law of England and Wales. This report was published in June 1980, and I hope that we shall now, in March 1982, hear what conclusion has been given by those two Departments in the intervening time to the recommendation that was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say at once that I would not have approved a recommendation that the Scottish system should be translated directly into our legal system. We had much discussion about it, and we recognised that there were differences in the procedure, although, like my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon), I should like to know, as a result of the examination that I hope has taken place between the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Office, and no doubt the Scottish equivalents, what particular differences they have identified as the material ones that would affect this idea. It is an idea that evidently works in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second recommendation made following a report by the Justices' Clerks Society, which suggested that early radical reforms were necessary to reduce the time spent in custody of prisoners on remand awaiting trial, was that the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Office should establish a working party to conduct an urgent review of all factors affecting that waiting time, including questions of court accommodation, which has been referred to, sitting hours, and so on. A number of matters are listed that we felt ought to be considered to try to improve the position. In our report we noted that 120 Members of Parliament recently signed an early-day motion in support of those recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in an effort to help—and here I know that I part company from my own Front Bench—we put forward the proposal to which the Bill gives effect— after a somewhat heated debate, I believe, at which, unhappily, I was not present. No doubt I would have reduced the temperature had I been present. The proposal for a remand period in excess of seven days where the defendant was legally represented and so consented was agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were therefore not putting forward a lot of fanciful and stupid ideas. We were saying that there is an important problem that needs to be thoroughly investigated. That was in June 1980. Now we have the new clause and so far as I am concerned, it is in the hope that we will hear the results of those investigations that the debate is taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is certainly very much a London one. When I was Attorney-General I recall that at almost every Question Time I was asked questions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>681</span>
about the delay. My successor is being asked regularly about such delay. I have no doubt that he is doing his best to secure the shortening of the time, as I did. One of the reasons for the setting up of the Royal Commission on criminal procedure was to try to discover ways in which the problem could be eased. We have not yet had any tangible result from the report. Perhaps it did not produce any tangible recommendation. I would have liked the recommendation about prosecution to have gone further. The system of regional prosecutors could well make a substantial difference to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Blyth (Mr. Ryman) said that he had not heard any argument in favour of the proposal. Let me try to help my hon. Friend, and in doing so I am not prejudging the eventual outcome of any consideration of the matter. I simply say that there are certain arguments. I accept that in London a great deal of the problem lies with the issue of court time, court premises, judge time, and so on, which matters are in the control of the Lord Chancellor. We know that successive Lord Chancellors have done a great deal. My noble Friend Lord Elwyn-Jones did a great deal to improve the situation in London and the fruits of what he did are, not unnaturally, becoming more obvious over the years. No doubt, what is now being done by the present Lord Chancellor will also bear fruit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that aspect on which the Minister laid great emphasis in his intervention, there is undoubtedly another important aspect. This is true particularly in London and particularly in relation to the long cases to which my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth referred. Unhappily, it is the case that the prosecution system that we have in England in relation to difficult and technical cases, cases where a large number of people may be involved as defendants, has certainly in the past led to proceedings with a large number of defendants and a large number of charges that inevitably cause great complications and the expenditure of a great deal of time. I know that judges, the Lord Chief Justice, and others have done their best to persuade counsel and the Director of Public Prosecutions, when it lies within their power, to reduce that problem by splitting up cases, by avoiding a multiplicity of charges where that is unnecessary. Certainly, I did that as Attorney-General and I have no doubt that my successor has done that. Nonetheless, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth pointed out, it is still done, or at any rate, there are still very long and complex cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way in which a proposal on the lines of the Scottish proposal would help would be that the inevitable time that is taken in preparing these highly complex cases, with a large number of defendants and large number of charges, would be set against a time limit, which would force the prosecution, sometimes unwillingly, to resort to procedures that reduced the time and the complexities of the trial in a way that is not always done at present. I believe that that applies outside London as well. It happens outside London, certainly in my experi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>682</span>
ence, but I quite agree that it happens more in London than outside. To the extent that it applies outside London, this is where I feel that the new prosecution system proposed by the Royal Commission would help considerably, particularly if the regional prosecutors were subject to a degree of central control that ensured that there was a policy of avoiding this kind of problem rather than leaving such matters to the solicitor advising a local chief constable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in the suggestion put forward by my right hon. and learned Friend. It is the first time that this argument has been used before the Committee today. Would my right hon. and learned Friend not agree that one of the undesirable practical consequences of the course that he is advocating—that the prosecuting authority should have a time limit within which to get its tackle in order between committal and trial— would be that the committal proceedings would take place later, because the person advising the prosecution would take great care that his tackle was fully in order before the committal took place, so that the period between committal and trial would not be required to be longer? If my right hon. and learned Friend's suggestion were incorporated into the law there would be further delay between arrest and committal instead of between committal and trial because the prosecution would organise the documentation of the case in greater detail before the committal knowing that there would be insufficient time after committal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That possibility is one of the factors which, no doubt, the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Office, with the advice of the Scottish Office and the Lord Advocate, will have considered in the period since June 1980. No doubt they have weighed it up and the Minister will be able to tell us to what extent it is a real factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more preparation that goes into a case before committal proceedings the better. In some cases it could result in there being no committal proceedings because evidence might be discovered to show that the case was less strong than had been thought. I would not regret time spent before committal proceedings if it tended to lessen the time spent between committal proceedings and the trial. But I agree that it is a factor that must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again let me make it clear that I do not advocate that this system should be employed. However, it is a system that those concerned with the Scottish legal system swear by and say works extremely well in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that cases in London in particular may be more complicated than those in Edinburgh. I am not altogether sure why, but perhaps they are. If so, we shall be told the reasons. I can understand that there may well be differences in procedure, even if I cannot identify them, which make a Scottish system unsuitable for the English courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this point in the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument, could he explain

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>683</span>
why the existing time limit in the system in England and Wales—the eight-week rule provided by rule 19 of the Crown court rules made under power contained in section 7 of the Courts Act 1971 does not provide for that for which he is arguing? As he knows, there is a large proportion of cases in which the eight-week rule is extended, but seldom by reason of a delay attributable to the prosecution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are the sort of points that I hope the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor have weighed up. No doubt we shall hear about them. The 110-day system appears to work well in Scotland. I am not saying that there is no other system that could work well in England and Wales. If I thought that, I should be advocating it rather than putting it forward for discussion. The fact remains that, despite all the rules we have in England and Wales, there are still protracted delays that cause concern. We have not been able to get rid of them. We know some of the reasons for those delays. I accept entirely that those concerned are doing what each in his sphere can do to improve matters. None the less, there are still great delays that should give the Committee cause for considerable concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is on that basis that I ask the Minister to let use know and weigh up all the factors involved. If he produces sound reasons why a system of this kind is not applicable to us, or if he produces sound reasons why the existing system works better than the Scottish system, I shall be interested to hear them and it will satisfy me. But I hope that he will not suggest that bringing forward the proposal in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Orm-skirk has done is in any sense wasting time, because it is one of the most important questions that we must consider in our all too rare reviews of how to avoid offenders having excessive periods in custody. Any time spent in examining that is to the public good and the public advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is becoming like a who-done-it. Hon. Members keep referring to the differences between Scottish law and the law in England and Wales, but seem, to my lay mind, unable to give convincing reasons for the differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) said that it was not relevant to put the two systems alongside each other. My mind is clearer since my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) spoke, but even he did not unlock the door into the room where I could discover the exact differences and the obstacles to our adopting the Scottish system. If the Scottish system is not appropriate to ours, why is it good for Scotland? People like myself who are not lawyers would like to know. I hope that as we come to page 342 of my who-done-it, the Minister will magically rise to give us the reasons why Scottish law is not appropriate to English law,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to discuss a different factor that has not been aired in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) gave figures of the numbers of people who were kept in custody without being brought to trial. Whether they are in the London area seems irrelevant; they are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>684</span>
people, and whether they live in London, Newcastle upon Tyne or Ormskirk, it is our job as legislators to find some way to bring them to trial as quickly as possible and to settle their lives.

It must be almost worse to be in prison without having been sentenced. The doubts about whether one will be convicted or found innocent must be traumatic, particularly as many people in custody awaiting trial believe that they are innocent, but have no idea what will happen to them when they come to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had letters from the wives of men who are imprisoned without having been convicted saying that the uncertainty is a nerve-racking experience not only for the person in prison, but for his family. Visits to prison by the wife and children are marred when the man has not been convicted. The conversation is overlaid by whether he will return to his family or settle down into a period of custody. Once a man is convicted and accepts it, he settles down to a more orderly, scheduled regime. He can begin not necessarily to accept his situation, but to work it through. Long periods of not knowing one way or the other must be a form of torture which none of us would want to go through. A number of people end up by being released and, are therefore, presumably, innocent, but the experience must leave a great scar on them.

I have just looked again at the excellent document that my right hon. and learned Friend was discussing, " Too Many Prisoners", and I see that NACRO, and the National Association of Probation Officers, and the Howard League for Penal Reform, all very distinguished organisations, all feel that something like the 110-day rule that operates in Scotland could be applied to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate he will not only unlock the door for me, at any rate, and explain the differences between Scottish and English law, but will take into account—as I am sure he does—the uncertainty, difficulty and resultant trauma of the families of individuals in this situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue to which I address myself is that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth (Mr. Ryman). What is the difference between the Scottish and English systems? All that I can tell him is that the Select Committee on Home Affairs made this recommendation in the report on prisons and the Government rejected it in a considered document. The only consideration that was argued by the Government in the course of that document was not that the English and the Scottish systems are different between committal and trial—everybody recognises that they do not have committal in the same way in Scotland—but that if we introduced it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>685</span>
into England the likelihood was that the third criterion by which a judge may allow an extension of time, namely, that there was some other sufficient cause which was not attributable to the fault of the prosecutor, would be used much more widely in England than it is in Scotland, because the delays are longer in England, particularly in London. Therefore, it would not help very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the only reason why the Government are rejecting the clause again, as it seemed to be from the Minister's intervention—I hope that he will consider this point. He mentioned the eight-week rule. I am bound to tell him that, although I have practised in criminal courts, like my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth, and I suspect more than the Minister has, that was the first time I had ever heard of the eight-week rule. The reason why, I suspect, is that one does not have to apply to the courts to adjourn the case for a longer period under the eight-week rule, whereas one would have to under the clause. Therefore the case would have to come before the court. It would have to be argued. The judge would have to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the real difficulty about our present system. Until committal there has to be an appearance before the court every eight days- Even allowing for the change that we have now passed, there will still have to be some mention before the magistrates' court every eight days. Once there is a committal, however, there is no need to mention the case at all between the committal and the trial, apart from the eight-week rule, which I assume means that the court is in some way enabled to extend that period without an appearance in court. If the appearance has to be made, and has to be justified, I suspect that there will be greater pressure to get the case before the court more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what is good about the clause. I recognise, with my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth, that it has this weakness, that because there is no system of committal in Scotland, the pressure is on from the moment of charge to the moment of trial, whereas in England, if the new clause were passed, there would be no pressure until committal, and then the pressure would be from committal to trial. There might, then, be a tendency for the prosecution to argue for a longer period before committal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it really right that there would be no pressure before for committal? There would still be pressure from the defence in the magistrates' court for the prosecution to get on with it. I accept that there may not be a great pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I overstrained the argument. I had already made the point that, up to committal, the appearance before the magistrate gives an opportunity, at any rate, for both sides to apply pressure for committal. In that sense, what we would do if we passed the clause would be to continue the formal system of pressure upon either the prosecution or the defence to get on with it, from the moment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>686</span>
of charge right up to the moment of trial. That it the virtue of the 110-day rule as I see it, even though I recognise, as the Minister recognises, that if we leave in the third qualification it still allows cases in London to be taken outside the 110-day rule if the judge so agrees. But the pressure will be there. The pressure is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we would all agree that any step that we can take consistent with justice to reduce the time that people spend in custody on remand before they are tried, when in the eye of the law they are innocent, should be taken. I do not disagree with anything that has been said about the undesira-bility of people's staying a day longer than is necessary in custody in those circumstances. The May report dwelt upon this at considerable length, and so has almost everybody who has spoken in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires that somebody should be remanded in custody, and it follows from that that we recognise that certain processes have to be allowed to take place before the trial begins. What it comes down to is whether there is anything significant, other than the pressure upon the time and other resources of the court, that is leading to the delays that exist. If there is something significant other than those pressures, other than the backlog of work—for example, dilatoriness on the part of prosecution or of defence lawyers—I see that there is an argument for introducing the 110-day rule or something like it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point let me say that I entirely accept what the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. S. C. Silkin) says, that he is not seeking to import it lock stock and barrel, regardless of the differences in procedure that exist between Scotland and England and Wales, but that he has given his name to the new clause on the basis of the principle. I said that there would then be an argument which I would look at seriously, because the Scottish provision bears directly upon the conduct of the case, which in Scotland, as we know, rests with the prosecution from the moment of charge. It is up to the prosecution to determine then what the timetable shall be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What troubles me, as I have tried to indicate in the course of various speeches, is that we have a procedure here which can provide exactly the same result—the same spur and safeguard. I quite appreciate what was said just now by the hon. Member for York, that under our eight-week rule one does not have to come before the court and say, " I want another adjournment", in the same way that one has to come before a magistrate if one is a police officer and say, " I want another remand in custody", whereas in Scotland evidently one does. Minds have to be addressed perhaps more openly, certainly more publicly, to the question of whether the timetable needs to be postponed or enlarged. I understand that, and I see the force of it. But against that one surely must acknowledge that if application has to be made to the court in the open way which is not required under our eight-week procedure, there is a further pressure upon the time of the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Presumably a hearing has to take place, both sides have to be heard and investigations have to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the eight-week rule—and that, after all, is only 56 days, not 110—is capable of being operated so as to produce exactly the same degree of spur, exactly the same degree of safeguard, as the Scottish 110-day rule. I am not persuaded that in practice this does not happen. What is different is that there are many longer delays here than there are in Scotland, but it does not follow from that that this is because the eight-week rule is inferior to the 110-day rule. We have to ask why it is that, notwithstanding the eight-week rule, there are the delays before coming to trial that exist here which we have identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only difference that the Minister has so far identified between the Scottish system and ours is that in the Scottish system there is a centralised prosecution system. If that be so, and if the effect in Scotland is to reduce the delays considerably below those in England, that may be a strong argument in favour of a centralised prosecution system here. I should like the Minister to comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I wish to comment on the virtues or disadvantages of a centralised prosecuting system at this juncture—I very much doubt whether I should be in order if I were to do so. I acknowledge that the idea is canvassed in the Philips Royal Commission report but I must not be led into that at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the facts suggest that by far and away the greater number of cases in which the eight weeks are extended by the courts in England and Wales are cases in which there has been no delay on the part of the prosecution—or of the defence, come to that—but where the courts, looking at its lists, recognises that there is not a hope in hell of getting the case on within eight weeks. They wish that there were. Here I think it is worth pointing out the progress that has been made. We are often told that the legal profession is disinterested in delay, but in fact I believe that those in the legal profession know better than most laymen the truth of the old saying, which is to be found in Magna Carta, that justice delayed is justice denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already drawn attention to the improvement that has been made. I do not say that there is anything to be complacent about in the figures, but in England and Wales as a whole, whereas in 1979 the average waiting time was just under 83 days, in 1980 it was down to just over 70, and judging from the figures of the quarter ending in December 1981 it looks as though the figure for 1981 is down to about 63 days or 64 days. That is still too long, but it is not very much more than 56 days, or eight weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In London the figures are not so good, I am afraid. The average waiting time in 1979 was 149 days, but the quarter ending in December 1981 shows us that this has come to 102 days or thereabouts. The quarter ending in June 1981 was a little better; the delay then was 94J days. When
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>688</span>
we are talking about London we should also remember the point made by the hon. Member for Blyth (Mr. Ryman), who has considerable experience in the criminal courts both in London and elsewhere, that London is the venue for many very heavy trials, because it has the number of courts and the facilities that courts in the country and in the provinces very rarely have. The Lord Chief Justice, with particular reference to the South-Eastern circuit, and my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor have been devoting a great deal of energy to reducing these times of waiting and with quite substantial success in the last year or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was therefore of particular importance that the hon. Member for Blyth made the points that he did. I do not think that he was taking a narrow view of the amendment and saying that, because the procedural system in Scotland was so different from our own, it could therefore not be imported. As I understood him, he was not taking that view. He was asking how this helped with our system. I think that it was his view that, because it was the backlog of work that was responsible for so much of the delay in London in particular and in the country as a whole, a 110-day procedure or something based upon its principle would not really help because it would not be able to be shown that the fault lay with the prosecution. In other words, there would be an application made for an extension or for the 110-day provision to be disapplied, and that would have to be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) said—I thought also importantly—that in the provinces they often do better than 110 days and that, if we give a 110-day rule in place of the existing 56-day rule, they may very well think that they can take the pressure off now because they do not have to get the cases on so quickly. I rather agree with what he said in conclusion, that the clause reminds us of a problem but it does not provide us with an example which would result in a notable improvement here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman rightly reminded us that the new clause has the very authoritative support of the all-party Penal Affairs Group. I must tell him that my reaction to the new clause is one which has the approval of the Lord Chancellor's Department—we have naturally been in contact on these matters. I also agree with him that, of course, it is important that indictments should be as concise as possible, that everything should not be thrown in, including the kitchen sink, in order to close every possible loophole or bolthole, but that the prosecuting counsel ought to identify the nub of the case and concentrate on that, not load the indictment with all sorts of minor and alternative counts so that it becomes 25 or 30 counts long. I also agree that the number of defendants ought to be kept on a single indictment to the minimum that is consistent with justice being done. Often there has to be a number of defendants on the indictment, otherwise somebody who is not there is blamed and a doubt is raised which would be overcome if more people were on the indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>689</span>
These are difficult matters, but I agree in principle that there is much to be said for keeping indictments as shout and the defendants as few as is possible, consistent with doing justice. I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman was right, if I may respectfully say so, in giving encouragement to that principle during his tenure of office as Attorney-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not believe that, if we were to adopt something on the lines of the 110-day rule that that would make much difference here. Let us suppose that we are coming to the end in a given case of the 110-day period and the presecution finds it necessary to go to court and say that it cannot be ready in time. Even with a hearing of the application which would then take place, I do not believe that it would be other than in a very rare case that the court would say " Well, why don't you split the indictment? Why don't you have fewer people? It is your fault. You can come on in if you do that." In a case where counsel say that it is important to have so many people and so many counts but that they are not able to get it on in time, I do not believe that that would have much influence upon the length of the indictment or the number of defendants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am afraid I have to be discouraging, as I have been in the past—and this aspect has been raised notably by the hon. Member for Orms-kirk—only because I want to see trials got on as quickly as possible. I do not think that this proposal will help. It would not make any difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is that the 110-day limit would concentrate the minds of those who work in the system or the courts and of the Government. It is said that those who work in the system would have to ensure that they worked efficiently, and the Government would have to ensure that sufficient resources were available to enable the courts to cope with the demands on them. We are under no doubts as to our obligations there and considerable progress has been made, notably under the aegis of my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor. It takes time to plan and build courts and to recruit staff to service them and judges to sit in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have increased expenditure on law and order, but economic constraints have to apply even here. In the short term, in any event, some defendants might even spend longer in custody because of the time taken hearing applications under the 110-day rule and because of the point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead referring to cases in the provinces. It has not been mentioned at all during the course of the debate that it would also mean that defendants who were not in custody but on bail might well have to wait even longer before their trials came on. We all know that there are, unhappily, cases where people have to wait sometimes for over a year on bail before their cases come up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also the view of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure that there should not be a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>690</span>
time limit of this kind. The Royal Commission examined a number of overseas systems which have this sort of time limit, including the United States, where one was introduced by the Federal Speedy Trial Act. Experience with that measure suggests that the speed with which cases are brought to trial is determined almost entirely by the volume of business and the resources available to deal with it, and representatives of the legal profession here, certainly the chairman of the Bar and the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, who gave evidence to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, see no real advantage in such a development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be of interest to the Committee to hear what the chairman of the Bar said on that occasion:
	<br><q><p>"My knowledge of the Speedy Trial Act in the United States, which mirrors the Scottish 110-day rule, is simply that it is thought to act in those areas where the courts were already up with their work. It did not work in those areas where the courts were not up in their work and they simply used a series of exceptions which had got to be written into the Speedy Trial Act, and in some instances it went to the Federal Court simply saying ' Either we do not prosecute at all or we say to the State Police they have to prosecute under their legislation and we will not trouble under ours.' It simply fiddles the edge in another direction; that is all."</p></q>
Interposing there, I think that there is a parallel with the Scottish situation. Perhaps it has something to do with a centralised prosecuting system. The Scots do not have the backlog in their courts which we unfortunately have. It may be that they have more courts or it may be for some other reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to reduce waiting times, the Crown courts need to be able to handle more cases more quickly. I mentioned what my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor has done. New courtrooms have been opened, more circuit judges have been appointed, circuit judges from other areas have volunteered to sit for up to a month at a time in London where the pressures are greatest. We are also trying to make the trial a more efficient process and to encourage early and careful preparation of cases by prosecution and defence through improvements in procedure and in the system of criminal legal aid. The legal profession itself—I refer again to what the hon. Member for Blyth said—has developed what is loosely called the summons for direction in criminal cases, in which everybody has a look at what the issues are likely to be, analyses them, identifies them, and agrees on what can be discarded and what actually is central to the issue that will occupy the trial. That has saved a great deal of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures that have been taken so far, combined with the strong lead given by the Lord Chief Justice, have reduced waiting times in custody by as much as a third in London and by a quarter elsewhere. There is, of course, further to go. Having examined carefully the merits of the proposal, and listened carefully to what has been said—I have not referred to the speech of the hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson)—I do not think that this matter turns essentially upon the differences of procedure between Scotland and ourselves. I believe that it turns much more upon the difference in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>691</span>
backlog and the business of the courts in Scotland and here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not able to tell the Committee that this is an innovation which we ought to accept. The introduction of such a provision would, I suggest, not only fail to improve the position of those who are awaiting trial, but might, by imposing fresh burdens on the courts, make matters worse. I know that that is not the belief of those who moved the new clause, and still less is it their intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that I have the advantage in the Committee of not being a lawyer, so I am perhaps able to see matters, if not more clearly, certainly in a different light from most of the hon. and learned Members here. I do not have to worry about my tackle, whatever that may happen to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perhaps a fault of not having the legal experience which hon. and learned Members so frequently allude to in our debates, but I cannot see why it is necessary to remand into custody so many people. I cannot see why it is necessary to do it when such a high proportion of them are subsequently found not guilty or given non-custodial sentences. I cannot see why it is necessary to remand in custody for such inordinately long periods of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it to be unacceptable and indefensible that there should, for example, be so many individuals who have been awaiting trial for over a year. There were, in fact, 100 of these people in September 1980. I find unacceptable and indefensible that, in September 1981, 10 people should have been waiting for over two years to come to trial, that a man had been waiting for over 600 days, subsequently to be found not guilty, and that another man had been waiting two and a half years, subsequently to be found not guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly cannot accept that it is necessary in England and Wales for there to be at any one time something like 900 men and women awaiting trial for longer than 110 days—longer, that is to say, than they would have been required to wait on remand in custody had they been more fortunate in being held in custody across the border in Scotland. If it is possible, by whatever legal mechanisms at their disposal, to ensure that people are tried quickly and more efficiently in Scotland, it should be equally possible to do the same in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the argument advanced by many hon. and hon. and learned Gentlemen that it is not always appropriate to make transplants from one political or legal system to another. I accept that entirely I put forward the argument for the 110-day rule more as a matter of advancing a principle than as the advocacy of that particular method. Nevertheless, I do not accept the arguments that have been advanced against the proposal by the Minister, or any other hon. and hon. and learned Members who have spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reason that the proposal has wide support both inside and outside the House of Commons, not least among probation officers and others, I want the question to be voted on and I

The proposal enshrined in the new clauses was first advanced and first canvassed by the Government in May last year in the document " Review of Parole in England and Wales ". Although Ministers spent a considerable amount of time advocating this course, I accept that they never at any time said that there was a firm commitment to introducing it in practice, though they spent a large amount of their energies suggesting that this was the most desirable and radical reform that could be introduced at this time as a means of substantially reducing the prison population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government took us up the hill with this proposal. They stopped and dropped us there, but whilst they were marching up the hill they attracted a great measure of support. They had the support of the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group and of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. Both bodies supported the proposal for automatic supervised release, not just because it would make a substantial difference to the prison population—reducing it to about 7,000, it is estimated by the Home Office —but also because of the intrinsic merits of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now considerable acceptance that there is no evidence to show that shorter sentences cannot properly be introduced which at the same time would not endanger the public and would be of benefit to the offender. There is a general acceptance by those who are knowledgeable and informed about penal affairs—not least by the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor—that it is both necessary and desirable to shorten the length of prison sentences, and that doing so would have no real deleterious effect on the safety of the public and might substantially help a particular offender to be rehabilitated back into the community, and therefore reduce his chances of being reconvicted and given a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also some evidence—not a great deal but the glimmerings of a case can be made—in favour of the argument that supervision of an offender in the community, allied with the threat of recall to prison, may actually lessen the chances of that offender committing further offences. If that is the case, and the evidence is that already provided by the Home Office, it would seem to be a very powerful argument for a form of supervised release.

If there is some evidence which shows that if, instead of keeping a man in prison, he is put into the community under supervision, and has held over him for a period of time the threat of being recalled to prison if he does not behave himself, and that that lessens the chances of him committing further offences, we ought to embark on a scheme of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal as advocated by the Government and supported by the two all-party groups and now enshrined in this new clause is not necessarily designed specifically to reduce sentences themselves so much as to replace a custodial sentence with a different kind of sentence. Indeed, the expression
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>694</span>
used by the Minister himself in a not very well-remembered or publicised debate which perhaps we shall have an opportunity to refer to again and again and again on subsequent occasions suggested that it was a new sentence of custody plus supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the Minister himself who made the point that the supervision part in the community was very much a part and was to be seen and considered to be a part of the sentence. Again, the introduction of this automatic supervised release-on-parole scheme would enable the parole scheme itself to be strengthened by giving time to be concentrated on those at the longer end of sentences, for more consideration to be concentrated on their particular problems. It would further have the advantage of reducing the prison population—reducing it by a very substantial amount, according to the Home Office estimate of something like 7,000—at a time when our prison population is not only excessively high, well above the limits of tolerance, greatly in excess of the certified normal accommodation, enormously exceeding what would be the desirable numbers in prison if we are to have any semblance of a reasonable, civilised and humane prison system for those who are contained within it. Not only do we not have that, but the numbers are increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know—we have debated it here and I would be the first to pay testimony to the fact—that the lengths of prison sentences has actually declined. There is the exhortation provided by the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor and the lead given by the Lord Chief Justice, and not least the example set in the cases of Upton and Bibi, that the lengths of prison sentences have marginally declined. That is something we accept and we all welcome. But the Government do not rely, nor should they, on the impact—the marginal impact—that that would have upon the prison population, because we have the evidence of the deputy director of the Prison Service to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A gentleman by the name of David Faulkner wrote an article which appeared in the October 1981 edition of the journal of the Association of Members of Boards of Visitors. On that occasion Mr. Faulkner wrote in words which I am sure will now be incredibly embarrassing to the Home Office Ministers, when he said:
	<br><q><p>"We also welcome the emphasis on shorter sentences and the lead which the Lord Chief Justice has given in the Upton and Bibi judgments last year. We cannot at this stage say whether they are having a measurable effect, but the population figures show that if they are having an effect it is only to reduce the rate of increase which would otherwise have taken place."</p></q>
That is the deputy director of the Prison Service actually throwing a little bit of cold water on the lead which was given in the Upton and Bibi cases, saying that the population figures showed that they were having an effect if only to reduce the rate of increase which would otherwise have occurred. Mr. Faulkner continued, more importantly:
	<br><q><p>"This is why the Prison Department is relying on the proposals for an extension of the parole scheme which would enable offenders with sentences too short to qualify
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>695</span>
for parole to be released under supervision after serving one-third of their sentences."</p></q>
I wonder what the Minister will put in its place. Here we have the deputy director of the prison service saying that that is why the Prison Department is relying upon the proposals for an extension of the parole scheme. At that time it looked to be a reasonable assumption on his part. Certainly the Government and individual Ministers were making great play about this new, sensible, desirable, efficient, radical, new scheme which they were introducing—even going so far as to enable the deputy director of the prison service to say in public that he was relying upon this scheme to reduce the prison population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those remarks were made in October 1981 and are as valid now, if not more so. The prison population has risen from 40,800 on 31st December to 44,073 on 12 March last—a rise of 3,300 in the last 	<i>2\</i> months. The argument for the introduction of a scheme of automatic supervised release on parole has much to do with the impact it would have in reducing the prison population. When prison and borstal governors are making public statements about the deleterious effects of the increase, when they are drawing the attention of the public to what they regard as the inhuman and degrading conditions in prisons, when the Government and everyone else accept that conditions are intolerable, it would seem only sensible and desirable to use a scheme of this kind, which the Government have advanced and supported on the ground that it will reduce the prison population without endangering the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some arguments have been advanced against the specific scheme. I will leave those to the Minister to deploy. He will know, because he has beaten them down on a previous occasion, that none has any serious substance or validity. The arguments that have been advanced against the introduction of this scheme are flimsy, so say the least. The Minister on previous occasions has acknowledged that, although I do not imagine that he will feel able to make the same acknowledgment today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments in favour of the scheme are irrestible and nowhere better expressed than by the Minister on 23rd July 1981, when answering his hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, Southwest (Mr. Budgen), who is the Whip on the Committee. That answer was probably the best and most powerful case advanced in favour of the proposal in the new clause. I have only just resisted the temptation to read out that speech, word for word, pretending it to be mine. However, I have it available and have not forgotten any of it. I hope that if the Minister attempts to use the arguments tonight that his hon. Friend then used and which the Minister completely destroyed, he will find that the speech that he made on 23 July which was so effective in destroying the arguments of his hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, Southwest, will be equally effectively deployed against him tonight.

There is no reason, except perhaps the Home Secretary's and the Minister's cowardice in the face of a couple of judges sitting in private—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says " Come on ". I do not know what he means by that, but if he is asserting that that is not the case we have his own testimony to prove the opposite; because it was he, after all, who told us on a previous occasion, in another debate, that the decision had been taken by the judiciary. No one else was opposed to the scheme. There are no other arguments to deploy. We have the testimony of, I believe, Lord Justice Lawton, on the " Panorama " programme, who said that he was consulted with two or three others and that that was the limit of the consultation. That was the strength of the veto that was imposed on this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary in May last year said, that it was a fabulous idea. He said that he had the scheme which would reduce the prison population by 7,000 and bring the prison population down to a tolerable, humane level, without endangering 	<i>the</i> public. This was the scheme, and everybody rallied in support, then suddenly five judges had second thoughts, and the Home Secretary capitulated. We still believe it to be a good scheme. We still believe it to be sensible and desirable; therefore we are pressing it tonight and if the Minister does not accept it we shall force the matter to a division later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that because we have been around this course before in our deliberations, particularly on the clause dealing with partially suspended sentences, I shall not be accused of discourtesy if I do not deal at length with the case put forward again for early release or supervised release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the hon. Gentleman has done me the courtesy of referring to a speech I made on 23 July 1981, I will so far offend against the conventions as to quote one sentence from it myself. The sentence is:
	<br><q><p>"We shall, of course, pay close attention to reactions to the review—both within the House and outside—in deciding whether to ask Parliament, in due course, to approve a scheme along these lines "—(	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 July 1981; Vol. 9, c. 694).</p></q>
That is exactly what my right hon. Friend and the Government have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have paid attention to reactions to the review and if that is to be characterised as cowardice, in paying attention to so disinterested and considerable a group of people—it would seem, merely the people who actually pass the sentences—I must bear those strictures with as much philosophy as I can muster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in his foreword to the review said:
	<br><q><p>"The Government has as yet come to no conclusion on that question"</p></q>
—he was referring to the question that we could, with safety, introduce an early release scheme. He went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"or on whether any other changes are desirable, but I believe that it will be most helpful to Parliament and the public to have this document available as a basis for informed discussion of these matters ".</p></q>
Naturally, at that time we wanted to do something to overcome the anomaly that we discussed the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>697</span>
other day, when we were dealing with the clause that proposed a reduction of the threshold of parole. As we recognise in the Committee, under our existing arrangements the ringleader of some plot who gets three years for his pains, and who is eligible for parole and gets it after he has served one-third, a year in prison, will come out of prison on the same day as the person who took a minor part in that conspiracy and was sentenced to 18 months and therefore was not eligible for parole. Each will come out on the same day, after 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was that anomaly, to which attention had especially been drawn by Lord Justice Waller and the advisory committee, that we wanted in particular to overcome. We believed that this was the means by which that could be achieved. I shall not conceal from the Committee what was always in the mind of the right hon. Gentleman and myself—that by the same means we could make a reduction in the prison population without doing injustice or leading to danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have actually learned is that people said it was a good idea to try to overcome the anomaly about parole, but that it was not good to go about it in this way. Why did they say that? It was because it was a blanket release scheme as distinct from a selective one. Everybody, as the scheme was propounded in the review of parole, violent offenders or non-violent offenders, short or long within the maximum of three years, was to be entitled equally to its benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was made clear to us by the judiciary, the magistrates, the judges, the recorders and Crown courts at an important sentencing seminar in Roe-hampton in the autumn, and by the Lord Chief Justice and other members of the judiciary, that there was a danger here unless an element of discretion was given to the judges to disapply the scheme in certain cases—for example, violent offenders; there was a danger here that certain courts would say that there would be a danger to the public if somebody for whom they thought three years was the right sentence, taking account of the safety of the public and the gravity of what he has done, was going to be let out after 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger that they pointed out to us was that courts, in those circumstances, believing it to be their duty to the community they serve would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>698</span>
enlarge the nominal length of the sentence so as to secure a longer time actually served in custody if the scheme were to be introduced. That was what was pointed out to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rubbish to talk about two judges sitting together, cooking up an opposition to this. It is absolute rubbish—it is worse than rubbish; it is a pernicious perversion of the truth and a damaging one too. There was no objection to what my right hon. Friend said at the outset in the foreword of this report that he would consult, none at all. It was obviously right that we should consult those who pass the sentences. Nor was there the slightest question of there being any disloyalty on their part to the will of Parliament; the judges in this country have always implemented the will of Parliament and there is no better illustration of that than the way in which the parole system is operated. There is no suggestion that sentences, because of the parole system, have been enlarged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject with some resentment the criticisms that have been made of the judiciary in answering our inquiries and advising in the way in which they did. We have been round the course before. Now the Government have given an undertaking that they will take powers to reduce the threshold level for parole, and we have now introduced the partially-suspended sentence scheme which has received the approval of the Committee and will, in our belief, have the great advantage of being selective. If we had given powers of selection, or if we had given powers to disapply in the early release scheme, the more discretion to disapply we had given the less saving there would have been in prison places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that this combination which we have now moved to of reducing the threshold for parole when it is proper to do so and introducing partially-suspended sentences is far and away superior to the early release scheme which at first we espoused, for reasons which have been given, but which we were persuaded by sound and proper advice was not consistent with the safety of the public and with the justice of a great many cases. It is for those reasons that I must invite the Committee once again to reject the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
