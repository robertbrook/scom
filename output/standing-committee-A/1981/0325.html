	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF COURTS TO COMMIT OFFENDERS TO OTHER COURTS FOLLOWING DEFERMENT OF SENTENCE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'Where a magistrates' court has deferred passing sentence on an offender under section 1 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1) of that section, the court may, instead of passing sentence itself, commit the offender to the Crown Court for Sentence in accordance with Section 56 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 or any of the enactments to which that section applies.</p>
	<p>(2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2) of section 1 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973, the Crown Court may defer passing sentence in accordance with that section on an offender who has been committed to the Crown Court for sentence in accordance with section 56 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 or any of the enactments to which that section applies following a deferment of sentence by the magistrates' court.</p>
	<p>(3) In section 1(8) of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973, the words "does not extend to committing him to another court for sentence but, subject to that" shall be omitted.'.— 	<i>[Mr. Kilroy-Silk.]</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause would enable a magistrates' court which has deferred passing sentence on an offender to commit him to the Crown court for sentence at the end of the period of deferment. Like many other new clauses that I have moved in the Committee, it embodies a recommendation of the all-party Penal Affairs Group in its report "Too Many Prisoners". It has the support of the Justices' Clerks' Society and of the Magistrates' Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 1 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 gives the courts powers to defer the passing of a sentence on an offender for up to six months, to enable the sentence to be deferred for up to six months, in order to enable the court to have regard to the conduct of an offender after he is convicted and to take into account whether he has made any reparation for his offence or whether there has been any change in his circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the decision to defer the passing of a sentence contains the clear implication that if at the end of the period of deferment the offender can show that there has been a change in circumstances or that he has made some form of reparation, or indeed, that a favourable report on the offender can be made back to the court, the court will, as a consequence, impose a more lenient sentence than it would otherwise have done had it been compelled to impose a sentence immediately rather than deferring it. Therefore, the power to defer sentence enables the court to have the option to impose less severe sentences than perhaps it might have felt obliged to impose if it had no alternative but to sentence the offender immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
In 1975, in the Gilby case, an 18-year-old youth was convicted of burglary. The magistrates deferred sentence, but when the offender came back to the magistrates for sentence to be imposed they had received a very adverse report from his probation officer. The magistrates therefore committed the offender to the Crown court for sentence with a recommendation that he be sentenced to borstal training, and indeed a borstal training sentence was imposed by the Crown court. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeal held that once the magistrates' court had deferred sentence it could not thereafter commit an offender to the Crown court for sentence. In 1977, the Criminal Law Act amended section 1 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 in order to put this decision in a statutory form. New clause 47 would reverse that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, as I am sure the Minister is well aware, the choice between the imposition of a substantial custodial sentence and perhaps the bold step of imposing a probation order is relatively narrow, or so I am advised, not having had experience in the courts in any form. I am told by the Magistrates' Association that despite appearances to the contrary, there can be quite a narrow dividing line between, on the one hand, the imposition of a fairly severe, certainly a heavy, custodial sentence and the imposition of a probation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in such borderline cases, the magistrates say that they often wish to defer sentence where they would otherwise commit the offender to the Crown court with a view to the imposition of a substantial custodial sentence. They prefer to defer it to see whether they can actually avoid a custodial sentence because of some potential change in the offender or his circumstances or the implementation of some promise of reparation or of another kind made by the offender at the time of his trial. However, the Crown court cannot ignore the possibility that the offender will not live up to his promises, in which case it may consider that a substantial custodial sentence is justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the Gilby case is that in those circumstances the courts cannot defer sentence without losing the option of committing the offender to the Crown court at the end of the period of deferment. As the Justices' Clerks' Society pointed out in its statement "Sentencing in the 1980s":
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of the present law is to discourage magistrates from deferring sentence in situations when it might have been most desirable to do so and to encourage magistrates to commit in custody for sentence forthwith when they might otherwise have wished to take a more lenient course."</p></blockquote>
It is, of course, possible that the Crown court would decide to defer sentence but, if it did, it has been held that committals to the Crown court should normally be in custody, and this period in custody may effectively kill the chances of a successful deferment because it increases the chances of the offender losing his job or whatever hopeful future development has induced the magistrate to defer passing sentence in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only solution to all that, therefore, is to reverse the effects of the Gilby judgment, as this new clause would do, so as to allow magistrates to commit to the Crown court following a deferment. This would encourage magistrates to offer a chance of redemption more frequently than they perhaps are now able to do, and particularly to those offenders who might be on the brink of a substantial custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
I know that the Minister has been listening avidly and carefully to every word I have uttered in the five minutes during which we have debated this matter. I hope that he has been able to give very careful consideration to the arguments in favour of the new clause and that he will be able to indicate, if it is not for some reason possible to accept it in its present form today, that nevertheless he goes along with the spirit of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the new clause, as the hon. Gentleman explained in his speech, to which I listened with greater care than he is now listening to mine is to amend section 1 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act to enable a magistrates' court which has deferred passing sentence on an offender subsequently to commit that offender to the Crown court for sentence after the period of deferment has elapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of some technicality and fairly fine judgment. I am glad that the new clause has given us an opportunity to discuss the courts' power to defer sentence. Deferment is a useful power, the availability of which is not perhaps as widely appreciated as it might be outside the immediate circle of practitioners in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 1 of the Act, the Crown court or a magistrates' court may defer passing sentence on an offender with his consent for a period of up to six months from the date of conviction, but they may only defer passing sentence once. The aim is to help the court to select the appropriate sentence by taking into account the conduct of the offender after conviction, usually after some expected change in his circumstances of which evidence has been given such as, for example, obtaining employment, arranging accommodation, getting married, or something like that, or where the offender has promised to make voluntary reparation. In other words, the courts say, "All right. We have heard what you say and what is said about you. We think that for the moment we shall defer making up our minds as to what is the appropriate sentence until we see how you get on in the next two months."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the section provides also that the offender may be sentenced by the same court or by a different court before the period of expiration of deferment if he is convicted of another offence during that period. It also prevents the court from committing an offender for sentence to another court once it has made the decision to defer passing sentence, and that is what the new clause is really about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is designed to remove the effect of a ruling that was made in the case the Crown against Gilby, which prevented a magistrates' court which has deferred passing sentence from thereafter committing the offender to the Crown court for sentence at the end of deferment. That was a judgment the effect of which was subsequently incorporated in the Powers of Criminal Courts Act by an amendment made during the passage of the Criminal Law Act 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that both the Magistrates' Association and the Justices' Clerks' Society continually feel that the effect of the Gilby judgment, now given statutory force, is to impose an unjustified restriction on the use by magistrates' courts of the deferment power. This is that this may lead to courts committing offenders to custody where they might otherwise defer sentence. The possible implications
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
of this for the prison population have also been noted by the all-party Penal Affairs Group, as has been mentioned, and have led it to recommend an amendment on the lines that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is really a question of whether, having deferred and having taken into account how the offender has got on during the period of deferment, the courts are to be given back the power, which they normally have, to commit to the Crown court someone whom they believe needs more than the magistrates' courts are entitled to award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Gilby, the Court of Appeal said that the decision to commit for sentence is based on the magistrates' consideration of the nature of the offence and the character and previous history of the offender. All the relevant data are available at the moment of conviction and if, in all the circumstances, the courts judge the case to be appropriate for sentence by the Crown court, it should commit for sentence and leave to the Crown court the decision whether to defer passing sentence, because the Crown court also has that jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While subsequent behaviour may properly influence the level of sentence imposed by the deferring court—within its own powers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that this is a difficult and technical subject and I hesitate to interrupt the hon. and learned Gentleman in the middle of his analysis, but is not this precisely one of the difficulties? If the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that the Crown court has the power to defer sentence, it really does not matter if the power is left as it is? That is one of the problems about committing to the Crown court for sentence—that such committal will inevitably be in custody, and therefore one of the advantages of a deferred sentence will have been destroyed by having to hold the person in custody, perhaps destroying his job, his employment prospects, his accommodation, or whatever else may be disrupted by even a relatively short period of custody. That is a substantial argument in itself for the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that in the vast majority of cases someone is committed to the Crown court in custody for sentence, though it is open to a court to commit him on bail. There is a point there, but none the less it is right that the Crown court should have, and should continue to have, the right to defer sentence, even in a case in which the offender has been committed by the magistrates' court in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of the Court of Appeal, while subsequent behaviour may properly influence the level of sentence imposed by a court which has deferred sentencing, it should not reopen the initial decision as to whether the case was not of such a kind as to merit the more severe sentences available to the Crown court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where the matter of judgment becomes rather finely balanced. On the one hand if it is all right to take into account how the offender has got on during the period in which he has been released under deferment of sentence, when considering how much to give him when he comes back for ultimate sentencing, why should it not be all right to take that into account when considering whether or not he ought to be sent for sentence to the Crown court, with the wider range of sentences available to it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I see the force of the argument, and it seems powerful, that the circumstances of the offence,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
the character of the offender and his record up until now, are the matters which really pertain to whether he should be sent to the Crown court for sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the fine balance to which the Minister is referring. Do not magistrates themselves take the view that they would be able to use this power more frequently? Whether they are right or wrong, what would they feel if the proposal made by my hon. Friend were incorporated in the law? Is that not a very important factor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it plainly is. We always seek to pay close attention to what the Magistrates' Association urges upon us. We adopt an extremely well-informed and sophisticated approach to these matters. What the right hon. and learned Gentleman says is perfectly true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting once again. My right hon. and learned Friend has said that it is a matter of fine balance. If that is so, we have evidence that the Magistrates' Association and the Justices' Clerks' Society, both of whose members are intimately involved in proposing this power, are clearly on one side of that fine balance. Who is on the other side?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a matter once debated during the passage of the 1977 Act. It emerged then, no doubt as a result of consultations carried out by the previous Government, that the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, was, on balance, in favour of upholding the Gilby judgment. The intention of the new clause is no doubt to enable the magistrates' courts to defer sentences in cases where they would otherwise commit in the hope that they may then be able to pass a sentence within their powers. It follows from such a power that the court might subsequently commit to the Crown court for sentence in a case where they might not otherwise have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would not necessarily seem right in principle. Where an offender knows that the power to commit to the Crown court would be hanging over his head during a period of deferment, he may well be reluctant to agree to deferment of sentence, and thus some of the value of the power would be negated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be an arguable case in principle for ensuring that the court, which passes the eventual sentence, should be the one which also takes the decision to defer. That would not be the case if sentencing could be carried out by the Crown court following a decision to defer by the magistrates' court. It is perhaps to counteract this effect that the new clause proposes that the Crown court should be allowed to defer sentence on an offender who had been committed to it for sentence after having already served a period of deferment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is salutary to note that if this were not the case we would be replacing an apparent restriction on the power of the magistrates' court by a real restriction on the power of the Crown court. The prospect of an offender having to face two periods of deferment is not a happy one. The Advisory Council on the Penal System, which first put forward the idea of the deferred sentence, recommended strongly that it should be a once-and-for-all power, not least so that a person subject to a deferred sentence should know that he cannot buy more time when he comes up for sentence. We agree with that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned that the Lord Chief Justice, at the time of the 1977 Act's passage through Parliament, expressed
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
himself in favour, on balance, of upholding the Gilby judgment. That was strongly influential in persuading the last Government to make statutory, in that Act, the effect of the Gilby judgment. The arguments were then, and are now, finely balanced. Having heard the way in which the hon. Gentleman has put it, we should like to give further thought to the matter, and consult again upon it. Although I cannot give any commitment as to our ultimate course of action, if that indication is sufficient to enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause, that might be the most convenient way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful once again for the reasonable and positive way in which the Minister has responded to the new clause and the arguments which have been advanced in support of it. In the light of the undertaking that he has given to consider the matter again and to come back to it at a later stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the new clause be read a second time. The new clause in the name of myself and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) prohibits the imprisonment of maintenance defaulters. Several times during the proceedings in the Committee myself and my hon. Friends have tried to increase the number of noncustodial offences—that is, offences such as cannabis-using, prostitution, drunks who are fine defaulters, and vagrants, to name but a few—where we consider that imprisonment is a totally unsuitable form of sentence. In the individual debates that we have had, the Minister has agreed to look again at vagrants and prostitutes as being unsuitable for prison; but he did not agree to think again on cannabis users and drunks who are fine defaulters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although in each of these cases we are usually told that the actual number in prison is not very large, I asked the Minister for the number of drunks who are fine defaulters at present in prison, and he said that he would let me have it in due course. The number that I have been given is approximately 2,000, which is quite a large number at any one point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may want to argue that number with me. He said that he would send it to me, but I can only quote the number that I have been given, and am still waiting for his figure. If one adds together the cannabis users, the prostitutes, the drunks who are fine defaulters, the maintenance defaulters and the vagrants, I should like to know what the number would be, but I believe that it would run into a few thousand. If he wants to argue with that, I should be pleased to hear his figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, then, talking about a whole group of people who, collectively, take up a great many prison places, and spend a lot of the taxpayers' money. The more of these people that we can get out of prison, the better. I refer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
again to the Home Secretary's comment that we should reserve prison for those who are a danger to society. I do not see that maintenance defaulters fall into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1979, 2,452 people were received into prison for non-payment of maintenance, or for arrears under an affiliation order. In view of the extreme overcrowding and the cost of the prison service, this seems to me a waste of administrative time, and it does not contribute to reducing the prison population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maintenance is a civil debt, unlike other types of fine default that we have considered. Maintenance defaulters are not criminals who have been fined and are defaulting on that fine. Several studies have concluded that the imprisonment of maintenance defaulters is administratively burdensome, economically wasteful and juridically wrong. The Payne committee report on the enforcement of judgment debts led in 1969 to the abolition of imprisonment for all forms of civil debt other than maintenance default. Before that, in 1958, the then Home Secretary—the late Lord Butler or Mr. Butler as he was then—spoke strongly against putting maintenance defaulters in prison. He said—and I know that all members of the Committee respect the intellect and judgment of the late Lord Butler—that imprisonment
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"seems to me not only a futile operation,"—</p></blockquote>
he was referring to imprisonment for maintenance defaulters—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but positively harmful. It gets no money for the woman, because the man ceases to earn while in prison. It loses the man his job, and the country his productive capacity. It exposes a defaulter to what I must say, with emphasis, is the contamination of prison—but not to any reformative influences. It occupies time and space in prison ... It also takes up a considerable amount of public money."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 December 1957; Vol. 579, c. 1542.]</p></blockquote>
He said that as Home Secretary in 1957, and I do not think that the situation has changed since he made that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then we have had the Finer committee report on one-parent families in 1974. That report—which is often quoted as a report of some worth—recommended the abolition of imprisonment for maintenance defaulters. The report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everyone agrees that sending maintenance defaulters to prison is an essay in social and economic futility as far as the taxpayer is concerned."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

often to the House, of bringing about substantial changes in the way we sentence people and in the type of sentences we offer them. Therefore, we must think again very carefully about the way in which we sentence people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing that has changed is the prison population. It certainly was not at the crisis level at that time that it is now, and, as far as we can see, it will get worse, according to the estimates made in the Budget provision for prison places.

These things have to be considered afresh. We must not totally close our mind to what should be custodial offences and what should not under one Government and then say that we shall never ever change our view on this point. I believe that many people who might have considered it inappropriate at that time would want to take out of prison these categories that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady invited me to say who had expressed the opinion on behalf of the last Government that imprisonment should be retained. I am now able to help her. It was the hon. Lady herself, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Imprisonment, in fact, is used as a sanction in a number of other non-criminal matters. It may be imposed for default in the payment of debts such as rates, income tax and legal aid contributions."</p></blockquote>
To be fair, she says at the end:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Other arguments have been put by one hon. Member or another. In conclusion, although it is difficult to come down on one side or the other, I recommend that the Committee should not accept the amendment."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 27 April 1978; c. 102-3.]</p></blockquote>
Of course, people can change their minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was I actually talking on the amendment about maintenance defaulters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So I understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not actually quote anything that I said in relation to maintenance defaulters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well the hon. Lady said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon. Friend the Member for Barking pointed out that the Finer Committee had recommended abolition of imprisonment. It said in its report that there was no specific evidence that it is a deterrent. However, as has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Miss Boothroyd) the Home Office in 1974 carried out an informal survey which showed that the threat of imprisonment is highly effective. It was carried out in six magistrates' courts, and it showed that in nearly 90 per cent, of the cases in which a suspended committal warrant was issued the defaulter did not actually go to prison. It is safe to say that in most cases this was because the defaulter paid up.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If imprisonment were abolished, the only remaining sanctions available would be attachment of earnings and distress on goods. Attachment of earnings is a useful sanction against a man who is in regular employment, but it is completely useless if a man is self-employed, and is ineffective against men who frequently change their jobs or who are unemployed or on part time work. The remedy of distress on goods is effective only where the defaulter has sufficient goods to seize, and there may be difficulties in ascertaining what are his goods. If imprisonment were abolished—and this point has been put many times—there would be no real sanction left in many cases and it seems likely that very little money would be recovered, with consequent hardship for the wife and children involved." —[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 27 April 1978; c. 101.] So it was slap on the point.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summer-skill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I believe that in Home Office matters there is always a good case for and a good case against every issue that is discussed. There is always the balance. That is why it is such a difficult Department because one has to weigh up the arguments for and against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the prison population is now at crisis point. Many categories of people in prison should not be there. This would seem now to be a group of people who could be taken out without a danger or threat to society. I am not saying that the arguments that the Minister has just made are now totally irrelevant, but we must say whether we want to take this step to reduce the prison population. I agree that the attachment of earnings orders are not satisfactory. They are not totally effective. They are not always used as they could be used. They cannot be used against certain types of earner, where one cannot technically have an attachment of earnings order. Changes in the procedure of the attachment of earnings order have been recommended by the Payne committee, so that it would be more effective. That is another question—how to make the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971 more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1978, the House of Commons Expenditure Committee stated that the application of community service orders should be extended to cases of default in payment of fines and maintenance orders. That is consistent with what the Opposition have been saying during our debates, that if we can find non-custodial methods of dealing with people who are now in prison, wherever possible they should be used. So we have the House of Commons Expenditure Committee and also the Payne committee on the enforcement of judgment debts recommending the establishment of an enforcement office which would be responsible for enforcing most judgments and orders for the payment of money, including maintenance orders in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act the Government recognised that in extreme circumstances they must provide for taking these people out of prison. That gives the Home Secretary powers to notify any magistrates' court that it may not imprison people for default in monetary payments. I know that the power has not yet been used but it was put in with, presumably, this group or a similar group of people in mind—the sort of people who, if the prison population became absolutely explosive, could be taken out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I think that we should reconsider the possibility of taking this group of people out of prison, along with the other groups that we have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I well understand the reasons why we wish to take categories of offence and categories of behaviour out of the imprisonable area but I believe, from my own professional experience and more limited experience as a Member of this House with people coming to me with their problems, that it would be unwise to remove this ultimate sanction from the enforcement of maintenance orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady has said, there is always a balance to be struck in these matters. It is quite plain that her view
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
has varied—and not dishonourably varied—over a period of time, probably because she had the responsbility earlier and is now able to put forward possible alternatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an alternative proposed by many individuals and organisations, not least the Home Affairs Select Committee. It is that there ought to be more effective enforcement machinery and while we retain the option of imprisonment for a maintenance defaulter, no effort will be made to establish more effective machinery which will actually get the maintenance arrears paid, which is presumably what we all want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The desirability of a more effective enforcement machine is something with which we should all agree, but there is no logical link between that and removing the sanction of imprisonment in cases where it may be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite the contrary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. and learned Friend says, quite the contrary. I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman will give us the benefit of his views—as he has so often—on the new clause. However, it is important for him to realise that unfortunately there is a significant number of cases in which those against whom maintenance has been ordered have decided in their own minds that, come hell or high water, they will not pay a penny and will do everything possible to avoid doing so. I know that is the case, both through some 15 years of professional experience, during which I have practised partly in this area, and through people bringing sad cases to my advice centres, explaining how their husbands simply refuse to maintain them and do everything possible to avoid doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there are cases in which maintenance orders cause hardship for husbands, and in that kind of case no sensible tribunal would seek to send them to prison. But in cases of deliberate refusal—unfortunately, knowing human nature, that happens, and although it does not happen in the majority of cases it is not infrequent—it is important to retain the ultimate sanction of imprisonment. We should be extremely unwise and we should do wives and children a grave disservice if we went down the road of removing that ultimate sanction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to give my support to my hon. Friend's new clause. I too shall try to be brief if for no other reason than to prevent the Minister from having the opportunity of dredging up something that I may have said in the past. I think that he would be unlikely to, because I have always taken the view that the exception to the general principle which the Payne committee enunciated is not one that I could defend. I am not particularly dismayed by the fact that a few years ago the view which the Home Office put forward was different. Indeed, it might well strengthen my feelings about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite see the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. It is one which one always hears and is none the worse for having been put so clearly by him. I accept that the family circumstances may induce a more obstinate frame of mind than any other circumstances in which people are indebted—though one must not assume that people will necessarily be less obstinate and deliberate in their refusal to pay debts when they feel that injustice has been done to them in circumstances other than in these particular circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has referred to his own experience. Many years ago a client whom I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
representing was ordered to pay maintenance to his wife. He was a man of some means, but he said that he would rather go to prison than pay and, to my amazement, he did. His wife did not get her maintenance, but I do not think that made a great deal of difference to either of them in that case. There are cases of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that nobody would suggest that the mere inability to pay should be a ground for sending people to prison. In many cases, it is difficult to judge whether there is a genuine mere inability or whether there is some form of deliberate abstention from obtaining work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at this question in a broad way, the reality of the matter is that, if one is a person with reasonable means, there are many ways in which those means can be attached, and the court has ample powers to attach the means of a person who has the means to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here dealing with a limited class of people who may possibly have no means that can be attached or have no job from which earnings can be attached, but who nonetheless the court feels could produce the money if they made a greater effort to do so, perhaps by obtaining employment. Where there is employment or where there are means, this remedy is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person is so determined not to pay, whether it be a maintenance debt some other debt about which, rightly or wrongly, he feels very strongly that injustice is being done, and who is so determined that he will deprive himself of an opportunity to work and earn money in order to prevent himself from obtaining the ability to pay the maintenance, I really wonder whether the possibility of going to prison will be any more of a deterrent to him or an inducement to go to work and to pay than it was for my client in the particular case to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see what basis, other than the kind of sentimental basis—and I do not use that word in any deprecatory sense, the kind of feeling that perhaps we all have when thinking of maintaning a wife or family—may have led the Committee to take a different view and may, for all I know, have led my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) to take a different view. It seems to be only that rather than a sensible and logical approach to the matter, that allows this particular exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly fair for my hon. Friend to have taken the view that it was finely balanced, to have come down one side of the line four years ago but to come down on the other side of the line today. That is no more peculiar than the answer that the Minister gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) in the last debate when he said that it was a finely balanced matter and that he would like to think again about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all I know, the hon. and learned Gentleman may have come here thinking that he would not accept the new clause. For all I know, and it would not surprise me, my hon. Friend's arguments which are always persuasive made him feel that there was something more to be thought about. So it does not become the Minister to tease my hon. Friend about what she may have said a few years ago. I hope that when the Minister gives us the benefit of his final report on this matter he will adopt the same open mind that he adopted in relation to the previous new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been in the somewhat intractable difficulty of my hon. Friend, in that I have had to answer as a Minister on this issue and then talk about it afterwards. It is a most difficult position. We are always given the same old dusty brief which we all read as Ministers, and sometimes it looks different in Opposition. I never found it easy to read the Departmental brief, and I always longed to read this particular brief in a different kind of way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was strongly in favour of the Finer committee report but that report was sabotaged by the Treasury on the issue of resources. If it had been implemented we could have abolished imprisonment for maintenance default, but until we reach that stage, the argument that has convinced me that we must stick with imprisonment as a final sanction is as follows. When one examines the figures of those who were threatened with imprisonment and what happened to them when they were threatened, the results always indicated that they were willing to pay up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to see a criminal sanction used as an enforcement for a civil debt. I want to get rid of that, as Mr. Justice Payne wanted to do. Th truth of the matter is that no Government have yet had the guts to insist that the Inland Revenue should collect fines for civil debt by means of the Inland Revenue system. If they did that we could get over this problem, but we have never been able to persuade the Treasury to do that. Until we do that, what is left to the person who has got a judgment debt of this kind—the only judgment debt enforceable by imprisonment—apart from imprisonment? We must recognise that in some cases the person is holding out until the very last moment and then pays up. The figures prove that. Like my hon. Friend, I cannot understand how anybody would risk going to prison, if he had the resources to pay, but in fact people do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has now said twice that the figures show that those who are threatened with imprisonment actually pay up. I am interested in those figures. Can he tell us what they are? The figures that I have suggest the opposite, that the majority of maintenance defaulters—about 80 per cent, of them—do not pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where my hon. Friend gets his figures, but I suspect that he gets them from the same source that I do. He keeps on telling us that he gets them from the Home Office in replies to parliamentary questions. I do not have the figures to hand at the moment, but I am sure that the Minister will be willing to provide them. Unless things have changed in the last five years—and I should be happy to hear that that is so—the figures that prior to that indicated quite clearly that within 24 hours of an imprisonment order being made a substantial proportion of those who had a maintenance debt paid up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friends, I wanted to get rid of imprisonment as a sanction for non-payment of maintenance. I would have done it at the time if it had not been for the figures. But granted that there is no other alternative until the Treasury is willing to play, I do not see how we can get out of this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on the fact that the alternatives, which we cannot at present adopt, appear to amend the Attachement of Earnings Act 1971 to make it more effective and applicable to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
everybody, however they earn? I am told that there are other methods of recovering civil debts. I cannot define all of these, but there are distress warrants, interim orders, charging orders, a writ of sequestration, and a garnishee order. Some hon. Members will know what all these are. They are alternative methods of recovering civil debts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spent 15 years at the Bar waiting for the time when I could get a garnishee order. I always wanted to have a garnishee order from the moment when I first heard the name. It is such a lovely resonant name. I never managed to achieve it, because I never managed to find an appropriate occasion when somebody was owed a debt by somebody else and Icould get him there and shove a garnishee order on him. That is not to say that they are not used. They are used, as are the other orders, mainly in cases where somebody has property. The real difficulty about maintenance orders is that people frequently do not have property. The only thing that they have is an income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real difficulty about this whole area, as we all know, is that most people cannot afford to have two wives, and cannot afford, out of their income, to maintain two households. Therefore, they constantly have this problem, but they want to go on earning, hence they have some resources. If the court has made an order, that must normally be enforced. Whether it is right that we should go on making orders in relation to the first wife when the second wife also has to be maintained is a matter for current debate but as long as the order exists it has to be enforced, and the real question is how we enforce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax. I think that we ought to improve the attachment of earnings orders and the procedures, but even that is difficult if somebody has one of those husbands—unfortunately there are many—who keep changing their jobs. It is not that they do not get a job, but they keep changing it and moving around the country. The only way we can get round that is through the Inland Revenue, but it will not play ball. That was always our difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real advance will come when we get the Inland Revenue on to a computer. We have been talking of that for about 10 years, and almost everything else seems to stem from getting the Inland Revenue on to computer recording. If we did that, it would be much easier to do many other things in the social sphere, not least of which would be to keep a record of where the fellow is getting income. I am entirely with my hon. Friend. I want to get rid of this as quickly as possible, and every criminal penologist wants to get rid of it as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the real problem is those husbands who keep changing their jobs and moving from one part of the country to another. I take it that he means that they are doing that deliberately in order to avoid payment of maintenance. Is that kind of person really likely to be deterred by the possibility of imprisonment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can ask the same question, with the same bated breath as my right hon. and learned Friend, and I did so at the time. I remember asking officials in the Home Office exactly the same question, and they used to come up with those statistics which my right hon. and learned Friend says that they have not got. That suggests clearly that a considerable proportion—as I recollect, a majority—used to pay up within 24 hours of receiving an imprisonment order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to talk about statistics which none of us have in front of us, but surely that may well be true in the case of many people who are reluctant to pay maintenance, against whom other methods are available, and there ought to be available still further methods. I query whether it is true in relation to the sort of person who would go to the length of doing what my hon. Friend the Member for York was suggesting—I am sure that it does happen—and whom he said were the real problem. They disappear and get jobs in another part of the country simply to avoid paying maintenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend may have nailed my hyperbole. When I said "the real problem" I was talking about a particular kind of problem. What the proportion of the total is, I am not able to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of what I said is simply the result of hard experience. I regret it as much as my hon. Friends, but given the hard experience I do not see how we can, at the moment, change it unless we are prepared to change something more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about statistics but there is no need to go into the recesses of the Home Office to find them. One only has to talk to the local clerk to the justices and ask him or her how many times this has to be used in order to get people to pay up. The answers will be quite overwhelming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak only briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). Like the Minister, I well remember when my hon. Friend, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson), defended the imprisonment of maintenance defaulters. Like my hon. Friends, I welcome her conversion to the argument that they should no longer be imprisoned. I have no doubt that she will take that conversion with her into Government next time and we will see the ending of imprisonment of maintenance defaulters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we may wish to ensure that maintenance is paid, and all of us presumably share that view, it is felt and argued—no doubt the Minister will attempt to support it by statistics—that many maintenance defaulters can only be compelled to pay if the ultimate sanction of imprisonment is hanging over their heads. The majority of those who are in prison serve more than 80 per cent, of their sentences, which in their case clearly does not mean that they are actually paying the maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister, in reply to this debate, will use the figures that my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) remembers but cannot recall—the figures used in evidence to the Home Office Select Committee when it inquired into reports on the courts and which were then very clearly discredited. The figures were acknowledged to be so discredited by the Home Office officials who advanced them in support of the contention that we should still continue to have the option of imprisoning maintenance defaulters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They showed that 90 per cent, of those whom committal warrants were served actually paid up. What that 90 per cent, figure masked was the fact that only a very small sample of individuals had been surveyed. That was more than 10 years ago, the circumstances were very different then, and the whole exercise on which the Home
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
Office has constantly relied since then to support its arguments, was an unrepresentative, untypical and unscientific application of survey technique. My hon. Friend the Member for York perhaps now remembers what was accepted by Home Office officials when giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend. It is my recollection—and my hon. Friend has me at a disadvantage because I have not brought the figures—that there was not one particular sample but a continuing survey of the figures over a period of years, he says the survey has been totally discredited. I always have to bow to my hon. Friend's wisdom, but L do not know by whom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend does not have to bow to my wisdom or to anything else. All he has to do is to look at the evidence that was given to us and to other members of the Home Affairs Select Committee. The argument—by which he was persuaded, as I was at one time—that 90 per cent, pay once a committal warranty is served, is very persuasive. Before the Home Office officials came to give evidence on the Finer and Payne reports to the Select Committee, I actually inquired where they obtained this evidence from and I took some trouble to ascertain the kind of survey they undertook. When I looked at it I found, as Home Office officials conceded at that Committee, that the figures were unrepresentative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the point is not an argument about statistics. We all wish maintenance payments to be made. However, we do not want maintenance defaulters to be imprisoned. They are not dangerous. They are not a threat to the public. We wish them to be imprisoned only if it brings about the payment of their arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more sensible method would be that advocated by the Payne and Finer Committees and, more recently, by the Select Committee on Home Affairs—namely, to have more effective enforcement machinery. Both the Labour Government and the present Government have been extremely dilatory—the Labour Government in responding to the Payne report and this Government implementing the recommendations of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. We need to ensure that defaulters who may run up large arrears are identified at an early stage and that there is some machinery to ensure that the maintenance is paid. We need the enforcement office recommended by the Payne Committee and also the suggested alternative methods. We should not rely constantly upon the recurring threat of imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the option of imprisonment is taken away from the Government and the courts, we shall never achieve a Government who are willing to put sufficient energy and resources into the establishment of an enforcement office and machinery. For that reason alone, and simply by closing that road, we may force the Government to adopt a more sensible posture and provide the necessary resources. If the Minister gives an unsatisfactory reply, I hope that that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax will press the matter to a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting debate on an important topic. However, we have tended to remain silent about the fact that it is important not least to the beneficiaries of maintenance orders. That is what it is all
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
about. Some may say that this is simply another judgment debt. The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) made that point. It is more than an ordinary civil debt—it derives from a continuing obligation imposed by Parliament to support one's wife or child. That puts it in a distinct category. It distinguishes if from the debt that arises where, for example, I may have contracted with you, Mr. Watkins, to pay you some money and then failed to meet that obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where Parliament has imposed an obligation for a man to support his wife, it must think long before it closes a means by which the wife can bring pressure upon a recalcitrant husband to do what Parliament has said he should do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For my benefit, if not for those of the legal profession, will the hon. and learned Gentleman quote the legislation in which Parliament provides that a man must support his wife?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is inherent in the whole of our matrimonial law that there is an obligation to support one's wife. It is the basis of all maintenance orders. That is fairly elementary. Maintenance orders are sometimes made by agreement, but they derive from the obligation that Parliament has imposed. That principle applies similarly to children.

We must determine whether there is any value in the power to imprison. It is certainly common ground across the Committee that nobody should be imprisoned unless some good will come from it. I believe that good does come from the power to imprison, although I quite agree that no good comes to the wife from actual imprisonment if that imprisonment lasts more than a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) about his client who, greatly to his surprise, was prepared to go to prison and to stay there. That, of course, does not result in any money being paid to the wife. However, simply because the husband has served the statutory maximum, which is six weeks' imprisonment, for default, does not absolve him from his obligation. He cannot be sent to prison again for that default, but the civil debt remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) that there is substantial evidence that the threat to imprison is valuable. It is true that, to my knowledge, only one survey has been carried out. That was not 10 years ago, as the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) suggested, but eight years ago. It covered only a very small sample. It was undertaken by the Home Office in 1974 in six magistrates' courts. The results showed that in almost 90 per cent, of the cases in which a suspended committal warrant was issued the defaulter did not go to prison. The survey did not show why the warrants were not issued, but it is fair to assume that in the great majority of cases it was because the defaulter paid up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead about his experience in the courts and what has been said to him by those who operate there—those whose experiences and virtues were explained half an hour ago by the hon. Member for Ormskirk, namely, the justices' clerks and the magistrates. It demonstrates the deterrent effect of the suspended committal warrant, but it does not show how many others

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman acknowledged that the survey was carried out a long time ago. I thought that it was 10 years ago, but perhaps it was eight years ago. It was a small sample of only six magistrates' courts. Was it also a small sample of maintenance defaulters? How many were sampled to produce the 90 per cent, figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not found any reason to show that the picture was either unrepresentative or may have changed. The fact that the numbers of persons committed to prison for maintenance default remains stable year after year points to the continuing validity of the survey's findings. The hon. Member for Ormskirk and other Opposition Members have not lacked back-up in the form of briefs. Nor have the various valuable organisations that concern themselves with these matters been backward in carrying out surveys and undertaking research. If there were statistical or survey evidence to suggest that the power to imprison had no influence upon the ability of wives to enforce their maintenance orders, I suspect that we would have heard of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wishes to use those figures, he must allow us to draw the right deductions from them. As I understand the Minister, 90 per cent, of those under suspended sentence paid up. I suppose the other 10 per cent, did not. That means that one in 10 of the sample felt so strongly that even with the threat of imprisonment they would not pay. We must decide whether, in relation to the other 90 per cent., there could not be other equally effective methods of persuading them to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder what those methods could be. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead has told us of experiences—all Members of Parliament dealing with constituents have had similar experiences—of wives up against the intractable husband who will not pay. In the end, if pressure can be brought to bear through the threat of imprisonment, we should think very hard before we abandon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the suggestion of the Expenditure Committee about, the extension of community service orders? Prison need not be the only encouragement to make a man pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right—the fifteenth report of the Expenditure Committee made that recommendation. In their response, the Government expressed serious reservations about the recommendation on the grounds that it would require substantial expansion of probation service resources and that the suitability of maintenance and fine defaulters as candidates for the scheme was doubtful. Our comments on the recommendation were couched in terms of the fine defaulter, but the same considerations would apply to the maintenance defaulter. Those are, first, that the scheme depends for its success on the consent of the participant and his active co-operation over a period. It is doubtful, therefore, whether those who have wilfully refused or culpably neglected to pay would be suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if the defaulters cut short the period of their service by repaying their outstanding debt, or part of it, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
community service schemes might be disrupted and the good will of the community forfeited as tasks were left uncompleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, a community service order is likely to be imposed in cases where the threat of imprisonment would otherwise be enough to achieve payment. A defaulter who is not persuaded to pay by the threat of imprisonment will not regard community service as an incentive to do so. Moreover, some form of effective sanction against breach of a community service order by the maintenance defaulter would need to be devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not twit the hon. Lady more than a little—she will not mind that—for having taken the view that she did when she had responsibility for these matters. Of course, one can change one's mind. All I am saying is that Lord Butler's trenchant remarks were uttered about 15 years before the hon. Lady made her speech with such force. She made it appear in her advocacy today that it was an open and shut case. I felt it right to draw her attention to the contrary view that she had expressed. But I will say no more about it because the dusting down that has taken place from both sides of the Committee has, I think, tended to embarrass the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must decide at the end of the day whether evidence known to us—if I may use that terrible word "anecdotal", by which I mean the evidence that is suggested by common sense and by our own experience as Members of Parliament plus the evidence, such as it is, of the survey to which I have referred—should be disregarded. Should we say to the unfortunate women who are victimised by husbands who refuse to obey the order of the court until it is backed up with a warrant of committal that, because we want to avoid committing people to prison, we shall refuse that sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total prison population at any time includes only about 1,000 fine defaulters. Those in prison for failing to pay fines imposed for drunkenness number only about 60 or 70 at any one time. There are about 2,500 receptions for fine default for drunkenness in any one year. The fact that only 60 to 70 are in prison at any one time suggests that, once they are committed, they take steps to pay their fines very quickly. About 200 to 300 people are in prison each year as a result of not paying maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although I have listened carefully to the arguments, I cannot advise the Committee to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My figure is that in 1979, 2,452 people were received into prison for non-payment of maintenance or for arrears under an affiliation order. In view of the crisis in the prison population, that group of offenders should be seriously considered by the Government together with all the other groups of offenders whom they consider should not receive custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not embarrassed because I now take a different view, after considerable reflection and continued assessment of the problem. I should like to think that the Minister's mind is not permanently closed on every subject on which he has uttered in the Committee. Often he has said that it is a matter of balance and that he will think about a certain matter. I certainly would not mock, scorn and humiliate him if he were to change his view.

I am glad that I have received such impressive support from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin)—as I usually do—and also from other hon. Friends who are aware of many ways in which

	<div class='title'>CAUTIONING OF OFFENDERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>'In every case where a person has not committed any similar offence before, he should not be charged with an offence which he admits until the police have considered cautioning him for the offence.'.—	<i>[Mr. Alexander W. Lyon.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system of cautioning is not sanctioned by any statutory backing, but is used widely throughout the police force to deal with people who have admitted their offences and either have not been in trouble before or are such unusual offenders that the police think it appropriate to administer a formal caution. The procedure has been built up to allow that caution to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has always concerned me is that cautioning is widely used in the case of children, but nothing like so widely in the case of adults. Yet it has always seemed to me appropriate to divert from the criminal prosecution system those who are not grave or serious offenders but have simply stumbled into crime on one or two occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the clause as a basis of trying to press for a wider application of cautioning for adult offenders, or at least offenders over the age of 17. The figures for 1980 show that of 2V2 million offences, the number of offenders dealt with in that way was 107,000 males and 38,000 females. That represented 12 per cent, of all ages of male offenders and 23 per cent, of all ages of women offenders. Only four per cent, of male offenders and 12 per cent, of female offenders, however, were over 17. It is thus quite clear that the vast majority of police forces regard cautioning as a sanction that they can use for children but not adults—other than in motoring offences, where it is done on a much more informal basis and is not counted within the statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of cases where a formal caution is all that is required. In the case of middle-aged respectable shoplifters, it would be perfectly possible, if the person were to admit the offence, to administer a formal caution by a superintendant. That person would probably never
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
come before a court. There is no reason why they should be dragged before the courts and humiliated, given the possibility of recurrence of that kind of offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it fascinating to look through the areas where cautioning is given in existing circumstances, which, as I said, is heavily weighted on younger offenders. A considerable proportion of those offences involve violence. It is clear that even on occasions of violence with children under the age of 17, the police often feel that it is not necessary to proceed further than a formal caution. If that is true of young offenders, it may be true also of older offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the absurdities of the present row about criminal statistics, and in particular the row about statistics on violence, is that violence, just like rape, is capable of an infinite variety of circumstances—with rape perhaps less so than assault. If somebody pushes against a man in a pub deliberately, it constitutes an assault, but nobody could conceive that that was a very serious offence. In most cases it is not even reported. If it amounted to a little more than that it might be reported, but it should go to court if it is committed by a man who is of good character, has never been in trouble before, and does not look as though he will get into trouble again. In those circumstances, even in the case of violence, it should be possible to caution. It would certainly make a vast difference to the criminal court system if we could use cautioning much more extensively with adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that it can be done. Some part of the total number of offenders over the age of 21 are dealt with in that way. In 1980, 19,600 men over 21 were so dealt with, and the number of offenders cautioned for indictable offences was 1,000 for violence against the person, 500 for sexual offences, 100 for burglary, 3,900 for robbery, 200 for theft, 100 for criminal damage, and 700 for other offences. Clearly, that practice is used in a very wide variety of cases. However, it is not used widely enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that the wording is perfect, but if we could include something similar to the new clause in the Bill, it might stimulate the police to consider cautioning on a wider plane. I have no statistics to back me, but my instinct is that the police are reluctant to caution adults in case they are accused of favouring one person rather than another, which might lead to some backlash from public opinion—which accepts it in relation to children. If that is so, we have an important part to play in moulding public opinion, and thereby opinion in the police force, to the view that cautioning is a perfectly acceptable way of dealing with a criminal who admits his guilt if that is the only, or nearly the only, offence that he has committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I hope that the Committee will back the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support my hon. Friend and his new clause. As he rightly said, most cautions are given to young offenders, especially juveniles, rather than to adults. I want to relate my brief remarks to the young and juvenile offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their White Paper "Young Offenders", published in 1980, the Government acknowledged that all the available evidence suggested that if a young person or juvenile was diverted early enough from the criminal justice system, he did not come back to that system. Indeed, the Black Committee's report published in 1979 on legislation and services for children in Northern Ireland went still further
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
and pointed to the stigmatising effect of a court appearance, indicating that for many young people and juveniles an appearance in court helped to stereotype them as a juvenile delinquent and a criminal, and that, on many occasions, it actually confirmed them in their criminal propensities and criminal careers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) mentioned some of the figures that show that there has been an increase in the use of cautioning in the past 10 or 20 years. Indeed, there has also been evidence of the success rate of cautioning. Figures provided by the Metropolitan Police suggest that only 20 per cent, of juveniles cautioned for a first-time offence commit further offences. On that evidence—and there is other available evidence—it appears to be a sensible way both of diverting, one hopes permanently, juveniles and young people away from the criminal justice system and of stopping them re-offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that there is enormous variation in cautioning practice from one police authority area to another. Indeed, the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, in its 1981 report, pointed out the inconsistencies in the policies and practice in relation to cautioning of many of the police force areas. It acknowledged that the variation may have something to do with different circumstances in the different areas, but nevertheless argued, as have many other individuals and organisations, that there should be greater consistency in the cautioning practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Commission wanted the formal caution procedure to be sanctioned in legislation. The parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group in its report "Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future" endorsed that sentiment and made a similar recommendation in paragraph 25 arguing that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use of the caution should be sanctioned in legislation and attention should be given to achieving greater consistency throughout the country."</p></blockquote>
The Committee was also concerned about the examination of cautioning practice, even in areas which have a relatively high cautioning rate such as Essex. A study published in 1979 by researchers of Lancaster university found that of 131 young offenders appearing before the juvenile court in Basildon, 58 per cent, had never been cautioned. That is rather surprising and a cause for concern, especially as Essex is always cited as one of those areas that have a liberal, sensible, radical and imaginative approach to young offenders and generally use the caution fairly extensively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research study by Lancaster university, entitled "Punishment and Welfare", also pointed out that those figures raised serious and important questions about the extent to which cautioning was being used as a diversionary mechanism and about the criteria that the police use in considering a child for a caution. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If over 50 per cent, of children appearing before the court do so without ever having been cautioned, then it seems clear that it is not being used as it was originally intended, i.e. to deal with children's first offences in a less formal and stigmatising manner."</p></blockquote>
Twenty of the cases to which I have referred—16 per cent.—resulted in absolute or conditional discharges, which suggests that those cases, or certainly a considerable number of them, need not have been brought before the courts. They would have been right and proper cases for the administering of a caution. Similarly, in the authors' analysis of young offenders given care orders in Rochdale,
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
just over half had been prosecuted rather than cautioned for their first offence and 75 per cent, had been prosecuted for their second offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its consideration of the cautioning system, the Committee was very much attracted by the Black Committee's proposal that all first or second minor offenders who admit guilt should be cautioned by the police, and that only cases that posed a real or serious threat to society should go before the juvenile court. The Committee made recommendations accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the evidence suggests that cautioning is not always used as an alternative to prosecution, but is sometimes used for young offenders who would otherwise not have been prosecuted. I hope that the Minister, in replying to the debate, will address some of his remarks to that development, because clearly the cautioning system was never intended to be used in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the evidence, as the Minister is no doubt aware, is contained in the Home Office Research Study No. 37, "Police Cautioning in England and Wales", published in 1976. Some was provided by the police. Writing in "Justice of the Peace" on 10 May 1980, Detective Chief Inspector Donald Taylor of the Avon and Somerset constabulary argued that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A formal recorded caution is not appropriate in such cases. Strong advice may be expedient and indeed sensible, but in order that the recipients are not left with a sense of injustice, such cautions should not be a matter of record."</p></blockquote>
The practice of which I have recently learnt, and which has disturbed several juvenile magistrates—that of quoting in court a juvenile antecedent history of cautioning which is therefore used against him—lends strength to this argument. If an offender, especially a juvenile, could not be prosecuted for an offence, he should not be given a formal caution because it may appear as part of his record in any subsequent court appearance. That practice is wrong and indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In more than one of its reports, the Committee has pointed out that, in comparison with the figures for juveniles, the proportion of adult offenders cautioned is very low—the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for York. For example, in 1980, 3 per cent, of males aged 17 and over were cautioned for indictable offences—compared with 34 per cent, of those aged 14 to 16—and 9 per cent, of females aged 17 and over were cautioned, compared with 58 per cent, of those aged 14 to 16. Therefore, the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group recommended that cautioning should be used more often in appropriate cases for adult offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary has promised to consider our recommendations on cautioning in the course of his consideration of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure. I hope that the Government will be able to accept as soon as possible the recommendations of the Royal Commission, that cautioning should be made more consistent and put on a statutory basis. I hope that they will then be able to give legislative backing to what I and my hon. Friend the Member for York believe to be an extremely valuable method of dealing not just with young offenders and juveniles but with adult offenders as well, in a manner which would help to divert them permanently away from the criminal justice and penal system. Quite clearly, any measure which has some chance of achieving that objective is to be welcomed and supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Pitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the new clause moved by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) and the remarks made by the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk). I am particularly moved to speak by the references made by the hon. Member for York to shoplifting. Many of us have still in our minds the tragic case of Lady Barnett who, sadly, died soon after committing an offence of shoplifting. I do not think the new clause would cater for the professionals who regularly pillage our large stores throughout the year. I believe that in London at any rate the Metropolitan Police are carrying out very effective action against these people. But almost weekly in our local papers we read of cases where people have stolen from shops for no apparent reason. These people live in fear of the publicity generated, the pillorying that they will suffer in their local community, because there is no effective measure at the moment to divert them from their course, and to prevent them from carrying out such acts again, save taking them before the magistrate and making them face that terrifying experience which none of them would normally have faced before, especially people who have reached a position of some prominence in their community. Often, in the case of petty pilfering carried out by people in middle life, these people need treatment and sympathy rather than formal sanction. Being arraigned before the court, being sentenced, even being bound over, is not an effective way of dealing with these people who may have committed crimes in fact but not in deed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ryman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that theft is not a crime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that theft is not a crime. Far from it. As a recent victim of a burglary myself I certainly would not say that. I said that these were crimes in fact, but I do not think they call for the sanctions that would be applied to the normal thief, or to the systematic shoplifter. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the proposals in the new clause are the kind of sanctions that could be applied to the unfortunate people who carry out thefts for reasons which are often inexplicable. I think that such people need effective treatment and sympathy rather than the sanctions of being arraigned before the courts and being given some form of sentence, even a binding over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a course gives store detectives considerable powers to ruin a person's otherwise blameless life. I am not in any way decrying store detectives, but these people are able to hold a sanction over people who may well have stolen something for reasons which they themselves cannot explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I wish to support the new clause. If it is used properly, bearing in mind the statistics that the hon. Member for Ormskirk has detailed and the remarks of the hon. Member for York, it would be an effective way of deterring people and it would take them away from the formal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have already heard, people diverted from the formal system often do not return if their offences are of such a nature that they occur within the compass of what I have said. I ask the Committee unanimously to support the new clause, because it would be a very effective method of treating such persons as I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would oblige the police to consider administering a formal caution to a self-confessed offender as an alternative to prosecuting him if he had not committed a similar offence before. Plainly, the reasoning behind it is that the use of the formal caution should be developed and that it should be regarded as potentially appropriate for first offenders of all kinds and of all ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) frankly and fairly said that he had tabled the new clause in order to provide a means of discussing the institution of the caution, and I am grateful to him for having done so. I do not think that he contends that the wording of the new clause could render it suitable for inclusion in the Bill, and I do not propose to criticise it on technical grounds, save perhaps to say that it cannot be realistic to impose a statutory duty to go through this process in a case where, for example, it is clear from the very start, by reason of the gravity of the offence, that a caution cannot be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dissent from what has been said generally about the virtues of the cautioning system, and I take note of the fact that it is to a great degree limited—or so it appears—to juvenile offenders in its application, though not, of course, in its availability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party Penal Affairs Group recommended in its report "Too Many Prisoners" that the use of police caution in relation to adults should be extended and it claimed that the cautioning rate—the proportion of adult males cautioned by the police as a percentage of those found guilty of or cautioned for indictable offences—fell from 4 per cent, in 1974 to 3 per cent, in 1978. This does not, however, show that the rate is in the process of declining now, and the figures for 1979 and 1980 are also 3 per cent. Taking the country as a whole, the rate has remained stable for adult males for many years, standing at either 3 or 4 per cent, in every year since 1958. As far as young offenders are concerned, however, the rate has increased sizeably over recent years, although it now appears to be stabilising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office has so far issued no guidance to the police about the cautioning of adults, but police forces are understood to apply the same criteria—that is, the evidence available must be sufficient to support a prosecution, the offender must have admitted the offence and the offender and his parents or guardian, in the case of a juvenile, must have agreed to the administration of a caution. If these criteria are satisfied, the decision whether or not to caution turns on the circumstances of the offender, the nature of the offence and the attitude of the victim or the aggrieved person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having drawn attention to the fact that technical matters certainly prevent the inclusion of the new clause, I should like to say that the formal caution has a significant part to play in the operation of the criminal justice system, particularly as far as young offenders are concerned. It can be of substantial benefit. It allows the police, when dealing with someone who admits an offence, and taking into account all the relevant circumstances, to give the offender a formal warning and an opportunity to change, to go straight, without having recourse to criminal proceedings, which may have consequences out of all proportion to the offence for the offender, his family and his future. We have all come across cases, either at first hand or through
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
reading about them, where that has been the case. The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, whose report this House debated on 20 November, noted the considerable variation in the use made of the formal caution by different police forces, and recommended that it should be placed on a more consistent basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not entirely a straightforward matter. As the Commission observed, at least some of these variations can be explained in terms of the different characteristics of the areas concerned. The use made of the caution, furthermore, cannot be considered in isolation from the differential use made of the charge and summons procedures for bringing offenders before a court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can, however, tell the Committee that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary fully accepts that the scope for reducing these variations as far as possible should be fully explored. Where one has an institution or course of practice that is shown to be valuable, but which can also be shown to be very variably applied, it is desirable that from the centre such guidance as can be given should be given to help develop a standard course of practice so far as is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office is, therefore, discussing this matter now with the Association of Chief Police Officers. The most sensible way to leave this, I suggest, is to allow us to wait and see how we get on with the Association of Chief Police Officers in our discussions, having regard to the general policy that I have indicated that the Home Secretary wishes to follow. I hope, therefore, that it may be enough for us to leave the matter at present on that basis, and in that case it may be possible for the hon. Member for York to withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With that assurance I am happy to withdraw.

I hope that if, in due course, ACPO agrees that a more sensible system of adult cautioning is possible, it might be done in the form of advice in a formal way from the local police, so that those outside the police force may see on what basis cautioning is available.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a small but significant new clause. Prison sentences are customarily expressed in years or in months, and not often days. This means that a sentence of a month or months is of variable duration according to the time of year it is passed. It starts from the month in which it takes effect, plus any subsequent months, so that a defendant sentenced to one month in February would serve 28 days, or 29 in a leap year, a defendant sentenced in April, June, September or November would serve 30 days, and in any other of the seven months if he was sentenced he would serve 31 days. A day in prison is an important factor in somebody's life, and there are also the financial and overcrowding aspects to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfair, in that sentences are, in practice, of variable length under the present system. Offenders would then know more precisely the period for which they were committed to prison, if it was in days. Apparently people working in the prison system, and people working with offenders, welcome this change. It would be easier when calculating the proportion of the sentence to be served or suspended when considering a partially suspended sentence, if it were in days and not months, finally, it would help courts to think in terms of multiples of 10 days, rather than months. Perhaps this would encourage courts to pass shorter sentences of imprisonment. A sentence of 50 days is likely to be just as effective as one of two months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the evidence is that a long sentence is no more of a deterrent than a shorter sentence. A sentence of 100 days is likely to be just as effective as one of four months. For all these reasons it would be preferable, when a court is passing a sentence of imprisonment, to put it in days. I hope that this small new clause can be accepted by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say only that I endorse completely the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax. I think it was the Barbara Wootton committee which first proposed imprisonment by days. I certainly would prefer us to imprison on the basis of days rather than of months. I certainly support her view that that should be done. I would extend the whole concept to fines, but that would be outside the terms of this new clause. I hope that on Report we might consider a day fine as an alternative to the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) for having tabled this new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
clause. It is certainly a matter of interest and one that deserves discussion. I certainly support the objectives that she seeks to serve by putting the new clause into the Bill. The possible advantages in the proposal that the courts should express sentences in terms of days rather than months are, I think, widely acknowledged. Certainly the Magistrates' Association, which has been in favour of this idea, is aware of our view that sentences expressed in days can provide a finer sentencing tool, and in so far as that approach may lend itself to shorter sentences there are cases in which that is to be welcomed. But that does not mean, I believe, that we ought to legislate to require the courts to adopt that approach. There are difficulties in such a requirement which oblige me to advise the Committee not to accept the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, in any case, no guarantee that sentencing in days would result in shorter sentences. It may well be that a court, deprived of a sentence in months, may employ units amounting to a longer sentence. If one looks at the limit, for example, of magistrates' sentencing powers, which we all know are presently six months for a single offence, the equivalent provision of 180 days does not immediately impinge on the mind as a logical sentence. I think that many courts might say they have got to sentence in days. The hon. Lady suggested multiples of 10. One does not immediately think of the 18 multiple of 10. One might well find a court imposing 200 days. There the provision would work in the opposite direction to that intended by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads to the supposition that the courts would not necessarily use the new currency—if one can use that term—according to its value formerly expressed in months. One hundred days might become a common sentence replacing three months. In the Crown court, 300 days instead of nine months might become the norm. No one can predict what sentencing pattern would emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new clause is intended to induce shorter custodial terms, as in part the hon. Lady says it is, that is an act of faith rather than a consequence of certainty on which much reliance should not, I think, be placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an objection of principle. While the proposal may remove the vagaries in the calendar for sentences up to and including a year, it would create anomalies between those sentences and sentences longer than a year, and an offender sentenced to, say, 18 months' imprisonment for a single offence would be liable to serve about a week longer than someone sentenced to three consecutive sentences of three months for three separate offences. The solution to that kind of anomaly would be the contrived one of establishing a standard year of 360 days which is not instantly attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured that all these calculations are correct. I am afraid they absolutely blind my mind and I am simply passing on what I am assured is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inequality of calendar months is not the only factor which may produce unequal terms of imprisonment. The practice of releasing prisoners on the nearest preceding weekday when discharge is due at the weekend or an a bank holiday also results in prisoners with identical sentences, however expressed, serving different periods. It is, therefore, impracticable to secure absolute equality of time served for the same sentence, which is another of
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
the objectives that the hon. Lady wants to achieve. The effect of remission, however, serves to reduce the anomaly caused by unequal calendar months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory conversion of months to days for sentencing purposes along the lines of this new clause does not provide a guarantee that shorter sentences would result. It contains the possibility of the reverse happening, it creates anomalies between sentences of one year or less and sentences in excess of one year, and it cannot secure absolute equality of treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to be so extremely dampening upon a new clause, the purpose of which we should all like to see achieved, but I am afraid that these calculations and arguments are correct. Therefore, it is for these reasons that I feel obliged to advise the Committee not to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause was much discussed recently in the press and described as the "curfew clause". I believe that this new clause will be of significant benefit to the courts if it finds its way on to the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may briefly outline its powers, its objectives, its place within the framework of the Bill, the way in which it might be enforced and, most important of all, where it originates, and finally the question of enforceability and one or two matters of detail. I shall then have outlined what the new clause stands for and why I think that it should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause will, quite simply, grant to the court the power, in cases where offenders aged between 10 and 20 come before it and including cases where they are accompanied by the parent, guardian or other authority with whom the child or young person resides, to order the young offender to remain at home or at the place where he normally resides at any time after six o'clock on a weekday until six o'clock the following morning or at any
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
time from noon onwards until six o'clock the following morning on a Saturday or Sunday. That is the broad ambit of the power, but it is a flexible power and I shall return to that flexibility in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the new clause is highly relevant in the context of the Bill as a whole. This important Bill has among its objects that of emphasising and reinforcing the responsibility of parents and of giving to the courts as wide a range of penalties as possible, from which they can select the penalty most appropriate both to the offence and to the offender. The option of ordering a curfew on a young person or child would provide a valuable additional power from which the courts could select in appropriate cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the new clause is to involve the parent and to reinforce parental authority in those cases in which the parent is willing to accept that responsibility and to seek to enforce it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has said on a couple of occasions that the aim is to reinforce parental authority. Does he not think that some in the age range covered by the new clause—people of 18, 19 or 20—are a little too old to come within the scope of parental authority as he defines it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They could be married offenders. Would a husband or wife be asked to consent to such an order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to those points when I have outlined the objects of the new clause in more detail. I am aware of them and there are sensible answers to them, which I shall outline in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object, as I have said, is to involve parents and to reinforce parental authority, but at the same time to provide the courts with a punishment which marks the disapproval of society in a way which is well understood, particularly in respect of children and young people, by keeping the offender at home at a time when he or she might like to be out. At the same time, it will help to restrain an offender, in circumstances in which the parent or guardian is ready to co-operate, at times of the evening or weekends when they are known to have been out and about and getting into trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The origins of the new clause are formidable. Indeed, it has an excellent provenance. It originated, so far as I know, in a resolution of the Hertfordshire magistrates. I say this as a Member of Parliament for a constituency within Hertfordshire. At very much the same time as they were passing a resolution to send to the Magistrates' Association, the same idea was put forward for serious consideration by no less a person than the Lord Chief Justice of England in a speech to probation officers. It received the support of the Hertfordshire Magistrates' Association and of a resolution of the full Magistrates' Association last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from the documents which we have all received that, in principle, it has the support of the Inner London Juvenile Court Panel. I was glad to hear today that, in principle, at least for offenders up to the age of 17, it has the support of the Association of Directors of Social Services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the constructive and careful consideration which has been given to the new clause by other bodies which have followed our deliberations carefully. They have put forward a number of possibilities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
and problems. I shall not deal with them exhaustively in this opening speech, but I shall certainly refer to them because I take them seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to be able to tell the Committee that the new clause has that broad measure of goodwill from the courts and from the Association of Directors of Social Services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can also say that all the magistrates, chairmen of juvenile panels and chief and senior probation officers to whom I have spoken have seen a valuable use for the new clause, provided that it is properly used by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me back to the flexibility of the power which will be given to the courts. Some of the objections have arisen, I think, from those who see it being used in too blanket a form and who fail to remind themselves that in all the provisions which we make in the Bill we are giving the courts a wide discretion and a wide range of penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at any provision which provides a sentence of up to six months, three years or 14 years, one can always react by saying that 14 years is far too long. Equally, one could react to this curfew clause by saying that to keep a young person in for 42 days on end without a limit from 6pm every night and from noon every weekend would be an oppressive measure. But that is not to look at the new clause with the intelligence with which the courts would undoubtedly look at it, and with which I am sure the Committee would look at it. It gives the opportunity to pick, within those periods of the day and the weekends, the appropriate period for restraint and keeping at home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. and learned Friend comes to the more detailed points later in his speech will he also say a word about the way in which the courts might be able to inquire into the social and employment circumstances of the people in question, bearing in mind that an increasing number of people now, including married women, work shift work and unsocial hours, and that does not seem to ally itself very easily with this suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend and I am grateful to him for making that point. If the new clause is passed, it will be used or at least considered quite frequently by juvenile courts and in a significant number of cases though I would anticipate rather less fequently, for offenders aged 17 to 20 if the Committee thinks it right to include that age group. I think that is right, for reasons which I shall explain, and I shall try to deal with the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) and the hon. Member for Battersea South (Mr. Dubs).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering imposing a curfew order, the court would wish to look at the kind of offence that had been committed. For example, we know that many young people, indeed, not merely young people, go out at night and, come a certain hour, after a certain length of time perhaps in the public houses—and we know only too well that alcohol abuse is quite common even in those under the age of 18—they tend to get into trouble. They come to the notice of the police and find themselves brought before the courts for one form of offence or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that kind of case, where the parents would like the son or daughter to be at home or at least back by a reasonable hour, it might be throroughly sensible to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
a curfew order either for a period on certain nights of the week—say, Friday, Saturday and Sunday—when this sort of thing had been happening. One hopes that the young person might well have been working during the day, or even at night for a period of three or four weeks. When ordering that the young person should be back at home or stay at home after 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm, or even 10 pm, one would hope that the court would inquire into the social circumstances both of the offender and the parent—and this is where I take strongly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton—in deciding what would be the appropriate penalty and period of a curfew order in the individual case. Switching to the weekends, the court has the power, not the obligation, to keep a young person or child in on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This partly brings in the fact that the young person may have been getting into trouble at a football match or some other afternoon entertainment, and it may be appropriate to keep him away from it for two, three or more weekends, and partly the fact that by doing so, even for one weekend—though it may be appropriate in more serious cases to make it several weekends—one firmly marks the disapproval of the court for the offence which has been committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely important that the courts, in the case of young offenders who come before them, should have some powers which are not over severe—and I wish to emphasise this in the context of the whole band of penalties which we are providing within the Bill—but which show that the kind of behaviour which has caused the child or young person to be convicted is not to be tolerated and is to be visited with some punishment, with the consent of the parent. This is extremely important in the context of the whole philosophy of the Bill and, if I may presume to say so, in the whole philosophy of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that has impressed me very much is the importance of seeking to treat the young offenders within the home framework, and with the consent of the parent, where it is necessary to do so, to mark disapproval with the support and approval of the parent. Keeping in, both at school and at home, is one of the classic punishments. This point was made to me very strongly—and I am sure he will not mind my saying it—by the chief probation officer in Hertfordshire. The curfew order used in this way mirrors in so many ways the kind of punishment that sensible parents might enforce for misbehaviour on the part of their child or teenager in the ordinary place. That fact—the fact that it is done at home, that it involves the parent and that it does not involve a custodial sentence—should cause the Committee to think very carefully and constructively about the benefits of this new clause. I am sure that hon. Members will have comments to make on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the question of penalty for breach of the orders, because one has to recognise that a curfew order will not always be maintained. In correspondence and discussions that I have had, the first thing that people tend to raise is the enforceability of this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. and learned Friend moves on to the penalties, this might be a logical point to raise this query. Subsection (5) of new clause 57 says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where such an order has been made and it appears on information to a justice acting for a relevant petty sessional area that the offender has been in breach of the order …"</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. and learned Friend envisage that this information would be provided by the police? In other words, would this be an additional duty for the police to check up on their rounds, in the homes where this order applies? If so, how frequent would that responsibility be on the police and does my hon. and learned Friend think that it might have implications for police or local authority manpower?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that point now because it is one of the matters that I was going to discuss when dealing with the enforceability. One is seeking to enforce a curfew order in circumstances where a young person has, let us say, been out on the town all too frequently and got into trouble in the evenings, and the court feels that it would be right that he or she should stay at home with their parents for a period. We presuppose that they breach the order. What is likely to happen? It seems to me that the overwhelming probability of the breach of an evening curfew order is that the child or young person is very rapidly likely to return to the haunts and habits that got him or her into trouble in the first place. They will be back on the streets and in the pubs, causing criminal damage or getting into trouble at a disco or wherever it happens to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although on the odd occasion a curfew order may be breached with impunity and will not come to the notice of the police, if it happens with any kind of regularity during the period of the order, it is extremely likely—this seems to be the view of those in the probation and social services with whom I have had the benefit of discussing this, as well as with magistrates—that the young people concerned will bring themselves rapidly back to the notice of the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a major distinction to be drawn between somebody who deliberately breaches the order and goes back to his old ways, and the occasion where, perhaps, one slips down to the corner shop for a bag of crisps and then back home. That, of course, is a technical breach of the order, which should not happen, but is not the principal mischief at which the order would be directed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only comparable order of which I know is a rather silly one introduced about two years ago for licensing premises, where a magistrate could bar an offender from licensed premises for a certain period. Has the hon. and learned Gentleman any statistics to indicate the effectiveness of that? I opposed it constantly on the basis that it was unenforceable, and should like to know what its impact was before I supported an order that looks equally unenforceable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman can give us any statistics if they exist. Referring to what my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin said, it is correct that the power to impose a curfew is one of the conditions of bail that has been in
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
force for some time. While I do not know of statistics in relation to it, I know that senior and respected justices and senior members of the Magistrates' Association regard it as having been a successful and effective addition to the powers in relation to bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wandsworth will know of justices with significant Inner London experience who believe that that order is beneficial as an alternative penalty available to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman compare the curfew that is used as a condition of bail and the curfew that he is proposing? The responsibility for keeping the curfew as a condition of bail lies squarely with the defendant, whereas the responsibility for keeping the curfew that the hon. and learned Gentleman is suggesting will lie with a third party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can compare those two aspects. It is helpful of the hon. Lady to give that comparison, which reinforces the arguments in favour of the new clause. She is right in saying that in the case of bail the responsibility falls fairly and squarely upon the person who has been placed on bail. The responsibility for obeying a curfew order such as I suggest remains fairly and squarely with the person against whom the order has been made, but it is reinforced by the fact that the parent, by granting consent, also takes on a responsibility. There is, therefore, a dual responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of bail, the person knows that if it is breached he may well find himself taken into custody, and to some extent there is perhaps an even more formidable penalty hanging over him for breach than in the case of the curfew order. I shall discuss enforceability in greater detail later. We do not wish to see those who would not otherwise have been sent to prison finding themselves sent there because they have breached the curfew order. Nevertheless, appropriate penalties will be available to the courts in the case of breach, to which I now conveniently turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that offenders breach the order and are brought back before the courts. I will deal in a moment with the mechanism by which they may be brought back and with the question of police involvement. The clause provides that the courts shall have the power to resentence them for the original offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be an appropriate penalty in those cases? As a result of this wise and sensible Bill, a wide range of measures will be available. The child or young person would know that it would be possible for the courts to impose a custodial sentence, and I think that would have some deterrent effect—rather similar to going into custody in the case of bail. I think, and those with whom I have discussed the new clause and who support it think, that the kind of penalty that would be most appropriate would be either a fine or a sentence to a period at an attendance centre. Those would be highly appropriate penalties in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the fine—and I make this point against myself on one of the detailed aspects of the drafting of the Bill, which I thank the Home Office for drawing to my attention—under the general structure of the Bill the parent would have a responsibility for ensuring that the fine was paid. That is something that the court would consider carefully in the case of a child or young person who was brought back before it. The court would consider carefully
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
whether the parent, whose consent was a pre-condition of the making of the order, had sought to exercise his or her responsibilities, and whether it was in any way the parents fault that the child had kicked over the traces and breached the curfew order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases where the parent had been lax in his duties or responsibilities, the fact that the fine had to be paid by him might well be a thoroughly appropriate reinforcement. In cases where the parent had done his or her best, it would be quite inappropriate, and the court would have all the power and flexibility necessary to deal with that. In that
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
context subsection (11) of the new clause as drafted would have to be deleted. It would not be wholly appropriate, since section 55 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 deals with that aspect. I understand that the drafting is not quite correct in the context of the new clause. However, it would be desirable that the parent, as well as the child, takes that consideration into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
