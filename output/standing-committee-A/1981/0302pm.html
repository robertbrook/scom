	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to amendment No. 61. The right hon. and learned Member for Dul-wich (Mr. Silkin), who tabled the amendment is not present, but it is open to any hon. Member to move it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has offered to move the amendment formally, and I am pleased to speak on behalf of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), who cannot be here. His contributions have been extremely intelligent and sensible. I am sure that he would not want the amendment to fall because of his unavoidable absence from the sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with payment of fines by parentsand guardians. It will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"the duty of the court to order"</p></blockquote>
that such fines be paid by the parent or guardianunless it is satisfied in two ways:
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<ol>
	<li>"that the parent or guardian cannot be found; or</li>
	<li>that it would be unreasonable to make an order forpayment, having regard to the circumstances of the case."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the court shall order a parent or guardian to pay instead of the child or young person, but it can order him to pay only the whole fine, the whole compensation, or the whole costs. Either the entire sum is paid by the parent or, in certain circumstances, the entire sum is paid by the child. There seems to be no provision for partial payment by a parent and partial payment by a child. The amendment seeks to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or a specified part thereof."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it would be possible, as the court sees fit, for the parent to pay a part, and the child to pay a part. That seems to be a sensible provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be circumstances where, from the financial point of view, the parent might be able to pay some, but not all, of the fine. Similarly, the child might be able to pay some, but not all of the fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the question of who can afford to pay, there is the question of criminal responsibility. Here again, there may be cases where the court feels that the criminal responsibility does not he entirely with the parent, having failed to exercise due care and control, or with the child, with the parents being blameless. There may be occasions when the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
court feels that the criminal responsibility for the offence could be due partly to the parent, who had not exercised due care and control, and partly to the child. Therefore, the court might feel that it would like to impose a fine on both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why I believe that the amendment would improve the clause is that the clause itself has been put in by the Government with a great fanfare of trumpets in their paper on young offenders. They say that at the moment there is no clear judicial interpretation of the scope of the provisions and that the courts have been reluctant to use the ability to fine parents because of the uncertainty about their ambit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Courts have been reluctant; either they did not know that the provisions existed, or they were not clear about the powers. We are led to believe that the purpose of the clause is to strengthen and clarify the existing provisions. If my right hon. and learned Friend's amendment were inserted to widen the provisions to permit part of the fine to be paid by the parent and part by the child, the provisions in the clause would be clarified and strengthened and made even more sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good case has been and can be made for not fining parents on principle on the grounds that it would impose an unreasonable burden on people of low income and the unemployed, or, in the case of a strained relationship between a young offender and his parents, it would result in resentment that could only damage that relationship further. In other cases, parents may have done everything possible to discipline and control the young person, and the imposition of a fine would be unjustified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those points may be raised on other amendments. However, the main argument for this amendment rests on the fact that it broadens the options open to a court and accepts that in many cases the blame is not entirely on one side or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be difficult—as it is in a marriage breakdown—for a court to lay all the blame on one side or the other. The court should be able to say in the case of a young offender that because neither the parents nor the young offender were blameless, both should be fined or made to pay the costs. Obviously, the court takes into consideration both the financial aspect and the question of criminal responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great care to the hon. Lady on that point, and I sympathise with it. However, what would happen if split fines were imposed and one of the parties did not pay the fine and the other one did? Would it be the case, under the amendment, that the party who had paid the fine would automatically take responsibility for paying the unpaid part left by the other party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ability to pay would obviously be a factor taken into consideration by the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one of the parts of the fine imposed by the court were not paid by one of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
parties, would the other party have to take responsibility, under the amendment, for that part, or would it be left unpaid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would present the same problem as a parent who was unable to pay the whole fine or a child who was unable to pay the whole fine. The court would take the same measures if one-half or one-quarter of the fine were not paid as it would if the whole fine were not paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, has the hon. Lady considered section 81 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, which provides that where a juvenile has defaulted on the payment of a fine, the parent may be made to pay the unpaid balance where that is reasonable? We appear to have come full circle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still fail to see that there is any difference between that situation and the fine being imposed entirely on a parent or entirely on a child. Either party could default. My right hon. and learned Friend's amendment provides part of the fine to be paid by the child and part by the parent, as the court thinks fit. That seems very simple to me. The Bill already provides for one or other to pay. I propose that in certain cases it should be divided between the two. It is a most reasonable amendment and typical of my right hon. and learned Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the sympathy of the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) with the right hon. Lady's view. However, I also share the hon. Gentleman's doubts about splitting the fine into two parts, one part to be paid by the parent and one by the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to address my remarks to amendment No. 61. The amendment seems to shift the presumption of who should bear the punishment from the child, where it is at present, to the parent, where it would be under the terms of the Bill. When defining where presumptions should lie, it is not a bad guide to ask where they lie in people's minds at present. I wonder where, in the generality of juvenile cases, the presumption of guilt lies in the minds of magistrates and in the minds of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that no more general statement can be attempted than that in many instances the presumption of guilt lies with the parent, while in many others it lies at least partly with the offender. To nudge the presumption further in one direction or the other by some abstract instruction would simply set up tensions between legislation and common sense which are unlikely to be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is all the instruction that we are able to give without distorting common sense, I believe that that is all that we should give. The old instruction under the Children and Young Persons Act—whatever may have been its original purpose—had the practical effect of discouraging courts from penalising parents unless there seemed some overriding reason to do so. That may be not least because words such as " conduce " are rather difficult to understand, and the average magistrate on the Clapham omnibus
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
is unlikely to have a clear idea of what the word means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as worded would encourage the courts to fine the parents unless some overriding reason not to do so occurred to them. The amendment seeks to cast the presumption neither in that direction nor where it was before, but to leave the courts absolute discretion about which way the presumption should lie. I am not sure whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman's wording is right, or whether it would achieve the effect that he wants. But I believe that he is right in seeking to achieve that effect. Therefore, I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will keep an open mind about whether the wording can be altered in some way that accords with the intentions of the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving late, and for not having heard all the previous discussion of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very concerned about any proposal to change the position of parents in the courts. I understand that powers exist to fine parents, but that those powers are used only when the court considers that particular circumstances make it desirable and necessary. However, the Government intend in the clause that only in exceptional circumstances should parents not be fined if their children are found guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a proposal assumes that it is almost always the fault of the parents that their children happen to be in trouble and in court. I suggest that, although in some instances that may be true, in a larger proportion of cases there has been a breakdown in the relationships between parents and their children—or between the parent and the child or children—and that one of the unfortunate consequences is that the child has gone off the rails, got into trouble and come into court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder how the Government's proposal would work in practice. Do they intend that the court should summon the parents to appear and question them about their attitudes towards their children and their children's wrongdoings to establish whether it is appropriate for the parents to be fined? If there is no procedure for involving the parents before the courts, I do not see how the courts can reach the conclusion suggested in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ryman	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Blyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The parents are in court already under the present law because, when a juvenile appears in court, a parent normally accompanies him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Normally, but not always, the parents sit there but take no direct part in the proceedings. Does the Minister envisage that when those up to the age of 17 appear before the court, the court would subject the parents to a certain amount of questioning to establish their responsibility in the circumstances which had led their child to offend?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as is more often than not the case, one of the contributory factors is a breakdown in the relationship between parents and children, an interview
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
with the parents in court about that relationship would set a dangerous precedent as it would subject the parents to an extremely humiliating procedure. They would have to explain what their relationship with their child had been, how it had broken down, and why they had failed as parents. That can hardly be desirable. If in the end the court is satisfied that it is not the parents' fault, sometimes, albeit not publicly as the courts are not public as those for older offenders are, parents undergo the humiliating process of having to admit their failures in their relationships with their children. That cannot be desirable, but I cannot see how the proposal could be applied without that procedure of interrogation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will think again, because the consequences of the suggested process could be damaging, could worsen family relationships and could make it more difficult for the offender and his parents to be reconciled rather than estranged. I hope that the Minister will not proceed with the proposal, but, if he insists on doing so, he ought to say more about how he envisages it working in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has extended a little more widely than the precise terms of amendment No. 61 which was tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) but which was eloquently moved in his absence by the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), but I do not criticise that. For some time, the law has provided that in a proper case a court may in the case of 14 to 17-year-olds, and must in the case of 10 to 14-year olds, order the parents of a juvenile offender to pay the fine imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is a proper case? Existing law says that the court shall do that where it is reasonable to do so or—I paraphrase for the moment—where the parent has conduced to the commission of the offence because he or she has wilfully neglected to exercise proper care or control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) rightly said, the language here is rather formidable, and courts—especially magistrates courts—have understandably fought clear of it. The word " conducing " is not generally employed. Perhaps a " conducer " is a conductor on an omnibus; I do not know. We should not wish to tie our decision to such a word if we were sitting in a judicial capacity. It is widely agreed that this power has to some extent been neglected because the courts are somewhat shy of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally the case, in my experience, that most of our constituents think that it is good that the courts should have the power to bring home to parents their responsibility for what their children have done where it is fair to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier sitting, the hon. Member for Orms-kirk (Mr. Kikoy-Silk) said that parents should recognise that they had a responsibility for what their children did. In the great majority of cases, parents have a proper understanding of their responsibilities and do their best; but a minority do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
We proceed from the basis that it is desirable that this power should exist. The next sensible step is to see that the power is expressed as plainly as possible, provided that it does not result in injustice for the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) asked how one could find out whether the power was reasonable. New clause 22 reverses the presumption and says that the court shall do it in all cases. The clause abolishes the distinction at present in operation between the 10 to 14-year-old and the 14 to 17-year-old and says for juveniles as a whole that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be the the duty of the court to order…unless…it would be unreasonable in the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the court wants to know about the circumstances. Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An order … may be made against a parent oi guardian who, having been required to attend, has failed to do so."</p></blockquote>
It follows that the court in all circumstances would be obliged, before making such an order, to require the attendance of the parent and to make such inquiries as the circumstances of the case necessitate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 55(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act ensures that a parent has an opportunity to be heard but does not oblige the parent to submit to examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I followed with interest the remarks of the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs). I do not think that we should be too upset by the prospect of a parent submitting to questions about what has gone wrong. It is part of our purpose to bring home the fact that there is a family responsibility for what youngsters do when they go wrong, in the same way as a family is entitled to take credit when things go right and a child behaves in a creditable manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is part of our purpose that family responsibility as a whole should be engaged and emphasised. I am not deterred from arguing the merits of this case by the fact that parents might be embarrassed or humiliated, as the hon. Gentleman said, by having to admit to failures with their children. If one has failed with a child and the child has gone out and hurt someone, it is not necessarily bad that one should be made to face the fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's amendment is that, if we want to do this, we should at least provide that the court may order only part of the fine to be paid. I see some force in that line of argument. Therefore, when I am asked not to have a closed mind about the matter, I can say that my mind is not closed. However, there are substantial difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1977, section 36 of the Criminal Law Act has contained the provision, where a juvenile has defaulted on the payment of a fine, and has been found to have had the means to pay but has wilfully refused to do so—so there is no question of his not being able to—for a court to order the parents to pay the unpaid amount where it would be reasonable. I emphasise those words, because they form the substance of another amendment proposed to this clause. That provision was introduced by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
previous Administration. The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) held my present post in the Home Office at that time. He was content, as was the entire Committee, so far as I can ascertain, to accept that formula. There was no debate on clause stand part. It has given rise to no reported case in which difficulty has been occasioned. That provision is now consolidated in section 81 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose the court were to say "All right, Mr. Mayhew. We think that you have failed with your children. You are not wholly to blame "—at least I hope that they would say that because, as I have four children, it would likely be expensive. " We think, therefore that justice will be done if we order you to pay 60 per cent, of the fine that we have imposed upon your child." Suppose my child does not pay his part of the fine. Immediately, section 81 of the Magistrates' Courts Act would be engaged and the court could, if it felt reasonable to do so. make me pay the remainder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great difficulties would be caused, involving the amendment of that provision. We should end up with a tremendous meal being made of a procedure intended to be ancillary to the court's power to fine a juvenile. It is ancillary, because the principal purpose of the procedure is to punish the juvenile. The ancillary purpose is to bring home to the parent that they also have a responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what lies behind the amendment, and I give great weight to the idea that apportionment according to perceived degrees of responsibility is generally thought to be fair. However, the difficulties that we shall run into are considerable. There is also the question of compensation. A child and his parents may be held equally responsible for an offence and an order for compensation be divided between them, but the parent will have ample means and the child none. If compensation of £600 were awarded, and payment was ordered to be shared equally, assuming that the child had no means, the victim might get only £300 at most. The courts might feel bound, in the interests of the victim, but ignoring the painstaking care that it had taken to apportion responsibility, to make the parent pay the whole £600.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an open mind, and I shall consider the matter further, but I felt it my duty to make it clear that there are substantial obstacles. If that will assist the hon. Lady, I shall feel that I have not detained the Committee in vain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for that moderate concession.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) is not present, I shall speak to amendment No. 62, and leave my hon. Friend theMember for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) to deal with the other amendments, if she chooses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 62 would, in a sense, undermine the effectiveness of the clause. Because that is so, the amendment points to the dilemma in the clause. The Minister said that under existing law, the presumption was that up to the age of 14 the child could not pay and therefore the court must order a fine against the parent. After 14, the presumption is that the child may have sufficient pocket money to pay, and, in those circumstances, the order should be made against the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has taken the view—consistent with his general political approach—that all the current incidence of crime amongst juveniles is the fault of parents, and therefore we must assume that the fine should always be imposed on the parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Committee an example of a girl of 11 who had been scrupulously brought up by eminently respectable parents. Neither they, nor any of their family, had been in any trouble. The girl became involved in a bit of a lark in her class. The children went to a local shop and did some shoplifting by encouraging the shopkeeper to turn the other way. They all thought that it was a great

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
joke until the shopkeeper found out what was going on, managed to detain the girl, brought her to the police station and insisted on her being charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the child was 11, the police took the correct view that she should be cautioned. She is now 18 and about to go to university; she has been in no trouble since, and the experience was brought to an end by her father having a word with her. Supposing that she had come before the court at a somewhat later age and the court had the obligation in the clause to fine the parent rather than the child. In such circumstances, the parent might have felt, justifiably, that the interpretation of the situation was completely false. He had done all that he could to bring the child up properly, and if there were fault, it was entirely that of the child. That bodes for a sense of injustice about the crime which I doubt Government Members would approve. Had it been one of the Minister's four children, I think that he might feel less certain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously under a misconception, because the clause—as he will see from the first subsection—provides that the duty to fine the parent shall not obtain where it would be " unreasonable " to do so. That reverses the hon. Gentleman's presumption. He is wrong to say that I think that all crime among the young is the fault of parents. If I thought that, I should be imposing strict liability in the clause instead of giving the let-out of unreasonableness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that; it is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's view is adopted, the assumption has to be, that magistrates will be under a duty, first, to assume that the parent is liable, and, secondly, to hear the case for the parent in order to disprove the initial burden. The burden of proof will be on the parent under the rest of the clause. Only, if at the end, it is thought "unreasonable " to make an order for payment will that duty be disproved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, the Minister would have to go into the box and explain that he was a man of impeccable virtue, who had always looked after his child properly, sent to her Sunday school, had always penalised her when she told lies, and so on. Why should he, in those circumstances? It is totally unnecessary for him to do so. It is clear that my right hon. and learned Friend has tabled the amendment so that instead of the court having to be satisfied that it would be unreasonable to make the order, the test would be—
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the court is satisfied that in all the circumstances it would be just and reasonable to make such an order."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to place the burden on the prosecution to show that it would be just and reasonable, and not on the parent. I sympathise with that, but it would undermine the basis of the first part of the clause, because the assumption written into that part of the clause would then be reversed. If that is so, ought we not simply to leave the court to decide of its own volition whether the child or parent ought to be fined? I am in favour of fining the parent in appropriate circumstances, and the court ought to have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
Perhaps the terms of the existing power are sufficiently elliptic to have caused difficulty in the past. If so, let us have a better drafted clause that does not place the burden on the court of assuming the guilt of either the child or of the parent, but simply says that in all circumstances, where a child or young person is brought before the court and the court wishes to impose a fine, the court must decide whether the fine should be paid by the child or by the parent or, in certain circumstances, should be shared between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enforcibility of that provision would be a matter for the court, and section 88 would still apply: if the parent did not pay, the enforcement of the provision would be normal; if the child did not pay, the enforcement could be made against the parent in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would deal with the situation perfectly well without bringing in the incipent injustice of assuming a parent's guilt until the parent had disproved it. That seems to be what is wrong with the clause. The amendment undermines the clause but, if we were to pass it the Government would have to reconsider their general position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should prefer the Minister simply to say that the matter would be re-examined before Report. The language could be reconsidered to achieve what we both agree to be desirable: that the court should consider fining a parent in every appropriate case, but without coming to that task with a preconceived burden laid upon it by the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends on behalf of the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group. However, before I do that, I ask the Minister to recall our last debate before we adjourned this morning which was on clause 21 stand part. In the course of that debate, I asked the Minister two important questions about whether children in residential homes under residential orders would have home leave and how the finance for residential care orders would be allocated to a local authority. I do not expect hon. and learned Gentlemen to answer those questions now, but we were rather too anxious to have the vote at one o'clock to be able to deal with them adequately this morning. I should like to give him the opportunity to intervene and deal with them either in a quick sentence while you are otherwise occupied, Mr Watkins, or in a letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By leave of the Committee, I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am sorry that I omitted those two questions. The reason was exactly as he supposed. On home leave, the answer is " Yes ".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman and to you, too, Mr. Watkins, for being so helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now address my remarks to amendment No. 48, which specifies the factors which courts would be required to take into account in deciding whether to impose a fine on parents. It embodies recommendations that were made in the parliamentary all-party penal affairs report—" Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was pointed out in a previous debate, the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 enables courts to impose fines on parents if a juvenile has committed an offence and requires courts to do that if the child is under 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill presumes that the parent will pay unless there are good reasons why he should be excluded from the responsibility. As paragraph 54 of the White Paper says, the Bill is supposed to be clarifying and extending the law to encourage the courts to assert that the duty of parents is to have responsibility for the actions of their children and to ensure that parents will take the proper and appropriate steps to prevent their children committing criminal offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us quarrel with that objective. We all want parents to accept responsibility for their children and to take every conceivable practicable step to prevent young people committing further offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A considerable amount of research evidence shows that parental attitude has a significant effect on delinquency. For example, if a parent imposes harsh, lax or even erratic discipline, he is more likely to have delinquent children. Another important factor with regard to delinquency is whether parents take an interest in a child's activities, try to structure and take part in leisure pursuits, and encourage a child in what it does. Research shows that good parents who are involved with, care for and support their children tend not, on the whole, to have delinquent children. Therefore, anything that encourages a parent to be a good parent is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must also question whether the presumption in the Bill may in some circumstances worsen relationships between parents and a young child. For example, the child may be an offender because its relationship with its parent has already broken down. The imposition of a fine on a parent for the behaviour of a child whom he may be unable to contain—he may have done everything possible to prevent him offending—will cause a great deal of resentment and dissatisfaction on the part of the parent and make family relationships much worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
I am sure that both magistrates and the Government agree that if a fine for an offence committed by a juvenile is to have any value, it should be paid by the juvenile to bring firmily home to him the consequences of his actions and ensure that he bears the responsibility for meeting the fine imposed by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other cases, a parent may have done everything that he could reasonably have been expected to do to try to discipline and control his child but was still unable to prevent him offending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that everything that he has said will be taken into account by the court considering the case? The court will take into account the fact that the parents have done everything that could properly be expected of them and in those circumstances will be most unlikely to impose a fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point. If what the hon. Gentleman has said were the case, and if my right hon. and hon. Friends and I could be assured that that would happen in practice, there would be no need for the amendment or for the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is not the case. The Bill does not give the degree of assurance that, for example, we seek in amendment No. 48. The Bill does not mention any of the specifying factors detailed in amendment No. 48. Indeed, when the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group looked at the question, it became clear to us that in many cases the power to impose a fine on parents for an offence by a juvenile could be counter-productive, unless used extremely sensitively. That is why in paragraph 93 we recommended:
	<br><blockquote><p>"legislation concerning the imposition of fines on the parents of juvenile offenders should specify factors which the courts should take into account in deciding whether this course would be unreasonable in the particular case."</p></blockquote>
The amendment lists—as the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) will know if he has read it—what we regard as the most important factors that courts should take into account when deciding whether to exercise the new presumptive power in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not in any way restrict the courts in their consideration of the factors. The courts can go further still and take into account other factors relevant to the case. However, the amendment serves a valuable purpose in drawing the courts' attention explicitly to the importance of the factors specified in the amendment. I had hoped that the hon. Member for Nantwich could have accepted and perhaps supported that aim. I believe that that would ensure that the courts made a sensible and sensitive use of a power which in principle I and my hon. Friends do not oppose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to address a few words to the Committee on what I believe is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. I want to express a certain disquiet about the remarks

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
made by Opposition Members. It seems that some hon. Members are intent on bringing in a great many different amending clauses that would lessen the parental responsibility at the heart of the Bill and which the Bill seeks to give. Because of the Opposition's attitude, any amendments that seek to lessen the effect of parental responsibility must be resisted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Government first made clear their intentions in the White Paper and since Second Reading, many debates have taken place. People have welcomed the provision that parents should now take a greater responsibility for their children. The courts may, rather regrettably, have to force upon those 14 to 17-year-olds the responsibility of paying their fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was perhaps easy for the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) to say earlier that the 14 to 17-year-olds were necessarily those who attracted all the attention. May I remind him of the figures produced by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve)? Crimes that are increasing tend to be committeed by 14 to 17-year-old youths and girls. My hon. and learned Friend will know, as will other hon. Members who represent urban constituencies, that most problems in our towns and cities seem to be caused by young people in that age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is right for the Government to bring forward a Bill such as this with this very important clause. People expect Parliament to make parents far more responsible. It is far too easy for us and for others to make excuses for them—to say, for example, that it is the fault of the school. We have heard much of that over the past few days in the news from Toxteth. It would be equally wrong for us to blame the social worker, who in many instances is trying to cope with jobs almost beyond his capability through no fault of his own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the hooligan element in today's society tends to come from that particular age group. That is why clauses 22 and 23 are so important; I deplore any lessening of parents' responsibility, whatever excuses the Opposition may give. But I believe that at the heart of the Bill is the need for a deterrent value in our legislation. That has not been mentioned much in the Committee or on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If fines are imposed, parents will realise that they must take responsibility for what juveniles are doing. It may hurt their pockets, but whatever their financial circumstances—we appreciate that those will vary— parents will then take a far greater responsibility for the actions of their children. Clause 22 is very reasonable and should stand unamended. Any lessening of its effect would not be welcomed outside the House, and I hope that the Government will resist the Opposition's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said, on an earlier amendment, that it would be no bad thing if parents were encouraged or persuaded to accept their responsibilities. Of course, that is not disputed. However, unlike some Conservative Members—particularly the, hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle)—I do
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
not assume that the majority of parents have no sense of responsibility about how they bring up their children. It is quite the reverse. Only a small minority of parents do not accept responsibility, and I do not believe that by incorporating the clause we will change the attitudes of that small minority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall (Uford, North)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that minority is so small, how does the hon. Gentleman account for the increased figures referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) in that age group?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall explain that. But there is no simple answer which can be encapsulated in a sentence. The majority of parents are responsible, but for reasons about which it is difficult to be precise—reasons which are a reflection on our entire society—they may find that their children have gone off the straight and narrow, that they are misbehaving and at times are getting into trouble with the law. I believe that that is the typical background of many young offenders. Their parents would not wish them to be offenders, and have gone to considerable trouble in using all their powers to prevent those children getting into trouble with the law. But, alas, that fails all too frequently, and we see disturbing figures which show an increase in the crime rate and in the number of young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now referring mainly to young people of 14, 15, 16 and almost 17. Some will have left school, and may be receiving supplementary benefits of £13 or so a week. Let us say that such a young person gets into trouble with the law and is brought before the court. The court finds him guilty, and then has to decide on the nature of parental responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His parents may have done their best to persuade that young person to behave, not to truant from school, not to break the law, to come in at a sensible hour in the evening, and so on. They may have failed in their efforts because of pressures, and because of the way that our society has changed— regrettably, perhaps—over recent years. But the court will not possess that information. Without investigating the matter in some detail, the court will know only whether the offender is living at home, whether he has one or two parents, and so on. Under the clause, the court must presume that the parents are responsible, but have not accepted their full responsibilities and, therefore, should have to bear the burden of the fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a court is to behave sensibly it will want to examine the matter further. Indeed, parents may wish to make a plea in order to explain their circumstances, and that is where difficulties will arise. Parents may not be articulate, may never have been in court before, and may feel insecure about explaining one of the most difficult human relationships —that between parents and children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents may be bewildered by what is happening and dismayed that their son—it will probably be a son and not a daughter—has got into trouble with the law for stealing from shops or whatever. They will be in difficulty, will almost inevitably be without the benefit of legal advice—I am sure that the Minister will not suggest that legal aid should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
made available for parents in such circumstances— and will have to explain the nature of their relationships with their child, and the years in which it has gone wrong and the child has become an offender. That is one of the most difficult things to explain in a court of law. It is easier to say: " Yes, I did steal from that shop " or, " No, I was not in the shop at the time of the offence ". It is very difficult to talk about the nature of human relationships without the benefit of legal advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that just one of the excuses to which I referred: that, because a parent is inarticulate, he is not capable of bringing up his children? The hon. Gentleman paints a sad picture, and if it is true and we accept what he said, the responsibility must be taken by someone else. That is what worries me about his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman believes that to be the case, and that such parents are anxious to look after their children, he is living in cloud-cuckoo-land. He has only to go to a football match on a Saturday afternoon and see what some youngsters get up to, knowing that their parents are fully cognisant of their activities, to learn otherwise. The hon. Gentleman says that because parents are inarticulate and cannot take responsibility, someone else should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made so many errors it is difficult to know where to begin. I shall confine myself to the following points about his observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, when I say that parents may be inarticulate, it is in the context of their standing up in a court of law and explaining the nature of their relationship with their child. I am not suggesting that whether people are articulate or not influences their relationship with their child or influences whether the child is an offender. To do so would be too facile. I have in mind the daunting experience for people who have never stood up in public before of having to explain such a difficult relationship in a court of law while seeking in some way to exonerate themselves from' their own sense of failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does the hon. Gentleman suggest that a 16 or 17-year-old who goes to a football match and behaves in a way which earns the hon. Gentleman's and, no doubt, my disapproval, could have been prevented from doing so by his parents saying "No, you may not go to Chelsea or to Spurs on Saturday afternoon."? [HON MEMBERS: " Yes."]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed that hon. Members acknowledge that they expect parents to forbid young men of nearly 17 going to a football match on a Saturday afternoon. I am surprised that hon. Members are so lacking in understanding of what life is like and of the natural spirits and exuberance of young people. I do not condone everything that goes on at football matches, but to suggest that it is somehow possible to forbid young people going out and about on a Saturday afternoon is totally absurd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, there is no answer to that. The fact is that in today's society it is absurd to suggest that a 16-year-old should be prevented by his parents from going to a football match. After all, it is most unlikely that the parents will go to the football matches to be seen at the Shed at Chelsea on a Saturday afternoon. Therefore, we rely on newspapers to tell us some of the things that go on at football matches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not think that parents can make the decision, does he accept that the court can make a decision to prevent their 16-year-old going to a football match? Is it not the same? Have the parents absolved their responsibility as when the child offends the court has to make the decision for them, because they are not capable of making it themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a difference. A young person who has offended comes before a court and faces the court's decision that he should go to an attendance centre on a Saturday afternoon—that has the purpose of keeping him away from the football terraces. That is a clear decision by a court of law: the young person has been found guilty and has been sentenced to be otherwise occupied on Saturday afternoons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite different to say that parents should forbid their children going to football matches on a Saturday afternoon when those parents may not know how each youngster will behave. One cannot presume that every young person will misbehave at the Shed end at Chelsea on a Saturday afternoon, simply because we know that such things, regrettably, happen at football grounds. It is unrealistic to suggest that parents should make decisions forbidding their children to go out on Saturday afternoons—we are not discussing evenings—because the hon.

For the life of me, I do not see how a parent will know in advance how a 16-year old is likely to behave on a football terrace on a forthcoming Saturday afternoon. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman knows anything about young people. It is he who is living in cloud-cuckoo-land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, some young people behave in an objectionable way on the terraces. But at 16 they are becoming adults and are capable of being allowed out on a Saturday afternoon. Unless the parents have clear evidence and information that their son will inevitably behave in the way that the hon. Gentleman disapproves of on the terraces, I do not see that it is reasonable to expect parents to forbid that young person from attending. In the majority of incidents at football grounds the parents had no idea what was happening, anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The main point concerns, say, a young offender who has stolen from a shop and has been found guilty in court. The court must decide whether to fine the parents in the light of the wording of the new clause, if it becomes law. I am concerned about the court's predicament and, particularly, the predicament of the parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a parent has not accepted responsibility for the child and has behaved as only a bad parent would, the position is clear. I do not take issue on it except to say that it is covered by the present law without this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concerns lies with the parent who regrets and has done so for a long time the trend in his child's behaviour. He has done his best to stop the child behaving in a certain way but, as sometimes happens, has failed. It is not an unusual occurrence. The parent will either shut up, pay the fine and let his son off the hook—he is on supplementary benefit and could afford to pay the fine—or seek to take refuge in the let-out contained in the clause and put the case to the court that he—the parent—should not have to pay the fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That dilemma and the illogicality of placing people in it form my main point. People will be obliged
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
to speak in front of a court, which they may have never done before, and discuss their relationship with their child and explain its failure. We must remember that they are entering the court with the presumption that they are guilty. From the wording of the clause, they will have to prove their innocence and show why it is not reasonable for the court to fine them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents already have a sense of failure about their child's wrong-doing and about their relationship with him and have to face a court which presumes that, unless they can prove otherwise, they are guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to how the parents prove otherwise and, when the evidence before the court is of the wrong-doing of the young person, how they prove that they have been conscientious and over the years have done their best to persuade their child not to behave like that. I find it difficult to see how they will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only comparable issue is when a divorce court has to hear two people talking about the breakdown of a marriage and must come to a decision about custody of children and so on in the light of the marital breakdown as it is put before it. The couple will normally have legal aid or legal advice on that matter, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is much more difficult. It is wrong to subject parents to this provision. The law at present is adequate to fine those parents who are in breach of their responsibilities. The effect of the suggested change in the law would be retrograde and humiliating for people who had done their best by their children. I suggest that it is undesirable. We should amend the clause to make the best of a thoroughly bad proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We arrive at the root of the problem this afternoon because prevention is far better than many of the proposals we have had to debate in Committee. I believe that responsibility starts in the home and that, if that responsibility and discipline are absent from the home, there will be immense problems in the future. Of course, those problems are becoming greater because there are breakdowns in marriage and one-parent families and all the things that create the problems of bringing up young people in a modern society.

I am glad to see the lack of discipline in our schools. Everyone was surprised by what happened at William Tyndale primary school a few years ago.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, because the offenders would often not have the money to pay the fine, as they are often very young people who are still at school. Secondly, if a child is still at school, he is still the responsibility of the parent. That is the point I am trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to bore people with the problems that occur at football grounds except to say that if the clubs find it good enough to ban people who cause hooliganism at their grounds, I believe we are right to discuss the issue. Parents are responsible for children at football grounds because, if a child has reached the age of 15 or 16 and is behaving in that way, the responsibility lies with the parents for allowing their child to reach that situation in his formative years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are right to pursue this policy and the clause. If the Bill brings the responsibility to the individual, it will have achieved much. That responsibility lies with the parent and, if it does not he with him, it must lie with the courts and ultimately with local authorities, social workers and others. The responsibility must lie somewhere, and we shall have achieved much if we encourage it to lie with the parents, where it should start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What the Opposition are seeking, and it is reflected in amendment No. 48, is flexibility about who should pay the fine. It is a question that must be handled with the greatest flexibility and sensitivity. Much has been said this afternoon about discipline and the fact that 16-year-olds—lads or girls—should be more under the guidance of their parents on a Saturday afternoon. I know many parents who, because they are working in the week, spend Saturday afternoons shopping. My brother and sister-in-law, for example, have four children who are as good or bad as their friends. They do not spend every moment of the day discovering precisely where their children are. Conservative Members have suggested that they should.

The new section that amendment No. 48 would insert would give greater flexibility and sensitivity when dealing with the issue of who pays the fine and the circumstances of children and parents. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) when he spoke of the difficulty of parents conveying their relationship with their children in a courtroom. It is often difficult for one-parent families, where one parent has had to assume the role of two, to articulate their feelings about their children or vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) mentioned one-parent families and for whatever reason they are one-parent families it is more difficult for them to cope with two or three children, look after a home and go out to work. Sometimes they have to work on a Saturday as well. The situation is not quite as easy as hon. Members make out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister about the definition of the word "guardian" which is used both in the clause and the amendment. Do the Government intend to include local authorities, or their workers within the scope of the term "guardian" for the purposes of the revised section of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 which appears in clause 22 and the section of that Act which is dealt with in the next clause dealing with compensation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of compensation is connected with this matter, Mr. Watkins. The hon. and learned Gentleman will, of course, know that, according to 	<i>The Times</i> law report for 22 January 1982, the House of Lords held, in the case of Leeds city council, that a local authority could not be included in the definition. That section has now been revised and will be modified by this clause. How will that affect that ruling as regards compensation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards fines, we do not have the benefit of such a recent decision. Will the Minister make it clear whether he intends to bring local authorities within the definition of "guardian" so that they would be subject to the fines under this clause? Is it not appropriate for the Government—or perhaps the Opposition—to table a definition of the word* " guardian " for inclusion in clause 46 on interpretation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, social workers had been operating since 1973 under the impression that the local authority could be ordered to pay compensation. The House of Lords decision altered that ruling, and social workers thought that they had got rid of that uncertainty. If someone has agreed and wishes to take action for compensation against a local authority, he can do so in civil proceedings or through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Fines and costs go into the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be of great assistance to local authorities and the people whom they employ if we clarified whether they fall under the definition of the word "guardian" in the context of fines and com
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
pensation. I hope that the Minister will clarify this point when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had the pleasure—if that is what it was—of listening to many speeches during the proceedings of the Committee. I apologise for not having been present on several previous sittings. Having listened to some speeches this afternoon, I am appalled. On the one hand, Conservative Members seem to be making blimpish, unthoughtful speeches while, on the other hand, some Opposition Members appear to be putting forward extremely naive proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the matter fairly, one is bound to say that the powers of juvenile courts to order parents to pay fines exist under present law and has a useful part to play, but there is a good deal to be said for the amendment, and I ask the Minister of State to consider it carefully for several reasons, some of which have not yet been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, an enormous amount of court time is taken up in juvenile courts in pursuing people who have not paid fines and by long arguments about means and who can and who cannot afford to pay fines. If the Bill becomes law as it stands, nothing will be done to mitigate that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the role of parents in being made to pay fines in certain circumstances, but as the Bill stands I forsee practical difficulties that will engage an enormous amount of court time sorting out the apportionment between parents and children, particularly when one has to investigate the means of both parents and children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good deal to be said for the Opposition's arguments in support of the amendment about the difficulties of parents appearing in court and being cross-examined about their relationship with their children. However, I think that the fears have been exaggerated. That happens frequently in courts of criminal jurisdiction, which are not private and in family division proceedings, which are private. The problem can often be surmounted by employing a welfare officer to investigate the matter fully before it comes to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Opposition's argument that parents would find it distasteful to be asked about their relationships with their children, but the difficulty has been exaggerated. That already happens in the courts with no great harm to parents in the sorts of jurisdictions that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem appears to be that of giving the courts machinery which will be both effective and fair, and which does not waste too much time. One of the tremendous problems of juvenile courts is the great backlog of work and the length of time necessarily taken in juvenile proceedings, where each proceeding is accompanied by a huge amount of documentation—reports from teachers, from social welfare organisations and from many other organisations. Those proceedings will be unnecessarily prolonged if the procedure in the clause is not amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I often worry that the congestion in the courts, the long remands and the long backlog will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
increased unless we tidy up this aspect of the Bill. Will the Minister take that factor into consideration? The very nature of the arguments put forward today about where presumption lies, and what is reasonable and what is unreasonable in certain circumstances, is bound to involve more and more court time—when the courts are already grossly overloaded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the speeches from the Government Benches did not appear very thoughtful. I do not see what help it is for Conservative Members to make speeches stating generalities about such issues as football matches which have no relevance to the difficult clause before us. Of course it is glib and naive to pretend—as reflected in some speeches this afternoon—that this is an easy problem, capable of a simple solution. It is not: it is a difficult problem. I am very suspicious of those who get up from any side of the House who say " Get tough " or " Keep soft" or whatever their formula may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a difficult problem, and the Committee should give the courts the powers required to deal with it, and trust the courts. I am all against Parliament legislating and restricting the discretion of the judiciary to such an extent that certain courses must be followed. All experience of the past few years has shown that at every level of judiciary—whether the Crown Court or magistrates courts—where Parliament has intervened to such an extent that judges' hands are tied, absurd anomalies arise. Those anomalies arise because the courts have to pass sentences that they do not want to pass on the facts of the cases and on the antecedents of the defendants, because Parliament has left them with no option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should consider the amendment on the question of the power of the courts to order parents to pay half of a fine which constitutes part of the sentence imposed on their children. He can then see if some of the difficulties highlighted in the debate can be tidied up. The answer is more difficult than has been suggsted. I should be most grateful if the Minister would consider the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which we should look at the clause and the amendment lies in the notion of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is common agreement in the Committee that parents should—except in very unusual cases—be regarded as being responsible for their children. I know it is an onerous responsibility —I have four children. If parents exercised their responsibility, even according to their lights, better than they do, it would probably be a truism to say that the amount of juvenile crime and crime generally would be a great deal less than it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the clause is to bring home in a forceful way to parents the fact that they are responsible—which means answerable. Therefore if their children commit offences which give rise to penalties in the form of fines, they are answerable to the courts to pay out of their pockets, unless their children pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
The clause puts it in a more positive way. In fact, all that it does is to enact in a positive form—I am certain that that is not fully understood by the nation at large—what already exists in law, namely, that the parents are directly responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents know, as they will rapidly begin to know as the children of their friends come before the courts and are fined, that it is they who have to pay the fine and that it is not a question of that happening at second or third hand possibly long after the event in the minority of cases—as I hope that it will be in most areas where the fine is not paid—it will come home to them immediately that it is they who have the immediate and primary liability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By reason of their position as parents of young offenders they are probably likely to be the principal supplier of the cash with which the fine would be paid in any event, although one hopes that the young person might be earning some money to help to defray the fine. But whichever it is, parents are, by reason of their position, able to ensure that the child makes the payment. It would be right that justices, or any other courts, when inflicting fines on a child should have more regard to the likely means of the child and what would be an effective penalty for that child than what would be an effective penalty for the parent. It is important to make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have any reservation about the clause—I have none in principle—it is that it might give the impression to children and young people that they were not primarily responsible for what they had done. I know that that is in no way the intention of the clause. However, when I look at the wording I ask myself—I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will also re-examine the wording just to ask himself—whether it gets across to the child and to the parent that there is a co-extensive responsibility. The child is responsible for his own actions, but in the end it is the parent who is responsible and it is he who creates the whole home framework and therefor must ultimately exercise the discipline. That has been the theoretical position since 1969. Indeed, it has been the theoretical position in law for much longer than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am wholeheartedly behind the philsophy that underlines the clause and I think that it would be a beneficial part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendment. I do not think that the hon. Members who tabled the amendment are seeking to attack the philosophy of the clause, but I disagree with the amendment on the ground of practicality. If courts are asked to decide on issues of negligence, those are complex and difficult matters. Either one takes the view that the parent is basically responsible, or one is likely to get oneself into arcane discussions on whether negligence weakens the notion of parental responsibility. I do not think that that was the intention of those who tabled the amendment. Therefore, "neglect" is an inappropriate word to put into the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one talks about desirability or the precise relationship of the child to the parent, as the paragraphs in the amendments do, one gets into areas of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
such vagueness that courts would be put into an impossible position. The safety net in the clause is rightly there in the concept of unreasonableness—of not fining the parents in circumstances where it would be unreasonable to put that primary responsibility for the behaviour of the child on to the parent. That is the proper safeguard properly included in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has my wholehearted support. The amendment, however good hearted it is and however much it wants the courts to consider those matters, is inappropriate. When the courts are considering reasonableness, they will be considering most of those matters, but in broader and more practical terms. The only point that I ask my hon. and learned Friend to look at is that it will be brought home to the child that he rather than the parent is being punished for his act but that the responsibility lies fairly and squarely with the parent. If a drafting amendment is required, no doubt it will be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr.Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This evening's debate has been remarkable in that we have heard more speeches from Conservative Members than we have heard in the entire sitting. There are two explanations. Those hon.

We can now proceed normally, and we are glad to hear from Conservative Members on the important matters with which we are dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 22 is not as simple as it seems. Opposition speeches and amendments have shown that we have strong reservations about many aspects of the clause. The amendment tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), who is absent today, is especially impressive. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) that the wording of the clause should be reversed, and that the burden of proof that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in all the circumstances it would be just and reasonable "</p></blockquote>
to make an order should be on the prosecution rather than the parent. The essence of my right hon. and learned Friend's amendment is to remove from parents the onus of showing that they were terribly good parents in every respect, and—in my hon. Friend's illustration—sent their children to Sunday school and reproved them for their deficiencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logic underlying the hon. Lady's argument is that a parent is not responsible for his child. I find it astonishing that the hon. Lady— for whom I have considerable respect—should put forward such a proposition. The hon.

Lady has now suggested that the opposite is true, and that it is for the prosecution to show that the parent should have been responsible. Is that not a serious illogicality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In amendment No. 62, my right hon. and learned Friend is suggesting not that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
parents should not be fined, but that they should be fined
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the court is satisfied that in all the circumstances it would be just and reasonable to make such an order."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, by " in all the circumstances " we mean that while, of course, parents must be responsible for the actions of their children, some parents are nevertheless inadequate. However well-intentioned, such parents cannot control a large, burly 14-year old, although they have tried their best to ensure that he is law-abiding and will not commit offences. The Opposition wish to ensure that in such circumstances the court will not automatically impose the fine on parents who have done their best to stop a child from committing offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr.Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have not said that parents have no responsibility for their children, although that is how they are being interpreted by Conservative Members. My right hon. and learned Friend's amendment states that parents should be fined
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the court is satisfied that in all the circumstances it would be just and reasonable".</p></blockquote>
That is all that the amendment says. There are strong reservations—especially in the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson)—about aspects of fining the parents. That does not mean that we are against any parent ever being fined at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members have talked about what parents do, should do or do not do. Will the Minister consider the views of the National Association of Probation Officers? It speaks from the point of view of people who work with young offenders. On the question of fining parents, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that only in rare cases can parents be regarded as fully culpable in their children's misbehaviour. Parental failure is more often only one in a range of contributory factors and is often related to multiple disadvantages experienced by the parents themselves."</p></blockquote>
That is the opinion of people who work every day with young offenders. They are not speaking as parents, and can perhaps view the matter more objectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will deal with the many and varied points made by the Opposition about these three extremely reasonable amendments, and certainly reconsider the whole clause before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a vigorous but helpful debate. It has certainly shown that a great deal of interest has been expressed by our constituents in these provisions. When I replied on amendment No. 61, I ventured the thought that the majority of our constituents believed it to be a good thing that the law brings home to parents their responsibility for what their children do. We are talking of children up to the age of 17. One thing that has been common ground is that there is a place in the law for provisions which serve to emphasise parental responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Blyth (Mr. Ryman) that we are seeking machinery which is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
both effective and fair to enable the courts to do that. There has been a substantial misunderstanding by some Opposition Members about the quality of what the clause seeks to do. Some have been under the impression that it makes a complete departure from anything that the law has known previously, but that is not right. We should remember that in the case of children aged 10 to 14, the obligation is already upon the courts. A court shall, once it has convicted a child aged 10 to 14, having found him guilty of the relevant offence, make the fine imposed payable by his parents, unless it believes that the parent has not conduced to the commission of the offence through failing to exercise proper care and control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reflects exactly what we seek to do in this clause. In the case of 10 to 14-year-olds, that has been the way that Parliament has approached the matter, right back to 1908. We should reflect that in this case we are simply extending that presumptive duty to 14 to 17-year-olds, and keeping it for the 10 to 14-year-olds. It does not follow that because we have done something since 1908, we should go on doing it. However, it is a fair indication that, if an arrangement has lasted from 1908 and survived a number of consolidating statutes, Parliaments have not found much wrong with the principle. Why parents should in these circumstances be presumed liable to pay a fine imposed upon youngsters, is to be found in the inherent obligations that derive from one's status as a parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) and Orsmkirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) and others have viewed the proposal as though the parent were just anyone in relation to the child. I see that the hon. Member for Battersea, South disagrees. I accept that he does not put it as strongly as that, but let us consider the position from the point of view of society. The very fact that a young person has been convicted of a relevant offence means almost certainly that some innocent person has suffered at his hand. How can we best prevent that happening again?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that we should build upon the legislation which for many years has enabled the court to say that a parent shall pay the fine, with the purpose—as was held in the divisional court recently in the case of Lenihan a year or so ago—that parents should be required to take some responsibility for their children's activities. They should take their duties as parents seriously, but that is not the same as saying that they are absolutely liable for everything that their children do, or that they are vicariously liable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that we should build upon that legislative precedent, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the courts have been frightened off using it because of the language in which it is expressed. So we seek first to make the language simpler—to do away with " conducing " and " the exercising of proper care and control"— and secondly, to enlarge the principle that has applied since 1908 to children aged 10 to 14 that there shall be a duty to impose the fine upon the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
parents unless the court is satisfied that they have not conduced to the commission of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who say that it is wrong to reverse the presumption and place the duty upon the court to fine, unless it is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to do so in the circumstances, neglect the essential responsibility that goes with the status of being a parent. If I were asked whether that status really existed, I would say that Parliament has always accepted—certainly since the passing of the Children and Young Persons Act—that that status is valid and is one upon which it is right to impose in legislation certain obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 is based on a presumption that persons having the custody, charge or care of children are legally liable to maintain them and are under a duty not to neglect or abandon them or otherwise permit them to be ill-treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That duty to maintain and not to abandon, derives from a person's status as a parent. All that the clause seeks to provide is that if a child aged between 10 and 17 has offended against the criminal law and has done something which has resulted in injustice to others, whether it be bodily harm, financial loss, or damage of some sort, that parent is liable to pay, prima facie, the fine that it is appropriate to impose on that child, but it does not impose a standard of strict or absolute liability. If the court is satisfied that, in the circumstances, it would be unjust or unreasonable to make him pay it, he would not have to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that any reasonable and unbiased audience would agree that that is a fair approach. People ask who will decide whether it is unreasonable. Magistrates will usually do so. Who are they? They are people drawn from the community, who represent a political balance in that community, and who live and serve in that community. They are not people with salaries who have to keep their noses clean with their employers. They are totally independent, voluntary judicial officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As magistrates are people of that kind, can it really be said that they will be unable to satisfy themselves sensibly about whether it would be reasonable to impose a fine on a parent in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case put forward of the one-parent family; the mother who has done her best with three or four children but who has had no success in the case of a 16-year-old lad who is out committing violent offences. In such circumstances, a reasonable court will have no difficulty in deciding whether it would be reasonable to make such a person, living on supplementary benefit, pay the fine that it is appropriate to impose on the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to something I have said with wearying frequency. In the end it depends on whether one trusts the people to whom the judicial responsibility is given. When Parliament has sought to set out line by line the circumstances in which a court may exercise a particular discretion, it nearly always becomes nonsense, as the hon. Member for Blyth said, because one cannot legislate to cover every possible set of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>375</span>
The clause sets out the standard of whether something is unreasonable and builds upon the status of parenthood, which most people recognise as imposing certain obligations. It also builds on the presumption which has been in law since 1908, that if a fine is imposed on a child between the ages of 10 and 14, it will be paid by the parent. That presumption may be rebutted. I do not think that there is anything impractical, unreasonable or lacking in common sense in the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blyth also said that it would take a long time to sort out how the fine would be apportioned between parent and child. That is a good argument against the amendment tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) which would permit apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) said that the parent creates the whole home framework. That was a succinct way of expressing what I have been saying in the past few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We condole with the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) on the misfortunes of her football club. The hon. Lady asked whether I agreed with the National Association of Probation Officers that parents should be regarded as fully culpable only in rare cases. Of course I agree that only rarely are parents fully culpable and in those cases they should be prosecuted for conspiring to commit the offence. It is rare that that will be the case. If a child has committed theft, the parent could be fully culpable only if he had reduced the child to a zombie that had no sense of right or wrong, and in that case the child would not have been guilty of the offence anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about the parent being fully culpable, but about a case in which the magistrates believe that it would not be unreasonable in view of all the circumstances to make that parent pay the fine. If there is no culpability—there will be many more cases where there is no culpability than where there is full culpability—it would be unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 would insert the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the court is satisfied that in all the circumstances it would be just and reasonable to make such an order ".</p></blockquote>
I do not think that it is right to derogate from the advantages which I have sought to describe of the change made to present law by the clause. The reversal of the presumption is the right way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendments Nos. 49 and 63 the question is whether we want to list circumstances that the court should take into account. I think that it is right to leave the matter broad and large and for the court to decide whether the order is unreasonable. I am fortified in that view by the precedent of the Criminal Law Act 1977 which says that in the case of a child who has defaulted in an order to pay a fine the court may, if it is reasonable, order the parent to pay the money. The provision is not qualified by saying that this or that consideration
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
should be taken into account. That Act was introduced by the previous Government and has given rise to no difficulties. As far as we know, no reported case has given rise to the slightest difficulty. The provision was embodied in the consolidating statute in 1980, and we can draw some reassurance from that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer that the provision should rest on the term "reasonable " and I invite the Committee to prefer that broad and large criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of amendment No. 48 the hon. Member for Ormskirk had to add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"as well as to any others which appear to be relevant".</p></blockquote>
It gives a guide, but recognises that there have to be others. I do not think that the courts need that guide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 63 sets out a comprehensive list but does not permit the courts to look at any other aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the question. The unanimous judgment of the House of Lords in the Leeds city council case was a clear and helpful decision. The Government have no immediate plans to reverse its effect. The House of Lords said that a local authority should not be regarded as a guardian for the purposes of being ordered to pay a financial penalty imposed on a child in its care. In the Government's view, that does not detract from our proposals in clause 22. The position of local authorities in law has never been entirely clear and it is helpful to have had it settled. We do not propose to make a change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention is and always was to make parents and individuals acting as guardians of children who commit criminal offences face their moral and financial responsibilities. A local authority with a child in its care is carrying out a statutory duty usually imposed on it by a court. It has no option but to take charge of that child, however disturbed he is and however bad his upbringing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House of Lords has taken the view that in those circumstances it is not right that the authority should be made liable for the payment of financial penalties imposed on a juvenile in care. I believe that that ruling extends to compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that judgment cover both compensation fines and costs? That was one of the points that was not clear before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In my view the principle is applied to compensation and costs in the same way as it is to fines. It would be illogical for a different decision to be taken. If, on reflection, I find that that should not be the case I shall write to the hon. Lady. I hope that she will permit me to deal with the matter in that way.

I trust, therefore, that on reflection the Committee will understand, perhaps more clearly than it did at the outset of our proceedings, the purpose of this important clause. It is a sensitive clause, and the Government will, of course, consider the 	<i>Official Report</i> of what has been said here. I believe that we are right. I hope that the Committee will now understand the purpose of the clause, will agree that the clause has been drafted in a manner which is preferable to the amendments, and that we can proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Late in the consideration of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 there was a debate on whether it should be an offence for farmers to plough up the pathways across their fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party regarded the amendment innocuous and likely to lead to little discussion. In fact, we opened up deep areas of party controversy based upon class distinction which led to a violent debate that lasted several hours. I think that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dul-wich (Mr. Silkin), when he was sitting quietly in the Library composing the amendment, could hardly have guessed that it would lead to the dialectical division that we have heard this afternoon in response to what seems to me an innocuous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the Minister replied for about 25 minutes, but dealt with the arguments on the amendment in two lines. That is a fair guide to the relevance of most of the discussion that the amendment has aroused. All that the amendment requires is that the court should have the power to award a fine against a parent as well as against a child. The only issue is under what circumstances there should be a burden upon the prosecution to prove culpability in the parent, or on the parent to disprove the culpability on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the only issue in the clause, and no one is arguing about it. If that is the case surely the Minister could have applied his mind to that simple point. We could have had an explanation from him such as "Yes, we understand perfectly well that the court should have a free right to choose whether to award a fine against the parent or against the child—or both in certain circumstances—and it should be enforceable in the normal way ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it may be necessary in certain circumstances to fine the parent, because the parent has clearly failed to exercise his proper responsibility over the child. There must be an enormous number of cases where it would not be fair, just or reasonable to do so. In fact, in one phrase which proved unfortunate for the Minister, he conceded that point. He said that in a majority of cases it would not be just and reasonable to award a fine against the parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the majority of cases are to be settled after the burden of proof is on the parent, surely it would be better that we look at the majority of cases where the parent is innocent and frame the legislation to cope with them. On that basis one at least ought to say that the burden of proof should be on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
prosecution and it should then be left to the court to decide—of its own volition—whether it is reasonable to fine the parent or the child, or both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer the legislation to be drafted in that way. The Minister has not conceded that, and therefore I think that the proper course is for the Committee to vote on my right hon. and learned Friend's amendment, and if the amendment is accepted the Government can reconsider the matter before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr.Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 26, line 1, leave out from " made " to end of line 3 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the parent or guardian has received notice that such an order might be made and of the grounds upon which the court considers that it might be made and has been given an adequate opportunity to be heard and if he so desires, to be legally represented ".</p></blockquote>
I move the amendment on behalf of my right hon. and learned Friend. There may be a vote at the end of our debate. We may be provoked to press the amendment to a Division just because we are losing our audience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another of my right hon. and learned Friend's intelligent and sensible amendments that clarify the Bill and make it more sensible. It follows from his other amendments in connection with the payment of fines by parents and guardians. It is self-explanatory. It is only fair to the parent or guardian that he should receive a notice that such an order may be made and that he should be notified of the grounds upon which the court considers that it may be made. He should also be given an adequate opportunity to be heard and, if he so desires, to be represented legally. All that seems eminently sensible. There is nothing more to be said in justification of the amendment. I hope that the Minister can accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have complete sympathy with anybody who wants to see fairness and justice characterising our arrangements in the Bill, but I do not think that the amendment is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that parents have the right to be heard before they can be ordered to pay fines. They not only have a right to be heard before they can be ordered to pay costs or compensation orders imposed on their children but they are also given a right of appeal. I doubt whether we need to go further in the way the amendment suggests.

6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich wants parents and guardians to be given notice that
<br><br><!-- lb -->
an order for payment may be made against them. Rule 11(1) of the Magistrates' Courts (Children and Young Persons) Rules 1970 already provides that the court, before finally disposing of a case, shall inform the child or young person—and his parent or guardian if present—of the manner in which it proposes to deal with the case, and allow them to make representations. Clause 22 already reinforces the parent or guardian's right to be heard, stating that the order imposing a fine on a parent in such circumstances
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be made against a parent or guardian who, having been required to attend, has failed to do so, but, save as aforesaid, no such order shall be made without giving the parent or guardian an opportunity of being heard."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is not necessary. We should try to avoid putting unnecessary material into statutes; it leads to unexpected and undesired consequences. Therefore, much as I should like to end today's proceedings on a conciliatory and harmonious note, I am not able to accommodate the hon. Lady by advising the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman underestimates the sagacity of my right hon. and learned Friend, who would not have put down his amendment in a frivolous or offhand way. He thinks for a long time before he speaks or writes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given a passionate explanation of the parents' right to be heard and to appeal. But my right hon. and learned Friend's amendment asks that notice of such an order should be given and that the parent or guardian—although he has no rights to be heard—should be able, if necessary, to be legally represented. I heard no explanation from the Minister on those two points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that I did not discuss the matter of representation. For that matter, the hon. Lady did not do so either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are left to speculate about what the right hon. and learned Gentleman may have said in support of his amendment, although we are informed by the hon. Lady of the way in which he would have said it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
If the court were to give notice of the grounds on which it considers that an order for payment might be made against a parent or guardian, the most relevant of the guidelines suggested by the right hon. and learned Gentleman is likely to be that he has caused or contributed to the juvenile's offence by his conduct or by neglecting the child. The amendment goes on to discuss legal representation, but it is possibly making too much of a meal of the matter to ask the Government to ensure that there should be legal representation for a parent in such circumstances. It is surely not too difficult to explain the circumstances in which relationship between parent and child has developed. Although I am reluctant to suppose that there are no circumstances in which members of my profession can assist the court, I do not know that we should go down that road. In other words, I do not think that it is necessary to provide for legal representation. That is making far too heavy weather of clause 22. We have no wish to put the parents on trial or, in effect, to charge them with offences. We want to avoid putting magistrates in the position of denying juveniles and their parents the option of a fine in order to avoid a mass of legal safeguards and procedures. There is a real danger that they will turn to more expensive and less satisfactory disposals or even to custodial sentences. That would be bad for the law and would do little to bring home to parents their basic responsibility and might make a relatively light penalty too complicated and unattractive for the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as the right hon. and learned Gentleman would not have set pen to paper to produce the amendment frivolously—I would never accuse him of frivolity—so I have given it my best consideration. I was rightly rebuked for not dealing with the second part of the amendment, but I cannot recommend the Committee to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
