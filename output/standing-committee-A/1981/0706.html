	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 4, line 11, after "husband", insert "or unmarried minor child".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first two groups of amendments relate to the proposal to replace the claim for damages for loss of expectation of life by an action for bereavement. We understand the reasons for the proposal and we approve of it and support it. But we have two criticisms. If the damages are limited to a conventional figure, and that is the subject of the next two amendments, it follows that the more relatives there are to share that sum the less there will be for any one person—the less cake there will be to go round. The two groups of amendments go together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our colleagues from Scotland are not troubled by this. I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) what was the view of both the Law Society of Scotland and those who have considered these matters on behalf of Scotland. He replied that they do not have a view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event the figure will appear derisory if one takes a small conventional sum and then divides it among the family. If the family is extremely large the division of the sum may well border on the ridiculous. However, that is the only reason that I understand for excluding children from the range of beneficiaries. Will the Committee bear in mind that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 would remove that objection? We propose that damages be enlarged so that the number of claimants will not prejudice the amount awarded to any of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should no claim be made in cases of a child's bereavement? Does not a child feel bereavement? A very young baby may not be capable of feeling the loss, but a slightly older child may feel it more than anyone else because his parents may be his whole world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
That is the case in a nutshell. It has been fully deployed in correspondence and in debates in another place and, I do not believe that it will be improved by repetition. I hope that I have explained it clearly. The onus is now upon those who maintain that there is a reason for excluding children from the range of beneficiaries. I do not believe that any process of logic will reinforce the case for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Ian Percival)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) that the problem cannot be dealt with as a matter of logic alone. Choices must be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that we were to abolish damages for loss of expectation of life and that a new head of damages should be introduced—I do not believe that anyone would quarrel with those assumptions—the Government had to choose from three courses of action. They could follow the Scottish system, the recommendations of the Law Commission or those of the Pearson Committee, which sought a middle way. Deciding which was preferable was a matter not of logic but of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked why damages should not be awarded to a child and why should they not be awarded at large. Such damages are intended to assuage grief. The provision is an experiment, because some people say—I see the force of the argument—that grief cannot be assuaged by money. They argue that to try so to assuage grief is immediately to enter difficult country. However, the Government decided to try to arrive at a satisfactory head of damages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The awarding of such damages to children would not make sense. There may be something in the argument put forward by the commissions that the grief of a person's wife, husband or parent may be assuaged in part if the party responsible for his or her death is ordered to pay damages. However, the argument does not run with children. One cannot measure even hypothetically, a child's grief. Does the likelihood of grief vary with a child's age? Furthermore, unless we introduced another wholly new principle, we should not assuage a child's grief by awarding damages, because the sum awarded would be paid into court and managed until he became an adult. For those reasons, we do not believe that it would be appropriate in such cases to award damages to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of whether one should have damages at large or the conventional sum, the argument is short but none the worse for that. If one had damages at large, each case would have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. That would necessarily involve examining how much grief there was in each instance. That is an unattractive proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view is that—I accept that it is a matter of judgment rather than logic—it is better to have a conventional sum of a reasonable figure, not a derisory one, which will be paid regardless of the particular circumstances of a family. That will avoid examining the family's circumstances. The chosen sum is that recommended by the Law Commission of £1,000 in 1973, uprated to take account of changes. That is around the figure that the Pearson Committee recommended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the Government's reasons for choosing that course. I do not claim that they are conclusive in logic or on any other basis. That is the Government's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
judgment on those two points and it has the full support of the Law Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Solicitor-General appears to have deployed two arguments. First, if damages for bereavement are intended to assuage grief, a child's grief will not be assuaged because he does not understand the concept of money. As I understand it, the purpose is not to assuage grief but to compensate for it. I believe that there is a difference. We could not assuage grief by an award of damages. Therefore, that would be a wholly pointless exercise. I believe that we should be trying to recognise that some compensation for grief should be offered. That being so, I do not understand why a child should be excluded. The child's grief will be just as real, and in many instances more so, than that of an adult. We are discussing minors—children up to the age of majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other argument is much more difficult. If we have a conventional figure that is fixed regardless of the number of claimants, it will diminish to a ridiculous level if there are too many claimants. Therefore, we cannot divorce this debate from subsequent debates on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to Mr. Solicitor-General for deploying the arguments that he will use in relation to the next group of amendments. It would be out of order if I attempted to reply to his arguments and I am therefore prepared to leave the matter at present. In the circumstances, I believe that it would be right to withdraw the amendment until we find out how the Committee feels in the next debate and return to the matter later in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 4, leave out lines 18 to 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 3, in page 4, leave out lines 27 to 31.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have of course read the recommendations of both the Law Commission and the Pearson committee. I accept that to some extent it is a matter of gut reaction and I doubt whether logical arguments will be of much help in convincing one another. However, I am bound to say that I have not been persuaded by what was said by those distinguished bodies; although I am pleased to have their consideration of the matter. Neither was I persuaded by what was said in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we cannot approach the problem by asking a hypothetical question "What sum would a reasonable person agree to accept in exchange for agreeing in advance to his loss?". That cannot be a possible approach over a whole range of subjects with which the courts are confronted daily. One cannot ask what sum would be accepted by a reasonable person for the loss of an eye in a factory or road accident. I accept that the matter cannot be approached in that way. However, it should not follow that one cannot ask any questions at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every day the courts assess damages for injuries which cannot be measured financially and which clearly have no market value as one cannot do a deal about them. They give damages for pain and suffering and for loss of amenities of life. It is also true that no damages could ever adequately compensate for the loss of a member of one's family. That does not seem to be a good reason for fixing upon—if it has to be a conventional one—a low conventional figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would we begin to explain to a non-lawyer that, because the loss that has been suffered is beyond all compensation, the compensation that is awarded should be substantially less than would be awarded for a much less serious injury? Those who have suffered the loss will not be thinking first of the damages which they may recover. But it does not follow that it is wrong or undignified to turn grief into money. If we recognise that there is to be compensation for bereavement, it ought at least to be commensurate with the bereavement. I would find it easier to swallow if the conventional figure were substantially higher—if it bore some relation to the scale of damages for all the other injuries which one individual can inflict upon another or to the scale for the loss of an eye or an arm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer the courts to approach each case on its merits. There are some questions that one cannot ask. There cannot be a scale of how much grief has been felt. However, certain questions can be asked: what are the circumstances, what other relatives are there to offer consolation, how far will the person involved be left completely alone and to what extent will he be deprived not only of the society and the companionship of the victim but be reliant on a total stranger for ordinary personal services? The courts ask such questions from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully agree with Mr. Solicitor-General that we probably are not going to convince each other by any process of logic, but I felt it right to deploy that case for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately linked the main point of the Government's argument on this amendment with what I was saying on amendment No. 1. They go together as packages. The right hon. and learned Gentleman puts forward one package and I am putting forward another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat what I said then; I just add this. The right hon. and learned Gentleman rightly said that the courts already have the difficult task of putting a price on something that has no price. That is bad enough when one is dealing with personal injuries where there is often an inquiry into whether the alleged pain and suffering is genuine. Can we really contemplate extending that into the field of grief? Can we really contemplate having to say as the representative of the defendant that the grief is not genuine—to say "They were at each other like cats and dogs for years". The Government believe that we should not introduce any new head of damages that would lead to that kind of inquiry—one which might result in awful squabbles over grief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing damages for grief. I see an argument that it is a head of damages that should not exist, but I also see the argument that it is one that we should try. However, I simply could not stomach extending it to a head of damages under which the parties will be open
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to inquiries as to whether the grief is genuine. The Government's view, in line with that of the Law Commission and with the majority of the Pearson Committee, is that if one is going to compensate one must take a reasonable round figure and then forget that in some cases it might be compensation for grief that was not actually felt. That risk has to be taken. However, one cannot say that grief is beyond price and that a high figure must therefore be put upon it, because some people may, indeed receive money to which they are not entitled. We are assisted in trying to strike a balance by the views on appropriate sums expressed by the Law Commission and in the Pearson report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do not let us enter into the inquiries to which the amendment would lead. Let us give the provision a fair run and see how it works, in the hope that it will be of some comfort to people who lose a husband, wife or child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the argument deployed by Mr. Solicitor-General and accept that there are two opinions on the matter. However, we still hold our view, and I shall mark that by advising my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment. It will at least help to have the view of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

General for Scotland and myself. I had looked forward to hearing the Solicitor-General on the subject of the civil law of Scotland but that pleasure will clearly be denied to us. We shall have to make do with his Scottish counterpart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General for Scotland has become an itinerant among Scottish Ministers, a hermit crab of politics cropping up in all sorts of unexpected places. He is usually added to Committees suddenly and not as a bona fide member. However, I am glad to see that he is here in his own right as a member of the Committee. He, like me, will no doubt have to sit through all the debates on new clauses relating to England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that this will be something of a Scottish debate, because the Bill is a hybrid. Although it deals largely with law reform in England and Wales, some of its provisions relate peculiarly to Scotland and are of real importance and interest for Scottish law. Proper consideration of such hybrid Bills is extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise, but it is worth noting that no Scottish Member, and therefore no one with a special incentive to deal with Scottish matters, sat on the Second Reading Committee. The reference by the Solicitor-General to the Scottish part of the Bill occupies 12 lines in c. 6 of the 	<i>Official Report.</i> It was a mere nod to the existence of provisions for Scotland. No attempt was made to argue the case for the drafting of the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made those preliminary remarks because some amendments, of which No. 47 is a good example, raise general points of principle concerning part II of the Bill which could usefully have been aired on Second Reading. I have outlined the reasons why they were not. I hope that the Committee will bear with the fact that we have not hitherto had the opportunity of tabling these broad, probing amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are to clause 8, which deals with "Services rendered to injured person". No one suggests that the provision will ultimately be drafted as suggested in the amendments. However, the intention is to substitute "third party" for the key limiting word "relative". There has been much debate by correspondence—a theme running through many of the amendments— between the Law Society of Scotland and the Solicitor General's Department about changes that the society wishes to see. This amendment, like many others, is based upon the views of the Law Society, which I share in this particular at least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us start not with Pearson, for once, but with the Scottish Law Commission's 1978 report entitled "Damages for Personal Injuries Report on (1) Admissibility of Claims for Services (2) Admissible Deductions". We shall come to the admissible deductions later. Paragraph 20 on page 9 of that report sets out the basic argument behind the limitation of the provision to relatives. Although it may seem presumptuous to criticise the reasoning of the Law Commission, on some occasions one must screw up one's courage and be presumptuous. I find the argument in paragraph 20 extremely unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that we must all try to be pragmatic and it seems that the Committee started with a prejudice. It had decided that it wished to limit to relatives the head of claim relating to services rendered to injured persons. Paragraph 20gave me the impressionthat the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
had set out to find arguments to justify the conclusion that it had to reach for reasons of expediency. I do not necessarily mean that pejoratively—perhaps "convenience" is the better word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The admission in the paragraph is most helpful to my argument:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While such a restriction"— </p></blockquote>
that is to relatives—
	<br><blockquote><p>"might lead to anomalies between the treatment of persons rendering identical services, one of whom is within the family group and the other without it, in the absence of such a restriction the class of persons whose services must be taken into account might include, according to the circumstances, such bodies as hospitals, ambulance services, the police and fire service."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to spoil that point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would, no doubt, be possible in the relevant legislation to allow only private individuals to present claims."</p></blockquote>
The fact that that would, indeed, be possible, seems largely to take out the earlier argument. A contorted argument follows, in which the Commission seeks a moral basis for limiting the head of claim to services offered by a relative as distinct from someone else:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Services rendered by persons within the family group are often motivated by a high sense of duty, and in order to render them members of the family may be prepared to make considerable sacrifices, including leaving their employment."</p></blockquote>
I have no doubt that that is true. Often members of the family are
	<br><blockquote><p>"motivated by a high sense of duty".</p></blockquote>
The report then goes on to belittle that "high sense of duty" by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But they may expect, in the long run, to receive some benefit as a counterpart, though not necessarily a benefit of a tangible nature."</p></blockquote>
I am not clear what the benefit would be if it is not "of a tangible nature." I suppose that it may be the love and affection of the husband. However, that is taking the argument into a very difficult area in which to weigh the substance of the point. It is knocking copy to say that the unfortunate relative is
	<br><blockquote><p>"often motivated by a high sense of duty"</p></blockquote>
but is really doing it because he expects something in return—even if that something is not "tangible."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continues and states that the unfortunate person who has rendered the service which may be the subject of the head of claim but who is outside the family is doing that service:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a spirit of disinterested philanthropy without any prospect or even thought of benefits in counterpart."</p></blockquote>
There is the unlikely distinction that a wife is seen as some sort of cunning vixen and when she gives up her job to nurse her husband it is because she expects something in return; when a non-relative does that, it is because of some good Samaritan act without any expectation of return, and the law should therefore see that they do not get anything in return. That is an immoral argument that smacks of remarkable experiences. It runs counter to arguments used by the Law Commission in respect of clause 9, and I find the argument remarkably unimpressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that that does not square with what Pearson said. I do not want to weary the Committee and outstay my welcome. We remember paragraph 344 of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Pearson report with its quotation from the case of Donnelly v Joyce. I shall quote briefly from paragraph 346, which concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would not ourselves wish to exclude the recovery of damages in respect of services rendered gratuitously by someone outside the victim's family group. On the approach in Donnelly v. Joyce the damages are awarded for the plaintiff's need to have services rendered to him. It seems to us that this need is not different in character if it is met by a friend rather than a member of the family."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right. There can be no doubt that all the attempts to meet that moral distinction are based on shifting sands and I do not believe that they can be seriously maintained. The Minister will know that the Law Society of Scotland has been hammering at his door and has sent a memorandum with regard to part II of the Bill which has been fairly widely circulated. If the Minister reads from the top of page 4 he will see that, again, quoting from the approach in the case of Donnelly v Joyce:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the damages are awarded for the plaintiff's need to have services rendered to him. It seems to us that this need is not different in character if it is met by a friend rather than a member of the family."</p></blockquote>
That is a quotation from paragraph 346 in the Pearson report, as mentioned previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society continues—this is its own view—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The committee strongly supports this proposal and can see no good reason for the limitation of the award to the cost of a relative's services."</p></blockquote>
We shall come to later what might be called part of the whole, because I have proposed amendments that I hope will receive a sympathetic reception on the position of cohabitees. Leaving that matter to one side at present, and with regard to the general principle laid out in this amendment, I believe that it was right that that fact should go down, particularly as there was no explanation in the Second Reading debate for reasons which I fully understand and do not criticise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should ask the Solicitor-General to explain the Law Society's reasoning and whether he endorses it. Why was what appears to be the evident equity of a broader definition of a person giving services in regard to clause 8 not adapted when the clause was drafted in the inner recesses of the Scottish Office?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sets out briefly the arguments as I see them. Will the Solicitor-General say a word or two? We can then take the matter from there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Peter Fraser)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The report of the Scottish Law Commission, No. 51, to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred, was first published in April 1978. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the second page, he will note who the commissioners were. One was Mr. J. P. H. Mackay QC, who is now the Lord Advocate. So in this particular matter I step cautiously into the provisions and proposals put forward by the Scottish Law Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it is not the hon. Gentleman's intention, but if his amendment, as drafted, were to be accepted, it would mean that persons, such as nurses, ambulance men and firemen would have to be taken into account. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is not concerned with that but with a broader point of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
principle and with the difference between the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission and the Pearson commission. The latter reached different conclusions about what should be done about the class of persons who might be entitled to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was unfair of the hon. Gentleman to say that the Scottish Law Commission started with a prejudice. The paragraph to which he refers states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This was the point we did not make in our memorandum but it is one which was forcefully made to us in consultation".</p></blockquote>
Far from starting with a prejudice, it began with an open mind, and, consequent upon consultations in Scotland, it reached a view that the matter should be restricted to the family circle and not extended beyond it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has in some detail gone through the discrepancies and the falseness in the argument concerning the moral performance of the duties between members of the family and others. However, the Law Commission is really saying in the report, which has been accepted by the Government, that the occasions when persons outside the family group render such services are less frequent and less readily foreseeable. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our view it is only within the family group that there is a demonstrable social need to allow recovery in respect of services rendered".</p></blockquote>
It is worth emphasising that where services are rendered by persons outside the family group, and if an arrangement is made that those services should be performed for a reward, the money would be recoverable under the ordinary claim for damages. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman understands that. But, it is worth emphasising that the only area which would not give rise to a claim for damages would be gratuitous services rendered by someone outwith the family group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little point in elaborating on that distinction which the Scottish Law Commission made and which we are all aware is a matter on which the Pearson commission took a different approach. I am aware that the Law Society of Scotland strongly urged that we should follow the advice of the Pearson commission. However the Pearson commission's representation further argues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any event, the committee are not sure why the definition of "relative" cannot be extended to include a common law wife or co-habitee".</p></blockquote>
Without going into points that I wish to make on later amendments, I can give the hon. Gentleman a broad hint that that extension is to receive a far more favourable consideration than the wider extension just to third party provided for in his amendment. Therefore, I ask him to withdraw the amendment. I do not offer to give him all that he wants, but as we shall be considering the question of cohabitees, and for the broad reasons put forward by the Scottish Law Commission following the consultation in Scotland, the provision should be left as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that the debate has taken us much further, but perhaps that was predictable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not really understand the moral justification for the distinction. Many lay people—I am certainly one
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
when it comes to the intricacies of the law of damages— would say that there was a duty upon a member of the family to be disinterested and not to expect reward for doing what is seen as a family duty. When the Law Commission argued foreseeability as a justification for certain changes, for example, under clause 9, it found very strongly on the family unit concept of the duty within that unit. It is strange that the Law Commission is now taking this very artificial definition of reward in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in so many other arguments on this Bill, we shall just have to disagree. We would not get very far and we would probably outstay our welcome if we had a long argument about it. I note that the Minister is offering the prospect of goodies later in our exchanges, and I shall have to be satisfied with that. I cannot say that I have been swept away by his eloquence or that a blinding flash of intuition has come to me as a result of his efforts. But I can see that he will not give way, and it would probably be better if we cut the cackle. I shall hold myself in suspense until I see what is on offer later, and I may have to return to the matter after I have seen how generous or otherwise the Solicitor-General for Scotland can be. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This again is a probing amendment, but it concerns a more specific point which is of some interest. It is certainly of interest to me, because when I read the clause, many points made me think "What the hell does this mean?".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will now have an opportunity to explain precisely what is meant by clause 8(1). It provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where necessary services have been rendered to an injured person by a relative in consequence of the injuries in question … the responsible person shall be liable to pay".</p></blockquote>
The important qualifying phrase, which amendment No. 48 would excise, is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"then, unless the relative has expressly agreed that no payment should be made in respect of those services".</p></blockquote>
I wish to replace those words with others from the Law Society about which there has been considerable correspondence. The amendment would add at the bottom of subsection (1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that no award shall be made under this section if the Court is satisfied that the relative is unwilling to accept payment for the services rendered."</p></blockquote>
One can argue about which is the better form of words. It may be easiest if I ask the Minister some fairly obvious questions. Once we know exactly what is in the ministerial mind, we can judge better which of the two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
forms of words achieves it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know exactly how it will work. There are many legislative examples of waivers. Those hon. Members who served on the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill will remember the many hours of debate about forms of waiver, the circumstances in which a waiver was binding and when it could be revoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister could state when he expects the express agreement that no payment should be made will occur and in what form. Presumably it could be either oral or written. Is the express agreement that there will be no payment made at the time that services are rendered or during the course of the action? If, for example, the aunt of the injured party gives up her job because she has a strong sense of family duty and there is no one to look after her nephew who has been horribly injured, I presume that she has no thought at that stage about reward or compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that, because of her loss of wages over a considerable time, there is a substantial head of claim. Counsel for the defendant might get her into the witness box and extract from her the admirably honest opinion that, at the time that she acted and throughout the period, she did not expect or want anything; she did what she did because she genuinely liked her nephew and if he had offered her his own money she would have refused and said "Certainly not, we stick together in this family through thick and thin".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that evidence sufficient to establish that there was an express agreement that there would be no payment for services? Let us suppose that that conversation took place, but that subsequently, as often happens when the pain and injury have been mastered, legal action for damages or compensation is considered. At that stage, people might say to the aunt "You might as well put in a claim. I know that you said that you did not want anything, but you might as well claim as you may be able to get something for your loss of wages". Is that sufficient to revoke what may be a fairly express understanding between the parties? There would be no compensation if that had to be found from the injured party's own resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are fairly self-evident points, but the Minister might wish to comment on them. I found paragraph 28 of the Scottish Law Commission's report, "Damages for Personal Injuries", a little opaque. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some commentators, while welcoming the general principle…questioned whether the introduction of a presumption that the services had not been rendered gratuitously was the appropriate device.…On reconsidering this question we are persuaded that this point has considerable force, and that the presumption against gratuity may in practice be easily displaced. There is a possibility that, even if all the other conditions as to recovery of damages are satisfied, the relative may admit under cross-examination that he did not contemplate remuneration at the time when he rendered the services."</p></blockquote>
That is the scene that I have been outlining.
	<br><blockquote><p>"If these other conditions are satisfied it does not seem right to permit recovery of damages only if, in effect, the parties had actually contemplated remuneration."</p></blockquote>
That paragraph raises a number of problems. It may be my fault, but I had great difficulty understanding what the Scottish Law Commission was recommending.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
It gave some specific proposals in paragraph 31, which do not seem to have found favour and perhaps the Minister will explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have other help, which I should mention in passing. One of the Minister's civil servants, a Mr. N. E. Sharp, wrote to the Law Society of Scotland on 21 June on exactly those points. The Minister may have that letter in front of him now. It states that an agreement might be given
	<br><blockquote><p>"at any time after the accident and expressed orally or in writing."</p></blockquote>
I should like to make it clear that that is the Minister's position. Although I may appear to answer my own questions as I go along, I feel that it is worth putting them on the record, as not everyone will have access to the correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Sharp continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The view of the Scottish Law Commission was that the existence of such an agreement should be treated as a question of fact and there is force in this view."</p></blockquote>
But I am not sure that saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is force in this view"</p></blockquote>
is quite the same as saying that it is the Government's view. It merely implies that the point may reasonably be argued. It does not give the imprimatur of the Solicitor-General's professional opinion, of which no doubt we shall have the benefit in a minute or two. The letter goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proviso to clause 8(1) suggested in your comments is not really satisfactory insofar as it might encourage a defender to seek to persuade a relative in court that he had not wished or expected any remuneration. There is a significant difference between an admission that the relative did not expect payment for services rendered and an admission that there exists an expressed agreement to waive payment."</p></blockquote>
The Minister's adviser appears to say that a relative can be put into the box to say that he refused payment. I cannot imagine a more positive waiver—to use laymen's language—than "I was offered the money and I refused it". But the Minister has implied that it is not enough that there is no expectation, and perhaps even a positive refusal, of payment at some stage before the action is raised. Presumably, there would have to be a statement later in terms of the action that no payment was expected and that any right to it was being specifically waived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Sharp has made an interesting and important distinction. I should like the Minister to make it absolutely clear that that is how he sees the system operating. I am not sure that the phrase in the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the relative has expressly agreed that no payment should be made in respect of those services"—</p></blockquote>
fully conveys the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the matter of tenses is of some interest, "as expressly agreed" suggests a past tense. "Expressly agrees" might suggest that the important issue is not the relative's state of mind when the services were rendered, but his state of. mind at the time when the action is current in court. The words "expressly agrees" might make the position clearer than "as expressly agreed", if I am right in my assumption that the provision is a legal waiver, a specific refusal of the right to claim at the time when the action was raised by the injured party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Let me finally ask the Minister about the Law Society's recommendations. I. find the society's argument rather hard to follow at times. Paragraph 31 of the recommendations states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A simpler and broader solution to the problem would seem to be called for, which at the same time adequately protected the interest of the relative."</p></blockquote>
The society suggests that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the injured person should not be able to make a competent claim under this head unless he lodges in process a statement which specifies the services and is signed by the relative. Such a formality should not be required unless and until an action of damages is raised."</p></blockquote>
I am not prejudiced one way or the other by the fact that the then Mr. J. P. H. Mackay was one of the Law Commissioners when the report was pursued. But I am attracted by the idea of that solution being embodied in the statute in one form or another, or in a practice rule. It would then be clear that there is no virtue in examining the state of mind of the person who rendered the service, and no point even in establishing that at that time he was rejecting remuneration for his services. The important point would be that when the action had been raised and the heads of claim were formulated, there was a wish to claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could be illustrated by the fact that the heads of claim had to be signed where the particular loss was formulated. It would clarify the situation and be an easily administered and easily understood procedure. It is not included in the words that I am trying to take out of the Bill. To be fair, the Solicitor-General may say "Neither is it in the words that I am trying to put in." I admit that, but for the purposes of the debate I think that I am entitled at least to urge it on him. It is a matter of some importance and the amendment is of potential help in clarifying what is, on the face of it, an obscure and opaque situation</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not persuaded that the words that the hon. Gentleman has tabled as an alternative do anything to eliminate the difficulty. In my view, amendment No. 49, if adopted, would, far from improving matters, make them much worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not looking at the same letter as the hon. Gentleman, but a number of representations have been made to the Government. It is envisaged that the clause as drafted would allow the claim to be defeated only where there was an express agreement that no payment should be made in respect of the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a matter for the defender—or, in the terminology that we are using here—the responsible person to establish. As the hon. Gentleman appreciates, the agreement could be either oral or written, and might be given at any time after the Bill is enacted. The important point is that it would be for the defender or responsible person to establish that. The hon. Gentleman has quoted from a letter that precisely summarises the situation. The wife, for example, might say in the witness box "Yes, I have looked after my husband throughout his illness. I gave up my job. I did not have in the forefront of my mind any prospect that I might be remunerated for doing that". That is one thing. In those circumstances her husband would still be entitled
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
to make a claim under clause 8. There is a significant difference between that and when there is an agreement between husband and wife, either in writing or by an orally expressed admission in the witness box, that she should receive no payment for that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Gentleman to examine the words that he suggests. I appreciate that he has taken them from the Law Society, but the wording adopted in the Bill, which is the same as in the Scottish Law Commission's draft Bill, is inserted precisely to prevent the court being required to examine the relative's attitude. If the amendment were adopted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"no award shall be made under this section if the Court is satisfied that the relative is unwilling to accept payment for the services rendered"—</p></blockquote>
before the court could contemplate making an award, it would be bound to subject that witness to examination and cross-examination. All that would be required would be for the relative to say that she was unwilling to accept payment. The hon. Gentleman has a long experience in courts. 1 am sure that he can imagine how he would conduct a cross-examination to extract from a wife that she was unwilling to accept payment, by embarrassing her into saying that of course she did this out of love, favour and affection for her husband, and not out of any mercenary desire to receive payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even for a cross-examiner less good than the hon. Gentleman it would not be difficult to set about a cross-examination which could get an unfortunate wife into a position where she said "I am not really concerned about receiving payment for this." Once she had said that, it would not be a large step to extracting a concession that she was unwilling to accept payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, I am saying to the hon. Gentleman and, through him, the Law Society, that while their concern is understood, our view is that the very problem to which they have pointed is made that much worse by the amendment, and that their fears about the wording in clause 8 are substantially unfounded. It would be only in a matter of express agreement that the claim would be excluded and the onus of establishing that express agreement would be incumbent upon the person responsible for the defendant. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that he can withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can withdraw it, but I think that 1 should press the Minister a little further before I do. I follow his argument on the words in amendment No. 49. and I am not thirled to that at all. 1 agree that arguably it does not meet the point upon which my argument is based, but the point remains reasonably good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has chosen his ground with his usual skill by assuming that one is considering a husband and wife. I can understand that if a wife is looking after her husband, it is extremely unlikely that at an early stage, when services are being rendered, there will be any discussion about remuneration, because a family or a pooled income is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the unfortunate wife has to give up her job to nurse the injured husband, they will both suffer because the family income will be diminished by that amount. If
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the husband pays the wife compensation for her loss of earnings, it becomes, in the worst and most narrow sense, a book-keeping entry for the family as a unit. It therefore seems extremely unlikely that there will be any discussion about payment to the wife for her services. There may have to be some reallocation of the diminished family resources to cover household expenses. The wife may have met many household expenses out of her earnings, which will now have to be met out of what is left from the unfortunate husband's reduced earnings if he is laid up and being nursed and her earnings are reduced because she has given up her job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compensation will not be in terms of "I'll compensate you, my dear, for this Florence Nightingale act that you are performing at my bedside." However, in my example of an aunt and a bachelor nephew, if the aunt gives up work, there might be a real and meaningful discussion along the lines of "You come and nurse me, but really, Auntie, I must compensate you for that, and I am prepared to dip into capital to do so." At that stage the aunt says "Oh no. certainly not. I am not going to take any payment. It will be for only six months and I can manage. You have been so kind to me in the past in this way and that, so I shall do without." In that situation it is likely that financial arrangements will be discussed and there may be a specific waiver by the aunt of an offer of payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that arrangement came to court and subsequently an action was raised, and using clause 8 a head of claim was included for the aunt's losses and it came to light when the aunt was put into the box, would that be considered to be a specific waiver? I think that it would be bound to be. Would it not, therefore, be much better to change the wording to make it clear that it is the mental state of the person rendering the service as regards compensation at the time that the head of claim is being formulated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then come to paragraph 31. The Minister did not mention it, although I specifically asked him about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have shortened it unnecessarily, but my point was that, although paragraph 31 suggests a broader but simpler solution to the problem, the Scottish Law Commission, in the Bill which it prepared itself, chose the precise formulation that we used in the Bill. Although it examined the broader and simpler solution, at the end of the day it chose the alternative approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger of going on for too long, but that is not a satisfactory reason for just not mentioning it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 31 and in the recommendations in paragraph 33, the Scottish Law Commission sticks to my proposal. I am not an expert on draftsmanship, but the proposal could be seen as a mechanistic device which could be included, despite the wording of the Bill. If it is not, it is not clear why the Scottish Law Commission decided to depart from it, as it seems to make eminently sound sense. The Minister should consider whether it would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland has also made the point that there are problems about someone knowing that a head of claim is being formulated based on his loss of earnings. The person who lost the service and whose loss is the basis of the head is not a party to the action. If he
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
were called in to sign the head of claim, that would have the added attraction not only of ruling out the inquiry into the state of mind at an earlier stage and basing it simply on the state of mind at the time that the action was raised; it would ensure that the action was raised including a head of claim based on the person's loss. That additional advantage has been canvassed by several parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General for Scotland should say a little more before I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the Minister said. We should preclude as much as possible the time-wasting and difficult exercise of looking back at the state of mind of the parties. The form of words used may not be mine, although that at least ties it to the present as it says "the relative is unwilling", whatever the person felt in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is virtue in that approach. Some move should be made towards that so that we do not have any dickering about or awkward cross-examination about a person's state of mind when he moved into the house to become the temporary housekeeper during the illness and so on. The present wording does not achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is looking impatiently, but I think that the point is plausible and, as it has been canvassed, I have a duty to canvass it with the Minister and he has a duty to tell me why he finds me so aggravating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the matter tied to the time of the action and not wandering back to the difficult, indeterminate moral approaches of witnesses. We should exclude the case of the aunt which I outlined. The Solicitor-General for Scotland should give us a little more information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of being aggravated. 1 just do not take from paragraph 31 what the hon. Gentleman has taken from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 30 of the report the Scottish Law Commission is concerned about the mechanics of ensuring that the person who has rendered the services will, once the head of claim has been admitted, be protected and will receive the amount of damages recovered on his or her behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 30 suggests a machinery to allow for
	<br><blockquote><p>"a direct remittance by the 'wrongdoer' to the person rendering the services."</p></blockquote>
That approach is discussed in detail and several problems are pointed out. When the commission discusses
	<br><blockquote><p>"A simpler and broader solution to the problem"</p></blockquote>
I believe that it refers to paragraph 30 not paragraph 28, with which the amendment is concerned. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A simpler and broader solution to the problem would seem to be called for, which at the same time adequately protected the interest of the relative. We consider that, in any proceedings, the injured person should not be able to make a competent claim under this head"—</p></blockquote>
a separate claim—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless he lodges in process a statement which specifies the services and is signed by the relative. Such a formality should not be required unless and until an action of damages is raised. This approach would have the advantages of diminishing the chance of spurious claims by injured persons and of alerting the relative to his right of reimbursement."</p></blockquote>
I do not see how that is directly related to the point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
raised in the hon. Gentleman's amendment. When we consider the Scottish courts and rules of court, that issue will have to be discussed. But it is separate from the issues raised by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I shall have to be satisfied with that reply. I see the Solicitor-General for Scotland's point that I am taking a narrow argument about the rights of the person who renders service and his protection. An additional advantage of the solution in a paragraph 31 was that it meant that that person was aware of what was going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Solicitor-General for Scotland is right, or whether I am, that mechanism has advantages because it specifies the point at which the state of mind of the person who renders services is relevant. That is the main argument between us. He has not dealt with that. He could have dealt with it in the aunt case that I referred to and said whether he thought that that would be a waiver and would rule out the claim. If he deals with it we could move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the possibly varying views of the relative that are relevant. He will often not even think about the matter until he is told that he or the injured party may have a legal claim. Surely that is not when there should be a specific waiver. It is when it is known that the insurance company may have to pay that the state of mind of the person should be judged. That might mean that in almost every case the claim would go ahead. That is the equitable intention of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the relative stated a claim, that would seem to exclude the existence of an express agreement to waive the right to payment. If such a document existed, the burden of proof incumbent upon the responsible person or defender would be such that there would be no point in trying to leave that person in evidence, which is what we are seeking to avoid, and establishing that there was such express agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the points made by the hon. Gentleman, but he seems to see them in greater size and substance than I believe will be the case. The term "expressly agreed" would ensure that a claim would be excluded only in such circumstances. That is a proper view, but it would be for the defender or responsible person to establish that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it there. Perhaps we shall think about it before Report, although I hope that that does not sound like a threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a danger that Opposition Members can get out of proportion points brought to their attention or on which they stumble. I presume that the waiver is irrevocable and that once it has been made the person who gave it cannot say "Oh, but on discovering a legal right of redress, I have changed my mind." That is important because there may be injustices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person in the box may say that he gave a waiver because he thought that it was coming out of the injured party's pocket, but that had he known that because the injury was caused by negligence it was covered by an insurance company, he would never have
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
given the waiver. That is an injustice which we should at least reconsider before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am anxious not to outstay my welcome, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 8, line 25, at end insert—

This is a tidying up amendment, but a reasonably important one. Clause 9 contains a specific provision to cover the question of a death. Clause 8 contains no such provision. I am informed by the Scottish Home and Health Department in a letter to which I referred that it is expected that any claim for services rendered to the injured party will, on the death of the injured party, fall to his executor to pursue under section 2 of the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear that that will be the effect of the clause, and this clumsy layman's narative is to draw attention to that.

I should like to examine further the question of the transmission of claims in the event of an intervening death. There is certainly no difference between us in principle, and I think that we are agreed that the executor should be able to recover the cost of a relative's service. But I must consider whether the proper amendment should involve section 2(1) of the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976, or whether that section, as it is now in force, is sufficient to cover both clauses 8 and 9.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
quickly. It may be that I am over-cautious in my approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister satisfied with the clause? It is clear from the rubric and from what everyone knows about the clause that we are considering services to an injured person's relative. It involves a strange concept: if a person is unable to give a service to a relative which he would normally give, he should be compensated for the loss that he suffers because of that. The Scottish Law Commission set out a complicated and convoluted argument in paragraph 38 in which it explained why that is not a loss to the relative who is not given the service but to the person who wished to give the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important part of the clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The responsible person shall be liable to pay to the injured person …a reasonable sum by way of damages in respect of his inability to render the personal services referred to in subsection (3) below".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The personal services referred to in subsections (1) and (2) above are personal services—
	<ol>
	<li>which were or might have been expected to have been rendered by the injured person before the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to liability,</li>
	<li>of a kind which, when rendered by a person other than a relative, would ordinarily be obtainable on payment, and</li>
	<li>which the injured person but for the injuries in question might have been expected to render gratuitously to a relative".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is the main executive power of the clause. As it stands, the clause does not make clear what is clear in the rubric: the clause concerns services to a person's relative. It is self-evident to anyone who knows the law, because we know what we are about and the recommendations on which the clause is based. Subsection (4) hints that the clause concerns relatives when it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (2) above, the relative shall have no direct right of action in delict".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps we should make the text clearer. I do not expect the Minister to say much about that. I may be making a song and dance about nothing. However, on first reading the text it is not clear that the provisions are confined to a relative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is probably fairly self-evident, too, but I should like the Minister to comment on it. The Law Commission reckons that the action is allowable because the loss is to the injured party who was expecting some sort of return for the services that he would have given to a relative. He cannot give the services; therefore he will not get the return which is presumably love, favour, affection, connubial bliss or whatever. Therefore, the person who would have given the return will in pique not give that return because the services have not in the first place been given, and the injured party suffers a loss for which he should claim compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument is extraordinary and departs from the theory of Scottish law, which is that the claimant must suffer loss. Be that as it may, if, for example, a wife is injured and a daughter gives up her work to nurse her mother, the injured wife can claim under clause 8 for her daughter's loss of earnings. That is as plain as a pikestaff. There would be an action under clause 9, also by the wife, on the grounds that she would have offered housewifely duties to the daughter living at home but cannot do so and, therefore, does not receive her
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
daughter's full love and affection, which would have been the counterpart to those duties. Therefore, the wife would be entitled to an action under clause 9 for the loss of her right to give the services to her daughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two rights, one under clause 8 and another under clause 9, open to the injured wife on the loss of the daughter who has had to give up her earnings and so on to be her nurse, and a straight action, which has nothing to do with the daughter except indirectly, on the basis of the inability of the wife to give services to the daughter. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that in those circumstances, which are quite common, there could be an action under clause 8 and clause 9. Will he explain exactly how they are set off ahead of each other?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems somewhat incongruous and I find it rather difficult to understand those heads. I can see how the first could be quantified, but perhaps the Minister will say a word about how the second would be quantified and whether it would be set off against the first or whether both would stand separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to the first point, I take the hon. Gentleman back to clause 9(3) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The personal services referred to in subsections (1) and (2) above are personal services—
	<ol>
	<li>which were…giving rise to liability,</li>
	<li>of a kind which, when rendered by a person other than a relative, would ordinarily be obtainable on payment, and</li>
	<li>which…might have been expected to render gratuitously to a relative."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
If they are all accumulative, I should have thought that "relative" makes it clear that the whole relates to a relative. I shall re-examine the matter, but I do not see the difficulty perceived by the hon. Gentlemen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little anxious about the possibility of getting involved in speculation about a wide variety of different sets of circumstances that might arise in the event of injury to one member of a family. However, as I understand the particular example cited by the hon. Gentleman of a daughter giving up her job to look after her injured mother, in those circumstances the claim under clause 8 would arise. It is possible to envisage circumstances in which that mother had in the past rendered services to the daughter and was unable to render them further, and it seems clear that a claim would arise under clause 9. It may clarify matters to say that it might be that the wife was no longer in a position to render services to her husband. Clearly, in those circumstances there could also be a claim under clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not have thought that in principle there was anything to prevent a reciprocal rendering of services being covered between clauses 8 and 9. However, I am not entirely sure what the hon. Gentleman means by the rights of settle in this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we do not want to go too far into that and perhaps we may correspond about the point, if I have the energy to get round to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Solicitor-General that in the scenario that I have outlined, which is not outlandish but very likely when it is the daughter who has to give up her job rather than the husband giving up his to nurse the injured wife, the head of claim under clause 8 is easily formulated. I see no difficulty about that, but in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
second example of the clause 9 claim by the wife on the basis of being unable to render the services that she is accustomed to render to the daughter, presumably those would be housekeeping services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The daughter lives at home, the housewife is now injured and cannot make beds or tea or have the kettle on when the daughter comes home from work and so on. One might argue that the theory of the clause 9 claim is that there is a countervailing benefit from the services that have been given. That countervailing benefit is, presumably, a contribution to the housekeeping expenses from the daughter's salary, but the daughter is no longer working and is getting compensation under clause 8 because she is not working. Therefore, that would seem to extinguish the countervailing benefit and the claim under 9. Is it thought that that is not simply a financial counterpoint but an emotional one? If so, how would that be formulated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Solicitor-General to speculate on this and perhaps write to me, as 1 am anxious to save the Committee's time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlemen asks whether it is an emotional or affectionate service that is no longer being rendered. To answer that question, I refer him to clause 9(3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The personal services…	<i>(b) </i> of a kind which, when rendered by a person other than a relative, would ordinarily be obtainable on payment".</p></blockquote>
That makes it clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the basic example given by the hon. Gentleman is not wholly fanciful, it becomes extremely difficult in Committee to elaborate on it and to think of circumstances where claims may overlap or may be set off. Clearly there are a number of heads of claim and, because a person makes a claim under clause 8, a claim under clause 9 should not necessarily be excluded. The claimant must look to the definition of personal services in subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to follow the argument of the Solicitor-General for Scotland. The difficulty that I have experienced is the bad use of the English language in the clause. I know that it is generally thought that members of the Committee and of the House should not have anything to do with the drafting of the provisions, but I do not go along with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a good rule of syntax that the personal pronoun in a sentence refers to the subject of the sentence. In this clause it clearly does not, at least where it first appears and, I think, nowhere where it appears. As I understand it, the clause should read: "The responsible person shall be liable to pay to the injured person (or, where the injured person has died)". That is its meaning, is it not? The "he" in the second line of clause 9(1) refers to the injured person. The Solicitor-General for Scotland nods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot do that. It is quite improper use of language. The personal pronoun must refer to the subject, although if one reads the subsection three or four times one realises that it must refer to the object. So the law
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
will be clear on the matter, but it is not good English language because it must be read two or three times to get what is referred to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because parenthesis are used, I concede that it would be all right to say: "The responsible person shall be liable to pay to the injured person (or, where the injured person has died, to his executor)". One could just about get away with that, but not with the reference to "his" in line 4. As I understand the content, it refers again to the injured person, does it not? The Solicitor-General is nodding again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot do that. It is quite improper and confusing. If that is done, it means that people have to read the sentence two or three times to get what are is talking about. The person who knows what he is talking about knew to start with, although he read what he had written, of course, but anyone else must read it two or three times to achieve that. That must not happen again, or I shall put down admendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 9, line 19, leave out paragraph (c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a comparatively small amendment. It is the result of representations made by the Law Society of Scotland. Page 5 of its memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is submitted that the provisions of paragraph (c) would cause problems because it is not clearly stated to which benefits this provision will apply. The specific benefits in mind should be referred to,"</p></blockquote>
No doubt the Minister will say "We cannot do that because benefits are always changing and we might have to change the list every now and then when the Department of Health and Social Security bothers to reform the system." That may be true, but it would be helpful if he said something about the amendments and about what subparagraph 	<i>(c)</i> means. Supplementary benefit is the most obvious. I assume that family income supplement would be another. If he will say something about what the benefits are, we shall be in a better position to judge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subparagraph (c) would cover such payments as supplementary benefit or any other means-tested benefit such as family income supplement. The point of subparagraph (c) is to make it clear that the right to these benefits is to be excluded from consideration because the purpose of the benefits is to provide subsistence for persons for whom income from all sources is not sufficient to meet their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that unlike subparagraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b),</i> explicit reference is made to payments made to members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
of the injured person's family. This ensures that damages claimed for loss of earnings will not be modified because of the possibility of supplementary benefit being payable. However, this exclusion covers only the potential right to receive such benefit after the payment of damages. Any benefits received up to that date will be taken into account under clause 10 (3). That is an arrangement that broadly falls in line with the recommendations and views of the Pearson Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it might be simpler for practitioners to know exactly what benefits we are referring to. But it is the means testing and width of the arrangement made that are critical here. 1 am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that these matters change from time to time. I am reminded that a good example would be the proposed housing benefit that is to replace rent rebates. It is more prudent not to be specific but to leave the formulation set out in subparagraph (c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. We are talking here of all assessments of damages for personal injuries and getting away from the narrow heads of claims that we discussed under clauses 8 and 9. This is a more across-the-board principle for any action in Scottish courts. We are saying that under subparagraph 	<i>(c)</i> all these benefits will be taken into account up to the date of the award of damages, but not afterwards. I accept that that is what everyone recommends, and is what we do, although I have never been entirely sure why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of unified housing benefit. As he said, it is a replacement for rent rebate. If a person had a rent rebate—let us assume that it was granted before the award of damages—r assume that it would not be taken into account. Is that correct? I would not imagine that if a person was competing for damages and was awarded £5,000, the court would say, "Ah, but this person has had a rent rebate." Supplementary benefit would be taken into account, but not rent rebate. It would not be said that as the rent rebate was worth £6 or £7 per week—perhaps it would not be as much as that in Scotland—it had to be deducted from the damages. But is the Minister saying that unified housing benefit will be taken into account and deducted from the damages? I have not thought about this before and 1 may be quite off beam, but I should have thought that that would make a difference. It is an important side effect of the change from the rebate system of unified housing benefit that the one will be taken into account and docked from damages and the other will not. That would make a significant impact on a fairly modest settlement. Will the Minister confirm that I am right and, if so, is he happy about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation to go down that road. When referring to the housing benefit, I wished to demonstrate that the list is not closed and is subject to variation from time to time. The formulation in paragraph (c) seems sufficient to cover the variety of benefits. Let us stick to that. The two benefits that at present clearly fall within it are supplementary benefit and family income supplement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, now that the thought about housing benefit has occurred to the hon. Gentleman, I am sure that he will find other occasions on which to raise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment ensures that, regardless of the person to whom it is paid, as long as the payment is not made to a fund of any sort it will be taken into account. I understand that the hon. Member for Garscadden's point involves drafting rather than substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 11, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>aa</i>) any co-habitee as defined in the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come to the end of the little run of Scottish amendments, for which 1 see that emigre Scots—refugees from their homeland—are duly grateful. We now come to the end of what is in some ways the most hopeful part of the Bill, for which great things were promised by the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no provision in the Bill in relation to the new heads of claim under clauses 8 and 9 for a cohabitee to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
be included in the definition of a relative. Put simply, I believe that some provision at least should be made for that. The Minister will remember, if he has gone through the English parts of the Bill even cursorily, that in clause 3, which gives certain rights to action for wrongful act causing death the Government introduced a provision to give a meaning to the word "dependant". It included not just husband or former wife or husband of the deceased but a person living with the deceased in the same household immediately before the date of death, who had been living there for at least two years as husband or wife. Cohabitee is written into an important new head of claim in English law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest in the amendment—no doubt in a way which would give a heart attack to any sophisticated draftsman—a similar right for the right of action for services rendered to an injured person or services to an injured person's relative, which are coming into the law of Scotland as a result of our efforts in this legislation. Clause 13 defines a relative, which is the key category on which the new rights are based. I suggest that the word "relative" should be broadened to include a cohabitee or a cohabitant—I am not sure which it should be. I am informed that the Lord Chancellor went to great lengths to decide whether the term should be "cohabitee" or a "cohabitant." This may appeal to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham). He came to the doubtful conclusion in the eyes of the purists among us that although clearly, in the niceties of English grammar, it should be cohabitant everyone understood the word "cohabitee", so we should stick to what has become, by common law and usage, an understandable term. I merely mention that passage, so perhaps the Minister could consider whether it should be "cohabitant" or "cohabitee."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that, apart from the fact that the English have done it in clause 3, we have done it very recently in the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981, to which I referred earlier. In section 18 of that Act, which is so hot off the press that we have not even had the commencement order, although we live in hope that we shall have it this summer, a reduced occupancy right is given to a cohabitee. There is an overwhelming case for doing so also on clause 13 of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society urged it. I quoted the passage earlier in which it argued for a much broader definition of the word "relative", but it said that if it did not win the broader argument;
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any event the committee are not sure why the definition of 'relative' cannot be extended to include a common law wife or a co-habitee."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to refer to the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is clear and the reasons for it are clear. If someone has been living in a stable union with another for a considerable time, and that person is injured and the cohabitee has to give up his or her employment to nurse him, I cannot see in justice and equity, given that we have recognised a cohabitee's position in the matrimonial home and in many other areas, why we should not do so here. I shall not press the amendments but I suggest that the Minister comes back on Report with a reasonable formula, perhaps giving advance
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
notice of his deliberations, to meet what seems a wholly sensible provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment and I shall also be inviting my hon. and learned Friend not to move the amendment standing in his name, because I wish to take the whole matter away and reconsider it before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will be aware that for cohabitees and cohabitants—I shall not enter into discussion over that—the Law Society of Scotland thought that the right should be extended only under clause 8 and not under clause 9. It surprises me that that distinction has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Initially, the Government were prepared to accept that limited extension. However, it is now being considered—I think that this will possibly be of greater importance than anything discussed in the last hour and 25 minutes—that "cohabitee" should be included as one of the class of persons entitled to make a claim under the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976. Broadly speaking, as I understand it, that would bring Scotland in line with what is proposed in clause 3, but it remains to be seen whether we would use exactly the same definition of "cohabitee' as in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of my wish to consider the matter and to establish the status of the cohabitee in claims for damages on a broader basis on Report and in a manner that would not restrict it simply to clauses 8 and/or 9, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. But I stress that the matter is being considered seriously and sympathetically by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful response. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) asked me how long the Scottish section would take, and I unwisely said half an hour or 40 minutes. We have just about doubled that, but by the batting record for Scottish business—I talk from personal experience—that is not too bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General for Scotland will note that I did not adopt the Law Society's distinction, because I put down the amendment to clause 13 simpliciter to broaden the term "relative". That was to include clauses 8 and 9, as he gathered from my remarks. I can see the Law Society's distinction, as I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman does, that clause 8 is dealing with the past, when the stable union of the cohabitees is a fact that can be clearly seen by the court. Clause 9 deals with a future loss after the injury that arises from the inability to give a service to relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland felt it right to give that right to a blood relative or a spouse, presumably because it believes in the indissolubility of marriage— which is an odd thing for it to believe in, considering how much of its income is derived from dissolving marriages. But it felt it wrong to give a right regarding a future loss to someone who is not married on the grounds that stable unions may dissolve at any point without legal process. I can see the argument but do not accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we should give the right in either clause 8 or 9. But I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for his suggestion that we should do something even more sweeping than that and wri:e the cohabitee into the 1976 Act as if he or she were a spouse, as has been suggested,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
getting all the rights of a spouse in terms of actions for personal damages arising from that Act. I have not considered that broader point and should like to do so. I do not know whether there are difficulties, but I am prejudiced in favour of the proposal and am glad that it is being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to withdraw the amendments and look forward to hearing the outcome of the deliberations that will ensure fairly shortly, presumably, because the Bill must come to Report before the end of the month. As the Minister is doing something that has far-reaching implications, it is very important that he tells us in good time so that some of us can get comments from those who might be interested in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 25, line 20, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) make provision for interest accruing from the investment of sums deposited with justices' clerks by way of security as a condition of bail".</p></blockquote>
Clause 38 provides a sensible extension to the power of the authorities to invest and otherwise deal with funds in court to everyone's benefit. This amendment is designed to deal with the specific problem which has been encountered by justices' clerks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes, as a condition of bail, an accused is ordered to deposit a sum of money as security for his future attendance. Sometimes it is a large sum and sometimes it is held by the court for many months. An experienced and conscientious magistrate's clerk will normally place the money on deposit so that it attracts interest. The question then arises of who is entitled to the interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Home Office has suggested that the interest should accrue to public funds. However, the money is not owed by the accused. He has not been fined; he has not even been convicted. It is there in case he fails to attend and the court orders that it should be forfeit. If he attends, he has done nothing wrong. He has simply been deprived of his money at a time when he was unconvicted. We believe that the interest should accrue to the accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some doubt about who is entitled to the interest. We should relieve justices' clerks of the risk of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
paying interest to the wrong person and being required to refund the money. I have. ventured to suggest our answer to the problem, but we would be interested to hear the Solicitor-General's answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a problem, but the Government are not yet persuaded either that the amendment is necessary or that it offers the best approach. Under clause 38(8)(e) and (/) the rules which may be made under subsection (7) can
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribed cases in which funds in court are to be invested"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"cases in which interest is to be paid on funds in court".</p></blockquote>
Clause 38 (l)(c) would allow the rules to be made in relation to magistrates courts. Therefore the Bill seems to contain adequate powers for this purpose. However, it may not be the best course to require the securities to be vested in the Accountant General. That would be the combined effect of the existing provisions if the amendment were agreed to. Justices' clerks already have to deal with sums of money paid into the court for a variety of purposes, including fines, costs, compensation and maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is empowered to make and has made regulations governing the keeping, inspection and audit of the accounts of any sums received by a justice's clerk. It may be preferable for sums deposited as security to be provided for under that umbrella. Considerations must be taken into account before a final solution is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, so that there is no doubt about it, that we recognise the problem. The sums involved are sometimes very large—about £60,000 to £100,000—and it is important to have a clear regime to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being critical because I know that without the benefit of the Government services, it is impossible for an Opposition to go into all the details. I am obliged to the right hon. and learned Gentlemen for drawing the matter to our attention. We agree that there is a problem, and I ask him to withdraw the amendment so that we can examine it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A solution, which meets both the points that I have mentioned and the others that will undoubtedly crop up when we get down to working out the details, can then be properly attended to before the appropriate step is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not wholly surprise me to be told that the amendment is probably unnecessary and that there is already power in the Bill to make appropriate provision. One of the difficulties of tabling amendments in Committee is that the Government are bound to take them literally. I am more interested not in whether the power exists to deal with the matter, but in how the Government propose to exercise the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the Solicitor-General's response and 1 hope that on Report or before he will tell me not only how it is proposed to provide the power to deal with the matter, but, when it is decided who shall have that power, how it is to be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>ASSISTANCE BY RECORDERS FOR TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS OF HIGH COURT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>At the end of the Table in section 9(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (under which certain persons may be requested to act as judges in specified courts) there shall be added—
	<br><blockquote><p>"6 A Recorder. The High Court"—	<i>[The Solicitor-General.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to restore to recorders the eligibility to sit as High Court judges if so requested by the Lord Chancellor, which they had under section 23 of the Courts Act 1971. That eligibility was removed by section 9 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and the repeal by the same Act of section 23 of the Courts Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for making the change in 1981 was because it seemed inconsistent with the terms of his appointment to require a recorder to sit for longer than the terms of his appointment allowed. The scheme of work devolution provided by section 9 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 is for the work of one permanently appointed judge to discharge in certain circumstances the functions and business of another on a different rung of the judicial ladder. It does not provide for the discharge of work by recorders who are not permanent judges, but practitioners who have agreed to sit as recorders on a certain number of days a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the change has been to prevent recorders from sitting as High Court judges. Barristers who happen to be recorders may continue to be appointed as deputy high court judges, but that possibility lias never been open to solicitors, nor has it ever been suggested that it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change has had little effect in practice because
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
solicitor-recorders have never been requested to try High Court cases. It appears, however, that solicitor-recorders have in the past been known to take interlocutory applications in defended cases or wardship cases. This very exceptional practice was no doubt of value to the parties in the cases where it occurred and this is one reason why the Government have changed their mind and are now moving to restore recorders to where they were before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason is that the changes made by the Supreme Court Act were not specifically drawn to the attention of the Law Society either before or during the passage of the Bill, and it is said by the Law Society, and accepted by the Government, that they would have wished to object to the change on the ground just mentioned, that solicitor recorders have in the past been able to help out with matrimonial applications in High Court cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are grateful to the Law Society for taking the matter up and the amendment is the result of the combined effect of all those considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
