EARLY RELEASE OF PRISONERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day],</i> No. 138, in page 28, line 26, after " life ", insert
<br><blockquote><p>" unless that sentence was imposed for a crime involving violence ".—<i>[Mr. Bendall.]</i> </p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a thorough and serious discussion of an important and sombre question and I was giving the Government's reflections upon it when we adjourned this morning.<br><br>
Before proceeding, perhaps I should give a fuller account of the nature of clause 26 than I was able to give this morning. Then I shall come to my response to the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall).<br><br>
Clause 26 seeks to provide the Government with emergency powers to be used in the event of a breakdown in our present system. The emergency nature of these powers has not been fully brought out in the course of our short discussion today. We know, all too well, from the overcrowding which exists, and from the neglected state of prison buildings, that it is a prospect for which we must make contingency plans. I stressed that this morning and it is common ground in this Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friends are worried that use may be made of clause 26 powers that goes beyond emergency use. I understand on the face of the clause as it is drafted that that could take place and that it could include the release of those who have been convicted of offences of violence against a person, provided that they had only six months or less to serve of their sentence.<br><br>
Clause 26 requires the Government to set out the categories of prisoners who may be released up to six months before their normal release date. The primary test of the seriousness of an offence—the measure applied by the courts—is the length of the sentence that they think it right to give.<br><br>
I have to acknowledge, however, that the clause is so drafted that it is the remainder of a sentence that is the criteria.<br><br>
The Government have had an opportunity to reflect on what had been said by my hon. Friend and I am grateful to him. Earlier I said that the power
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
conferred by clause 26 would not be used to secure the release of what are loosely known as violent offenders, as the Home Secretary had previously affirmed.<br><br>
However, I see the force of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North about the special connotations that offences of violence against the person have—rightfully and understandably—at present, in the country.<br><br>
I also see the force of what he said about the fact that an assurance given by one Government does not bind another. I am grateful to him, therefore for inviting us to look again at this difficult aspect of the matter. We have given careful thought to whether the problems of definition to which I referred earlier could be overcome so that the assurance that has been given by my right hon. Friend can find form in legislative language.<br><br>
I believe that it was generally accepted in Committee that no definition could be both wholly comprehensive and, at the same time, practicable. I do believe, however, that it would be possible to identify in a schedule, by means of a list, those categories of offences that are embraced by the intent of my hon. Friend's amendment and to provide prisoners serving sentences for any of those offences, would not be eligible for emergency release under the clause, so that the intention of the amendment would be met. We would be prepared to have a shot at that.<br><br>
If that proved practicable—and I have no reason to suppose that it would not—I should be prepared to bring back at a later stage a redrafted clause accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk<span class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I understand the difficulties he is experiencing. The Minister will appreciate that we all abhor violence and that we do not want violent offenders released. Nevertheless, he would surely accept that some of those who have been convicted, for example, of minor assault, are not those normally intended to be caught by the amendment but who nevertheless, would be caught by the amendment in its present form.<br><br>
In the schedule that he has suggested he will bring forward on Report, will he ensure that those convicted of minor assaults will be subject to Executive release, given the fact that they will have caused far less damage than the heroin pusher— alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs)—who may have actually destroyed more lives than someone convicted of minor fraud or, indeed, someone involved in a major fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to go further than what I have already said in response to the invitation of my hon. Friend. As I have said, no list or schedule can be entirely comprehensive of the offences of violence and at the same time be practicable. But I am prepared to see whether we we can—and I believe that we can—redraft the clause on the basis that the assurances given by my right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 423</span>
hon. Friend and myself, that we would not propose to use the powers under clause 26 for the release of what are loosely known as violent offenders, can be given form in legislation forming part of clause 26.<br><br>
If that is satisfactory to my hon. Friend, meeting as I intend that it does, the intent and purpose of his amendment, I hope that the Committee will regard that as an appropriate way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I knew it would happen and it has. We have been waiting patiently and politely to see a mini-revolt and it has happened—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An extraordinary description!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a modest description. If I wanted to give a more adequate description, I would call it a major revolt.<br><br>
This is an executive power which the Government have specifically included in the Bill to deal with an emergency situation. It was included, presumably, after a great deal of thought and because they could be faced with severe overcrowding in the prisons which would cause two situations to arise—either they would have to take over army camps to house prisoners, or they would have to use some form of Executive release, which is never the most pleasant way of doing things in a democracy. But the Government have allowed for the fact that Executive powers might be necessary in an emergency.<br><br>
I do not see what has emerged since the Minister had the time for reflection that he wanted, and the months he has had to consider the Bill. I await with great interest to see his schedule. I accept, as I said at the beginning, that there is no more offensive form of crime than a crime of violence. It is a detestable crime and personally, if I had to draw up my pet hate in crimes, it would be any crime involving violence.<br><br>
There are, however, other crimes of an equally serious nature, in some cases of a much more serious nature, than a relatively minor assault, particularly an assault not involving a weapon. Naturally, for anybody who uses a weapon in a bank robbery, it would be wrong in principle for the Home Secretary to release him, under Executive powers or not, but what about arson? That is a serious crime. Will that be included in the Schedule?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman<span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. and learned Gentleman straining at a gnat, because now that we have the mechanism of the schedule, will it not be possible to put all these undesirable crimes into the schedule, including heroin pushing and everything else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be possible. All I say is that I am waiting to see what is contained in the schedule. If it is so lengthy that it includes practically every serious crime, clearly the Executive power scheme might as well be scrapped altogether. It will be virtually useless.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 424</span>
What category of prisoner serving the last of a six months' term will be left for the Home Secretary to release, if the schedule is so long? I am not putting forward a fanciful argument. It seems commonsense to me, because there are many very serious crimes, the perpetrators of which the public would not wish to be released, in addition to violent criminals, during the last six months of their sentence.<br><br>
I suggest, therefore, that the Minister has given way—appallingly or otherwise—at the first sign of a little bit of muscle by his own Back Benchers. It is sad to see, because the hon. and learned Gentleman has done this Bill very well up to now. However, it had to happen sooner or later, and it is not for me to interevene other than to express incomprehension as to why a firm proposal in the Bill at 12.30 p.m. or thereabouts, should now be necessary to amend. It is extrordinary that such an amendment should be proposed purely because someone has mentioned something that should have been clear to the Home Secretary and to the Minister—that the public do not like people who commit crimes of violence. I knew that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor<span class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman knew that, of course, as do Conservative Members. I remind him on Second Reading the Home Secretary said specifically that categories of offender who have committed particularly serious offences, could be excluded. It is not fair of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that the Home Secretary had not thought of this until Back Benchers brought it to his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Home Secretary does not appear to have thought of it deeply, because I did not consider the arguments put forward by the Minister, in his usual cogent manner, were of such unique quality that all those officials in the Home Office had not thought deeply about them before. If they had not, they should have done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons<span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the effect of the amendment that Conservative Members do not trust the Home Secretary, and instead of leaving the matter to his discretion, they want to put it into the Bill, to make sure of no backsliding from the Home Secretary? Does it not signify a vote of no confidence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a possible conclusion. Not being a malicious person, and always anxious to see decent motives in an amendment or speech from Conservative Members, it is not a conclusion that sprang immediately to mind. But now that the hon. and learned Gentleman has drawn it to my attention, I think that is a reasonable conclusion to draw.<br><br>
I find his argument that perhaps a future Home Secretary might not be as conscious of public concern as the present Home Secretary, and might somehow launch on to the unsuspecting public a wholesale invasion of violent criminals serving the last six months of their sentence, rather a fanciful one. It really is fanciful and I cannot conceive that it is a possibility. However, it is a private argument

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 425</span>
between the hon. and learned Gentleman and- his Back Benchers.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall<span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering why, if that is the case, the hon. and learned Gentleman is so concerned to have the proposal in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not particularly concerned whether it is in or out, to be quite honest, as I made clear in my opening remarks. All I am amazed at is the sudden capitulation. The clause has been in the Bill for weeks. Its import was clear. It was quite clear that it was only to be used in an emergency and suddenly we now have a list of schedules to be included at some future time.<br><br>
I leave the matter at that. I think it is a private argument between the Minister and his Back Benchers, and one which his Back Benchers have clearly won. He has clearly capitulated. That is the only possible conclusion that can be drawn from this rather squalid little exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark<span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Really, I am amazed at the adjectives that the hon. Gentleman has been using. He has referred to this as a capitulation, and he mentioned a squalid exercise. I remind him that before we adjourned our morning sitting, my hon. and learned Friend quoted his right hon. Friend, when he said that the Home Secretary was in complete argreement with the broad principle. Then, my hon. and learned Friend, with his usual courtesy, invited the Committee to move some way towards narrowing the expression of this principle into definitive terms.<br><br>
In the first part of his speech he perhaps teased the Committee a little by quoting from the Offences Against the Person Act and said that this included certain explosive offences—<i>[Interruption.]</i><br><br>
The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) is moving about. Does he wish to intervene, or is he just shifting uneasily in his place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be better if we did not have constant interventions from a sedentary position, from any quarter of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter of definition is something that will emerge as the schedule is composed. At this stage I suggest to my hon. and learned Friend that the schedule is based principally around the offences against the person. As he rightly reminded the Committee, there are certain categories that have intruded into that group, connected with explosives and so forth, which do not make much sense and which clearly the merest application of common sense would exclude. But he quite rightly pointed out to the Committee when he was discussing this important matter of definition that sexual offences are not included because they are categorised separately.<br><br>
I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that all sexual offences carry either overtly or implicitly acts of violence or threats of violence. Certainly, the majority of them do, because even in the case of children there is no overt act of violence.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 426</span>
It has always been recognised by the law that below a certain age the victim is incapable of giving consent in a legal sense and, therefore, the act that is perpetrated is done without the child's consent. I am sure the Committee would agree that that falls within the terms that we would wish to see included as being an act of violence.<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend has allowed the Committee to help him move to a stage where he accepts not only the broad principle that his right hon. Friend has always accepted—and has, indeed, stated—but he will now allow the Committee a measure of participation in defining these offences and help him to define them and compose his schedule. That is most welcome and I am sure that it will be greeted with considerable relief and approval by the country at large.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris<span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in a little difficulty as to which way to go on amendment No. 138 until I know my hon. and learned Friend's reaction to amendment No. 139. We can all think of examples of types of criminal who we would think could be let out and types of criminal whom we would think could not be let out in the circumstances of today, but we are talking about future circumstances that we cannot entirely foresee.<br><br>
The important thing to me seems to be that Parliament at that time should be able to look at what the Home Secretary is proposing and say " Yea " or " Nay ". If we could ensure that, I would not feel any need for further specification at this stage.<br><br>
Perhaps this is almost a point of order, Mr. Watkins. I wonder whether there is any way that we can find out what my hon. and learned Friend's reaction to amendment No. 139 will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We cannot discuss an amendment until it is reached, but I am prepared to allow a certain amount of latitude in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am keen to help, as I have demonstrated, but the more one tries, the more trouble one gets into. If it will help my hon. Friend, I am very anxious to take advantage of the liberty we have been given. There is quite an important distinction between the two amendments. The second amendment which we are about to discuss relates to the circumstances in which the Home Secretary will be able to exercise th power conferred by clause 26. It is of the essence of clause 26 that it permits a speedy response to an emergency— that is the point—in that it reflects what Parliament thought right to enact in the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1979 about the prison officers' dispute, as my hon. Friend knows. That is common ground. There has to be a capacity to provide an urgent response.<br><br>
If amendment No. 139 were carried it would prevent the Home Secretary from exercising that power without prior parliamentary approval. Emergencies cannot be controlled so that they occur only when Parliament is sitting. I quite agree that when Parliament is sitting it seems to generate a number of emergencies of its own, but not exclusively, and if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 427</span>
one accepts that there is this need for an immediate response to an emergency danger then we believe that it must be available notwithstanding that Parliament is not sitting in order to be able to give it prior approval.<br><br>
I hope that helps my hon. Friend to see the Government's reaction to amendment No. 139. I hope it may be possible to make adjustments to this part of the clause without derogating from the principle that I have just explained, but that is my view of the main principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more we go on with this debate, the more muddlesome it becomes. Here we have, after a brief few hours of pressure from some Conservative elements, the Government saying that they will produce a schedule of offences. I have been sitting here for the last 10 or 15 minutes trying to think how that will be worked out.<br><br>
If we are all to be able to have an input into this, as has been suggested, I suggest that we all sit down as if we were at school and write an essay on what we think should be in the schedule and what degrees of crime and violence there should be. I can imagine the mismash that would come out of that. I do not think it will be an easier task for the parliamentary draftsmen who are more expert than anyone sitting on the Committee, at that sort of thing.<br><br>
I can also imagine the consternation and difficulties that will face social workers and probation officers when they are helping an offender, a prisoner, and are faced with this kind of schedule of violences that we appear to be facing.<br><br>
I know the Minister has not had much time between 1 p.m. and 4.30 p.m., but I hope he might give us a little more indication of the kind of crimes of violence which he might take into account, such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs). He referred to heroin pushers. In my view they are in many respects more violent to more people than, for example, somebody who in a minor way commits an act that involves some kind of violence, or something that is classified as violence.<br><br>
I referred some sessions ago to a young constituent whom I visited in a borstal, who was there for what was called a " violent" crime which consisted of his—he said accidentally—pushing a policewoman off the curb and breaking her ankle. That was a violent crime and that was why he was given six months in borstal. Although none of us condones the violence or any of the excesses that arise from this sort of thing, it is very confusing.<br><br>
We have heard a great deal from Conservative Members—we hear it constantly—about muggings, particularly of elderly people who walk our constituencies and so on. I wonder whether they have given any thought to bringing into this category crimes of domestic violence, because these are often more lightly treated by the court than crimes between two strangers or a youngster mugging an old lady, not that either is welcomed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
Although I very much want to keep people out of prison, I nevertheless believe that domestically-violent situations are in many aspects sometimes worse than the more casual kind of violence that occurs outside the home, because in the home it can continue and recur. I wonder whether the schedule that the Minister tells us he may produce will include crimes of domestic violence. Perhaps he will give a little more information about the schedule that we are to try to compose between us before we give further consideration to this particular amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that this would cause quite a debate and it certainly has. I first thank my hon. and learned Friend for his remarks. I take the point about heroin and drug pushing. Of course it is serious when young people's lives are often involved as a result of that type of criminal action. I take that point on board.<br><br>
I am pleased that my hon. and learned Friend, indeed, my right hon. Friend had an opportunity to reflect upon this. I do not find that surprising. If one examines the <i>Evening Standard</i> of iunchtime today, one will see that shortly an increase of 96 per cent, in violent crimes on the streets of London alone is to be announced. There is no question but that what I said this morning about violence increasing in the last decade has occurred, and the statistics that are now coming forward are beginning to prove exactly that.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I should tell the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) that my concern is not with my Home Secretary. It is with the decision that a future Home Secretary may make. I made that very clear this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the next Home Secretary will not belong to his party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely suggest that a future Home Secretary may take a different line, whatever party he belongs to. That would include the party that the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) has now joined.<br><br>
I thank my hon. and learned Friend for having reflected upon this matter. I strongly believe that this issue gives more concern and worry to the average person than any other issue at the present time. I believe that this reflection has been an important and major step forward. Under those circumstances, and in view of the assurances I have given—I am sure that the Minister will allow me to see what the list involves when he brings it forward —I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 29, line 2, leave out " he shall be so released " and insert
<br><blockquote><p>" his release shall be a release ".</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 429</span>
This amendment does not affect the meaning of clause 26(3). It has been introduced simply because it is an improvement on the current wording, which reflects that used in section 5(3) of the 1980 Act and which would benefit from clarification. The same improved wording was used in an amendment that the Government have tabled to schedule 14 concerning the early release of young offenders serving sentences of 18 months or more. That amendment is a transitional provision that would ensure that this group of offenders would, like extended sentence prisoners, be released on licence if early release were implemented at a time when clauses 1 to 14 had not yet been brought into force. The meaning of clause 26(3) is not affected. It is simply a clarification. It is desirable that the transitional provision in clause 26(3) should be expressed in similar terms.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 29, line 19, leave out from "Parliament; " to end of line 24.<br><br>
This has the effect of deleting clause 26(7)(6). I notice that it will also have the corollary effect of deleting subsections (8) and (9) as well, as they refer only to subsection <i>(7)(b).</i> I ask your leave, Mr. Watkins, to include that by way of a manuscript addition.<br><br>
I should like to make my position clear as to where I stand on this clause. I believe—and I should like to see to what extent I can take the whole Committee, and particularly the Minister, along with me—that there are cases in which custodial sentence is necessary as a punishment and a deterrent against the repetition of similar crimes by the person who is being put into prison. It is also necessary as a general deterrent to prevent other people from following the same road.<br><br>
I believe that we all agree that the prison sentence should be maintained at as low a level as possible, and should be for as short a time as possible, given that it must fulfil the three criteria that I mentioned. I do not think that there will be any disagreement in the Committee or in the Government so far.<br><br>
I believe that the length of the sentence must be determined by the court. My hon. and learned Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have both stated categorically that as a principle they entirely agree with that. But the Committee has been told that it will be necessary in this case, for reasons of administrative convenience and as an Executive decision, to override the decision of the court in various cases and that instead of enforcing the service of the sentence passed by the court, given the remission that the law already allows, for Executive reasons only they wish to have additional powers to shorten the sentences still further by periods of up to six months in certain circumstances.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to examine the circumstances in which such a power might be necessary, and to examine in particular just how useful the clause as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
drafted would be in fulfilling the Government's apparent aims.<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend will correct me if I am wrong, but there seems to me to be only two reasons why the Government may need such powers; and only two reasons have been put forward by the Government when asking for these powers. The first is that there might be some circumstances in which a particular prison is closed. It might be closed because it has been burnt down or because the riots there were so extensive that they could not be controlled. It might be closed for a variety of reasons which are not foreseeable now.<br><br>
In that instance we are dealing with a position where one prison has been closed and the Government do not know what to do with the people in that prison. They say that circumstances may arise when it would be impossible to take the inmates from that place and put them elsewhere in a safe place of custody. I do not believe that situation is likely to arise. But if it did, I must also question just how effective the clause as drafted, and as altered by the extremely helpful amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall), will be in those circumstances.<br><br>
In any prison only a small percentage of prisoners will fall within the category of those to be released by the Home Secretary under this provision. They cannot be released for crimes within the schedule that is still to be written. They cannot be prisoners who have longer than six months to serve before release. They cannot be prisoners who are there for long periods and still have a substantial amount of their sentence to serve. So just how useful will this emergency provision be? It seems likely that, in those circumstances where one or two prisoners are affected, the effectiveness of this provision will be questionable.<br><br>
The second set of circumstances in which the Government claim that this clause will be useful is where there is gross overcrowding in the prison system, with people coming in with fresh convictions and there is nowhere to put them. I accept that in those circumstances this could be a useful power, but this will not happen overnight and is not the kind of emergency that I believe my hon. and learned Friend has in mind. If such overcrowding is foreseen, under clause 26 as altered by my amendment, it would be possible in a very short time for the Government to bring in a statutory instrument to the House, for its merits to be considered in the light of all the circumstances applying to it and, if the merits were there, the House would undoubtedly grant the permission requested.<br><br>
I do not accept, therefore, that under the second set of circumstances it will be necessary for the Home Secretary to have the extensive power of personal decision which is incorporated in the subsection that I seek to delete.<br><br>
Overall there are 43,734 prisoners within our prison system, and 13,000 of them were there under the provisions of the subsection until this afternoon when the crimes of violence and others unspecified now to be added by schedule, have to be deducted
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0375">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 431</span>
from that figure. Overall, I do not believe that more than half of the 13,000 will be eligible for release and I must question whether the extensive breach of principle involved by this application to the Committee, is justified in those circumstances.<br><br>
It seems to me also that there will be three consequences to which the Government have not given adequate consideration, should we allow the clause to go ahead in its present form. First, in certain circumstances, it would be a considerable incitement in certain prisons to create trouble because, if the prisoners know that the consequence of creating a disturbance is sufficient to make the Government consider closing that prison, thereby obtaining the early release of a proportion of the inmates, clearly there will be additional incentive for them to create that problem. I do not think that the Government, or any other hon. Member, would desire that kind of additional incentive to be given.<br><br>
Secondly, I believe it leads to uncertainty—uncertainty that is unfortunate and uncertainty that arises out of the decision which may be taken to override the sentence that the court has considered to be the appropriate one to serve. For example, I am not quite clear whether this clause will allow people who might have been eligible for parole to be released after six months before their eligibility for parole arises.<br><br>
It it does allow, clearly this will give the Home Secretary powers to release someone whom the Parole Board has not considered and whom it may well consider to be inappropriate for parole. This cannot be a sensible course of action for the Government to take, particularly because, under clause 26(4) anyone who has been released under that subsection cannot be brought back. The sentence is deemed to have been served from the day of release.<br><br>
My next point is with regard to the safeguards in the Bill because the clause is only supposed to be operated in certain circumstances. First, it could be said that it will be operated only in circumstances in which it is necessary to do so in order to make the best use of the places available for detention.<br><br>
But it could be argued perfectly properly by the Home Secretary that a custodial sentence is not a desirable sentence for some people in those prisons to be serving anyway, and the best way in which the prison could be used would be that those particular people should be released. That would be a perfectly proper attitude for a Home Secretary to take, one with which I should wholly disagree but one which I suggest the hon. Members for York (Mr. Lyon) and Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons)— neither of whom are here at present—both of whom dislike custodial sentencing in principle, would be perfectly likely to take in the less likely event of their being the Home Secretary of the day.<br><br>
It is quite wrong, therefore, for anyone to suggest that the reason for the amendment is distrust of the present Home Secretary. It is nothing of the kind. But when we are legislating as we are now for the foreseeable future—and I can see no Government seriously amending the laws we are passing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
now for considerable time—we must look ahead to see what other Home Secretaries may do, given the powers that we are incorporating in the Bill.<br><br>
It is not right for the Committee to legislate— because of the short term difficulties in the prison service—in such a way that in the long term future these undesirable powers will be given to future Home Secretaries.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
As I say, the prisoners concerned could not be brought back. Therefore, one of the consequences could be that during the 40-day period that the Home Secretary of the day makes this order without recourse to the House, he could release all the prisoners in the category to which he is entitled to release them and could then come to the House for ratification. There is nothing whatever that the House could then do about it because the prisoners have been released under subsection (4), as I have said, and from the moment of their release their sentence is finished. For my hon. and learned Friend to talk, as he does, of Parliamentary safeguards in this Bill, I must, with the greatest respect, say that the Parliamentary safeguards as drafted at the moment are wholly inadeqate to contain the behaviour of a future, and less sensible, Home Secretary than the one we have at the moment.<br><br>
I must also take issue slightly with my hon. and learned Friend on the question of the amount of consultation that has gone into this particular clause. For example, this morning when referring to clause 25, he rightly said that we cannot ignore the opinions of those passing the sentence when deciding whether to take option A or option B regarding these matters. With that I entirely and wholly agree. One such body—perhaps the principal body—concerned with this, is, of course, the Magistrates' Association. That body was singled out for praise this morning in no uncertain terms, and perfectly correctly so. However, what we ought to do with regard to the Magistrates' Association's opinion this morning should also be done with regard to the Magistrates' Association's opinion this afternoon. Every member of the Committee, at least according to my information, was sent a letter by the Magistrates' Association this morning in which the secretary said:
<br><blockquote><p>" Magistrates are concerned at the extent of the power given to the Home Secretary under clause 26. The Magistrates' Association urges that paragraph <i>1(b)</i> be deleted and that consequential amendments be made in paragraph 8 so that it would be required in each instance for a draft of the order to be laid before Parliament and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
In my submission, the magistrates are absolutely correct in saying that the principle that the sentence that they have passed is the sentence that ought to be served—which is one of the most fundamental principles of the sentencing policies of our courts— should not be breached by this Bill.<br><br>
I take the point that my hon. and learned Friend has made that there may be remote circumstances in which the Home Secretary of the day needs some emergency power during the recess when the House is not available. That is quite possible. However, the exemptions as they are drafted in the Bill are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
far too wide and give him far too great a power and cannot be justified by the necessity for some other, and lesser, safeguard built into the Bill at a later stage. In those circumstances, I ask the Committee to support my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parris</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor). His amendment, though of a rather abstract kind, is equally if not more important than the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall). My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North was trying, I think rightly, to freeze into the legislation our own attitudes as to the type of prisoner who shoud be released early. That may be wise, but more important than freezing our own attitudes into the legislation is to make sure that we do not stay the hand of future Parliaments so that they are unable to say " Yea " or " Nay " to what a future Home Secretary may plan to do.<br><br>
If it were proposed that a Home Secretary should take powers to extend the sentences which prisoners were serving we would all feel that he should not be able to implement those powers without Parliamentary approval in every case, the reason being that the prisoners would be possible victims of unjust or unwise decisions.<br><br>
If a Home Secretary takes powers to release prisoners early from their sentences, the possible victims are not the prisoners. The possible victims of an unwise Executive decision are the general public. For that reason, I do not think we should agree to allow a future Home Secretary in any circumstances to take those powers without first consulting Parliament.<br><br>
Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich, I can envisage circumstances in which an emergency might arise and these things might have to be done rather fast. But Parliament can, in exceptional circumstances, be recalled rather quickly. I think these would be very exceptional circumstances and they would justify the recall of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) for the way in which he moved the amendment, and also for the speech that has just been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris). I begin by expressing my entire agreement with the principles set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich which he felt commanded general support. I think it is plainly right, and it is fundamental, that the length of custodial sentences —just as the decision as to whether someone should go into custody or stay in the community—should lie with the courts.<br><br>
The length of sentence ought to be a decision that remains with the judiciary if the judiciary decides that a custodial sentence is proper. There is no argument about that. Of course that is right.<br><br>
Equally, my hon. Friend was absolutely right when he said that there must always be a place for a custodial sentence, and I agree with the criteria that he said a custodial sentence should fulfil. Equally, he is right when he says that if there has to be custody it should be at as low a level and of as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
short a duration as possible. By that I understand him to mean that it should be consistent with the safety of the public. So we start from that common ground.<br><br>
What it all boils down to, it seems to me, is whether or not we believe that there is a need for a power for the Home Secretary to take emergency action of a knd that is distasteful because it conflicts with the principles that we have just identified —in particular with the principle that the length of custody should rest with the judiciary. The question is whether we regard it as necesary that the Home Secretary should have a power to take emergency action and if so, whether there are any circumstances in which he ought to be able to do so without Parliament giving prior authority.<br><br>
The Magistrates' Association must always be heeded, and I was impressed by what that body had to say in the letter to which my hon. Friend referred. I am not, however, entirely in agreement with him when he says that the issues are on all fours, because I spoke of the weight which the opinion of the Magistrates' Association must carry in the amendment and in the issue we were discussing this morning. They are the people who actually pass the sentences, and the issue that was under discussion before we adjourned was what would happen to sentences in a certain eventuality. In other words, what kind of sentencing pattern would result?<br><br>
It seemed to me that the opinion of the Magistrates' Association should carry particular weight there because they are the people who actually pass the sentences. They are not, happily for them, the people who have responsibility for administering the prisons. That responsibility rests with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I absolutely accept that the matter was not entirely on all fours, but I am sure my hon. and learned Friend would agree that the confidence of the Magistrates' Association that the integrity of the sentences they see fit to pass is maintained without interference by the Executive, is also a matter of prime importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is, and be it noted that this power, which in its essence exists already and has done since we passed the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1980, was never once used. It is intended for emergency purposes, and happily we have not yet experienced such an emergency as to warrant asking Parliament to authorise it.<br><br>
I agree that the magistrates must have confidence that the sentences that they pass will not be interfered with and will not be reduced arbitrarily by Executive action. Equally, the whole country must have confidence that if things go very badly wrong with the prison system the means exist for Government to take the emergency action that the safety of the public will require.<br><br>
If this were a general sort of clearance order, a general gaol delivery, and the Home Secretary could say " Off you go " to everyone in prison, there would be grounds for considerable alarm. It is not that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
at all. It is a power given to the Home Secretary to specify only from among those who have less than six months to serve, a class or classes of people who may be released early from a prison or prisons. It is hedged about with a greater degree of parliamentary control than Parliament saw fit to put into the 1980 Act.<br><br>
I take my hon. Friend's point when he says that argument does not wash when Parliament is not sitting. I accept that as well as the period in which Parliament is in recess, there is an additional period of up to 40 days before the Home Secretary has to get Parliament's authority for the exercise of the power that he has used in advance of parliamentary authority.<br><br>
It boils down, as I have already said, to whether we are content that such a power should only be exercised with parliamentary authority or whether we believe that in every circumstance Parliament should be recalled if it is in recess. I think there may be circumstances in which that would not be practicable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been round this course once before. We will not go round it completely again. If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the potential emergency in the prisons, rather than enacting clause 26, he should be enacting an early release scheme or the parole scheme or actually reducing the numbers in prison, not taking Executive action of this type to deal with the emergency once it happens. I entirely endorse what his hon. Friend said. If the Minister had any sense he would accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting speech, though it did not necessarily take me by surprise. It served to interrupt what I hoped would be of help to the Committee. I was about to draw attention to one or two precedents, which is always helpful, and to consider whether they have any value. There are precedents other than section 8 of the 1980 Act for avoiding the need to lay orders in draft in cases of emergency—for example, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978, the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976 and the Northern Ireland Act 1974. Those are cases where we have thought it right to do what this clause proposes.<br><br>
If the only procedure for the making of an order were then set out in subsection 7(a), the difficulties would be as follows. First, an order may be made in draft only on a Sitting day, thus an emergency arising in the long recess would mean that Parliament would have to be specially recalled, even at weekends. That might cause problems when Parliament was in session. Secondly, even at a time when Parliament was sitting, there might be some delay in obtaining the necessary affirmative resolutions. The Standing Orders of the House of Lords require the draft Order to have been considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments before it may be debated in the House. The Joint Committee normally sits only once a week. The Standing Orders might therefore need to be suspended. The same
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
rule does not apply in the House of Commons, but it is usual for the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments to consider a draft order before it is debated.<br><br>
I mention those practical difficulties because they indicate that even if Parliament is sitting, circumstances may arise which if my hon. Friend's amendment were carried it would not be possible, given the best will in the world, to get the prior authority for what might have to be done. It is very seldom, it seems to me, that one is confronted with an issue in which it is self-evidently all black or all white. I quite agree that we should be very hesitant seeking to enable the executive in any circumstances to override the orders and sentences of the independent judiciary—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Ormskirk laughs. I do not know why. The great feature of being in the Opposition is that one can afford to laugh. When one actually bears responsibility not only for the administration of justice but also, as my right hon. Friend does, for prisoners whose present inadequate capacity is due very largely to the neglect of one's political opponents and predecessors, it becomes really not a laughing matter.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Ryman<span class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the point of whether the Home Secretary should have power to order releases in the cases referred to, and on the accepted principle—by me, at any rate—that it is highly undesirable to interfere with the wishes of the judiciary when passing sentence, why can this early release scheme not be done by a reference by the Home Secretary to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that one could consider that suggestion, but the same difficulties about urgent action may apply there, not by reference to the same Standing Orders or subordinate legislation, but I think that it may not be capable of being taken within a matter of days or a day, when events may arise which make that necessary.<br><br>
I am prepared to look again at this aspect of the matter which has been ventilated by the amendment. We approach any interference with the orders of the judiciary with great caution. If there be ways in which the safety of the public and the administration of the prison system can be secured in a way that moves, at any rate, towards what my hon. Friend is suggesting, I for one will be very happy to do it. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept from me that we will—in the light of what he said, when we have studied it, and what my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West said—look at this again. I cannot, as he will understand, give a commitment because at the moment I see that there is a very strong case for enabling us to act in a very rare case when Parliament might not be sitting.<br><br>
I take my hon. Friend's point that, in the case of overcrowding, if it reaches a level where it becomes really intolerable, it does not have the same character or quality of a sudden emergency that is presented by a riot, a fire or something of that sort. There is force in his argument, and plainly it will be easier
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0378">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
to get parliamentary authority in advance of that than in the case of a sudden emergency.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will think that I have dealt with the matter that he raised. I could take further time by explaining the interaction of this with parole. There is no difficulty there and, if he would like me to do so I will, but he probably does not wish me to take up time on technical matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire whatever to be difficult, but I should be interested to know what the relationship is between this and parole, because it is very important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What one looks at is the earliest day of release. The only date at which a prisoner would otherwise be released is the earliest day of release. That is a date two-thirds of the way through sentence, plus any period of forfeiture of remission. Clause 26 cannot be used to release prisoners six months earlier than a parole eligibility date or a parole target date. Of course, if a prisoner is due for release on parole at a date earlier than he would fall to be released under a clause 26 order, he will be released at that earlier date on parole. If, however, he is entitled to be released under clause 26 before he would otherwise expect to be released on parole, early release under clause 26 will prevail.<br><br>
I want to think about what my hon. Friend said, as will my right hon. Friend. It is an important matter on which I hope I have made clear the Government's foundation position. If my hon. Friend is content with that, having regard to the short time we have had to consider these matters, it might be the most helpful way in which to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall act responsibly, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested that we should. He is right to take back the amendment and have another look at it. I was quite persuaded by the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument on the basis that the whole purpose of the clause—one which no one likes in itself, having powers which no Home Secretary would like to use—would be used only in a dire emergency.<br><br>
It seems to me, if the emergency is so great, that a Home Secretary has to use the clause, it is possible that the emergency may arise at a time when Parliament is not sitting and when the whole paraphen-alia in recalling Parliament will mitigate against the very purpose of the use of these emergency executive powers.<br><br>
No one in this Committee will disagree with the arguments which were put forward so persuasively by the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir. N. Bonsor). Clearly, the sentence itself and the length of the sentence must left to the judiciary and should be intereferred with only in the most exceptional and grave emergency circumstances. However, we are all appraised of the difficulties that would face a Home Secretary given these powers and the reluctance with which he would wish to use them, but we appreciate the necessity for those powers.<br><br>
In the circumstances, the Minister is right to have another look at the amendment to see whether the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
arguments of the hon. Gentleman can be met by the Home Office officials and himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for explaining the Government's reaction. However, I stress once again the point which I consider to be extremely important. It is that, at present, particularly in the vacation, the powers that have been given to the Home Secretary are draconian in their extent. Let us suppose that the House rises at the end of July. That leaves the Home Secretary with August, September and October before his 40 days even begin to run. Just before the Christmas Recess, he may have to come back to the House and ask it, four months after the order has been made for the release of prisoners, to ratify the decision that he took four months earlier.<br><br>
By that time, the bird will undoubtedly have flown. That is the point that I stress above all others in this matter, and that arises in Clause 26 (8). In that subsection, I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the powers of the Home Secretary are also extended, so that without prejudice to his rights of making a new order, the powers he is given and the restraints that Parliament is allowed to put upon him are without prejudice to anything he might do by way of making a new order.<br><br>
In fact, therefore, it would be perfectly possible for the order he made first to expire and, before the House could do anything about it, he could make a fresh order which could then run on for a further 40 days before the House had any say in the matter.<br><br>
In all circumstances, I am pleased that my hon. and learned Friend has accepted that there are shortcomings in the Bill as it is currently drafted. I have no wish to force any swift decision upon him, and I have no wish for the Committee to take steps to amend the Bill in such a way that, having removed one shortcoming of the Bill, we merely replace it with another shortcoming.<br><br>
I accept that emergencies may arise where the Home Secretary should have powers, but they should be more carefully drafted and more limited than those contained in the Bill.<br><br>
In all the circumstances, I feel it right to ask leave of the Committee to withdraw my amendment, with the strong possibility that I will wish to bring it up on Report if we are unable to arrive at a sensible agreement in the meantime.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 30 provides for a general increase in maximum fines for summary offences.<br><br>
We all understand why Governments feel it necessary from time to time to provide for a general increase in maximum fines. This Government, of course, more than any other, have increased the rate and the level of inflation. Therefore, it is not unnatural that they want to raise the level of fines, too. The way in which fines are being raised in the Bill provides a clear commentary on the Government's economic policy. However, Mr. Watkins, I think that you would rule me out of order if I began to stray into that court. The previous Government did much the same in the last Criminal Law Act 1977, but to a lesser extent.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to clarify briefly the effect the clause will have on the period which offenders are liable to spend in prison for fine default. Today, the maximum period of imprisonment which magistrates can impose for fine default is governed by section 59 of the Criminal Law Act 1977, which provides, as the Minister will recall, that courts may order up to seven days' imprisonment for non-payment of a fine of up to £25. They may impose 14 days for non-payment of a fine of up to £50, after which there is a graduated scale to a maximum of 12 months' imprisonment which courts may order for non-payment of fines in excess of £5,000.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will accept that it would be unfair if people became liable to serve longer periods in prison for fine default merely because of the pace of inflation. We do not want one of the unintended consequences of the Prime Minister's and the Chancellor's lunatic economic policy to be that more people actually spend time in prison than would otherwise have been the case. If the graduated scale in the Criminal Law Act 1977 remains the same, someone who would have been fined £25 a few years ago but, let us say, because of inflation is now fined £50, would become liable to serve double the period of time in prison for fine default, even though the amount that he had failed to pay was exactly the same in real terms.<br><br>
I am certain that the Minister does not intend that to be a consequence of the inflation-proofing of the fines in the Bill. But I suggest that it is important that the hon. and learned Gentleman should meet that issue and say so clearly and explicitly. As we are raising maximum fines to meet inflation, will the Minister agree to look at that aspect again? Will he look at the maximum periods of imprisonment for fine default that can be imposed, and perhaps give an assurance that he will review the matter to take account of inflation?<br><br>
Have I been talking long enough for the Minister to be properly seized of the matter? I deliberately extended my remarks in the hope that the Minister would be ready to reply.<br><br>
I am looking for an assurance that the Minister will review the maximum periods of imprisonment

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
that can be imposed for fine default. The logical consequences of the Bill seem to be that we are now increasing the amounts of fines to be paid for certain offences due to the disastrous, lunatic and callous economic policy upon which the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have embarked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that the provision will not have the effect of upgrading the alternative length of imprisonment that may be ordered to be served in default of paying a fine. In other words, upping the amount of a fine expressed in money terms will not have the effect of increasing the alternative period to be served in prison. It is merely an adjustment of the scale. There is no effect on the periods for default implemented and brought about by clause 30, but there is power to alter the sums in schedule 4 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 to prevent the inflation-proofing power having the adverse consequence which the hon. Gentleman and I do not wish to occur.<br><br>
If that can be expressed more clearly or more fully, I will find some means of doing so in the course of this part of the Bill, and, failing that, I shall write, but obviously it would be wrong simply because inflation has increased the amount of money which is proper as the maximum fine for a certain offence that that should have a similar corresponding effect on the custodial sentence that the courts are empowered by this Bill, or by other legislation, to impose for default of paying the fine.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to make that clear, and perhaps we may leave it like that.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>" (i) sections 40(5) and 44(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1972 ".</p></blockquote>
This amendment adds to the enactments specified in subsection (1) of clause 31, sections 40(5) and 44(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1972. That subsection disapplies the general uprating achieved by clause 30 to specified enactments where the appropriate up-rating is already achieved by other means. These provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1972 are being dealt with in Clause 47 of the Transport Bill nqw before the House as regards both the formulation of the offences and the increases in penalties, and we need to avoid an overlap of the uprating. The amendment, therefore, ensures that the increases in the penalties in the relevant sections of the Road Traffic Act 1972 are left entirely to the Transport Bill.<br><br>
I think that makes good sense, and I hope that is all I need to say about it.</span></p>

GENERAL INCREASE OF MAXIMUM FINES UNDER SUBORDINATE INSTRUMENTS</div> <!-- title -->

<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 34, line 22, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" (7A) Notwithstanding subsections (5) and (7) above, the specified amount in respect of any bye-law made by virtue of section 9 of the Airports Authority Act 1975 relating to the selling or distributing of anything, the offering of anything for sale or hire or the making up of any offer of services by any person without permission of the British Airports Authority, shall be increased to Level 4 on the Standard Scale.".</p></blockquote>
I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter which is giving concern to the British Airports Authority. I think I should also declare some sort of an interest, as I represent the licensed taxi trade in the House of Commons and part of the amendment involves the undesirable practice of taxi drivers at airports touting for fares.<br><br>
The British Airports Authority considers that penalties of £100 prescribed in relation to offences under their BAA byelaws at its seven airports are inadequate. To give an example, the prescribed penalty in 1965 was £25; index-linked to March 1982, that is £138. In 1971, the BAA had the authority to prescribe a penalty of £100; index-linked to March 1982, that is £406. In 1975, the Airports Authority Act 1975 referred to a penalty of £100; index-linked to March 1982, that is £254.<br><br>
The real concern of the authority is that, with the existing byelaws, it is very difficult to be able to increase the fines to the sort of figure that it feels would be a real deterrent to taxi touts at the airports. The sort of figure that the authority feels would be correct is a figure in the region of £500. That is why my amendment refers to the scale in the Bill on the previous page, item 4 in clause 29(2), which is £500.<br><br>
The problem is increasing and there is a lot of public concern about taxi touting at airports. A lot has been said about the subject on Radio 4, in the " Today " programme. The police at the airports are in favour of an increase in the penalty. They need an effective deterrent to taxi touting which they believe has become a serious problem at the airports.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee for long over this. I hope that in view of my remarks and of an immense amount of additional information that I can give to the Minister if he wishes, he will agree to look at this, because it is a matter of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
real concern to the airport authorities. If he would agree to look at it I should feel in a position to ask leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the helpful way in which the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) moved this amendment. I have a good deal of sympathy with his view, because taxi touts are a bunch of people who give their honest and legal colleagues in the private car hire industry a bad name, very unjustly. Foreign visitors arriving at our major airports are particularly vulnerable. We appreciate that the British Airports Authority has a problem in providing a sufficient deterrent as a means of enforcing the law. If by chance touts are prosecuted and fined under byelaw provisions derived from section 9 of the Airports Authority Act 1975—and in 1981 there were 272 convictions at Heathrow and 51 at Gatwick for the offence of " offering of services "—the fines can often be discounted against their excessive profits. So I see the problem there.<br><br>
I think the hon. Gentleman knows that there is another side to it. Taxi-touting may yield what would seem to us to be excessive profits, but one must keep a perspective between the maximum fine that is appropriate for this sort of offence and the kind of maximum fine which is appropriate to the more serious offences of having no hire and reward insurances or even no MOT certificate, which threaten the physical safety of the passenger.<br><br>
That is one of the matters that have to go into the balance, as it were. I am grateful for the offer of my hon. Friend to supply me with further information. He will know that the provisions on penalties in taxi and hire car legislation which are already in the Bill are intended to rectify existing anomalies. He will also know that the amendment, if accepted, would create a new one unless we were able at the same time to undertake a comprehensive revision of taxi and hire-care penalties. We are already hoping to do this, and I think that my hon. Friend, who represents the association in this House with great ability, already knows that we hope to do this and to issue a consultation paper in the very near future.<br><br>
I think that a wholesale revision of taxi and hire car penalties should await the outcome of that revision, so there seems to be a prima facie reason for not making an individual or one-off increase of a specific penalty or maximum fine within this category.<br><br>
I should be very glad to see the material which my hon. Friend is offering to send us, and I gratefully accept his proposal to withdraw the amendment, having very properly made use of it to raise this issue which I can see is of importance to a wider section of the public than his own constituents and members of the association he represents. I shall be very glad if he is content, in view of what I have said, to follow the course that he has suggested.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that a consultation paper is coming in the future. It has been coming, for rather a long time, and people are getting concerned in the trade and other areas and are wondering how much longer it will be before the consultation paper is published. I am delighted to learn from my hon. and learned Friend that it will be soon. That is very helpful. I would just remind him that the BAA byelaws are slightly different from problems of touting at airports and generally on the streets of London or elsewhere.</span></p>

Daily and other types of periodic fine—per week, per month, and so on—are expressly excluded from the uprating effects of the Bill by virtue of clauses 30(4) and 32(4). They are so inconsistent in their formulation that a general approach would not work satisfactorily in practice. We need also to exclude such fines from the application of clause 33, which converts maximum fines on the standard scale, and this amendment ensures that clause 33 does not apply to them.</span></p>

FINES FOR CERTAIN OFFENCES UNDER MERCHANT SHIPPING ACTS AND PREVENTION OF OIL POLLUTION ACT 1971</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p> " either summarily or on indictment ".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is designed to make clause 36 work for Scotland. Clause 36 effects amendments to the penalties for certain offences under the Merchant Shipping Acts 1894 and 1979 and the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971. These Acts extend to Scotland, and therefore it is necessary that Clause 36 should extend to Scotland also. As presently drafted, the clause refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>" an offence triable either way ".</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
That phrase is defined for England and Wales by section 34 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 as an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable either on indictment or summarily. There is, however, no corresponding statutory definition for Scotland, and therefore it is necessary to delete the reference to:
<br><blockquote><p>" an offence triable either way "</p></blockquote>
and to replace it with a specific reference to an offence triable
<br><blockquote><p>" either summarily or on indictment"</p></blockquote>.</span></p>
