	<br><blockquote><p>" and (d) but for the power to include requirements under subsection (3C) above, it would have made a detention centre order in resect of a child or young person or would have passed a youth custody sentence on him.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that before magistrates specify requirements in a supervision order under clause 19(3), they not only consult supervisors as they are obliged to do but reach agreement with them as to what specific requirements are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be almost over-familiar by now with the White Paper on Young Offenders and will know also that the White Paper proposed to give the courts specific power to order a juvenile offender, under supervision, to undertake a programme of specified activity which has been agreed between the supervising probation officer or social worker and the court as being suitable for that particular child or young person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 43 will ensure that the Bill more accurately and closely reflects that intention. Two possible consequences, both of them unintended— certainly by the Government—could result if the agreement of the supervisor to the inclusion is not added to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that an atmosphere of mistrust is growing between the magistrates and supervisors and also that the limited community resources are not efficiently and sensibly used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in most cases, consultation between the magistrates and the supervisor will be good in the proper sense of the word " consultation". The Minister will no doubt say, as he said when
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
replying earlier that it would be a foolish magistrate who would go against the wishes of the supervisor. However, it is possible that some magistrates may not indulge in proper consultation, but merely token consultations. Indeed, even if there were proper and fairly elaborate consultations, it is posr sible that the supervisor's recommendations could be disregarded. As the Minister well knows, consultation is a very vague word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will understand that for a supervision order to be carried out effectively, the supervisor ought to be enthusiastically and energetically committed to the recommendations of that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear is—and certainly the fear of NACRO and one or two other bodies—that if the Bill is enacted without the necessity for the supervisor's consent, the supervisor might be faced with having to implement, carry out and enforce requirements of the order with which he does not agree, for which he has half-hearted enthusiasm and for which, ultimately, the local authority will have to take financial responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, as I said, an atmosphere of distrust between magistrates and supervisors would develop, and magistrates' confidence and faith in the ability of social service departments and probation officer services to provide administrative supervision in the community for juvenile offenders, would be severely dented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second danger is that it might lead to inefficient use of community facilities and resources, as well as to a use of those resources that is not the most appropriate and helpful for the young offender, and in the long run for the wider community. The purpose of the Bill is to develop, as the Minister knows, a number of different community facilities for dealing with children in trouble. That is the purpose of the clause. These would range from programmes structured primarily as a true alternative to custody, which would be more appropriate and would be geared to the serious and persistent offenders. There would also be more relaxed programmes that would be more relevant, and specifically geared, to minor offenders. There is a danger that magistrates, if consultation is only to be required, might use those projects in which they have true faith—which are more suitable for those designed for one type of offender, namely, the more serious type of offence— for juveniles who would not otherwise be sent to custody. Magistrates might do this because they were not sufficiently aware, or they did not know about, other programmes and projects that would be more appropriate for dealing with a juvenile who has committed a minor offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, if a juvenile who is sent on what I might call the stiffer regime re-offends, he might well automatically be sent to formal custodial treatment, which he might not have been sent to if he had offended against a less harsh programme more suited to a minor offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the purpose of both the amendments, but so that I do not have to raise the matter in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
"clause stand part" debate, let me refer to something that is a mystery to me? What if the supervisor is not known at the time of the making of the order? How does one consult with a supervisor if it is not known who it will be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that this applies equally to the terms of the Bill and to the terms of my amendment, because the person who actually draws up the report in court is not necessarily—frequently he is not—the person who will carry out the supervision. In those circumstances I should be grateful if the Minister would clear up what seems to be, on the face of it, a serious anomaly in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman rightly spoke of it being common ground that a strengthened supervision order, pursuant to the provisions of this clause, should be made only after consultation with the officer, whether he is a probation officer or a social worker, who will be the supervising officer. It is common sense that that should be the case. The nub of amendment No. 43 is whether consultation is enough—'that is, the obligation to consult—or whether it should be a condition precedent of a supervision order under the clause that the supervising officer shall have agreed to the terms of the supervision order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not express myself in the precise words attributed to me this morning by the hon. and learned Gentleman, at least I hope that I did not. He said that I had expressed the opinion that it would be a foolish magistrate who went against the wishes of the supervisor. I do not believe that I said that. What I said was that if there is a major difference of opinion between the supervisory officer and the magistrates when a supervision order is contemplated, it would be questionable whether a magistrates' court should proceed with a supervision order in those circumstances. Consultation is the important point. I am sure that we would be unwise to go further than the statutory obligation incorporated in the Bill to consult before making a supervision order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason is that it is for the courts to decide in their discretion what sentence or order meets the justice of the case overall. Of course, we give directions and guidelines. We say, most notably, that in the case of a young offender they shall not make a custodial order unless satisfied that no noncustodial order would be appropriate, but to go as far as the amendment, which requires the consent of the supervising officer, would be to place the supervising officer over and above the courts. That would not be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are well aware of the argument put forward by the local authority associations that this provision could create an area of local authority expenditure over which they have no control. If the court could include a requirement in a supervision order only with the consent of the supervisor, the supervising services could control their expenditure. To his credit, the hon. and learned Gentleman did not advance the expenditure argument in support of his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
This would not be a realistic arrangement. We have already acknowledged that this provision could result in a financial burden on local authorities. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services gave them an undertaking that they will be provided with additional resources to meet any additional expenditure arising from the implementation of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already includes the provision that the courts should consult. That gives the supervisor ample opportunity to advise the court about the suitability of the requirements that the court proposes to make. It also allows the supervisor to explain to the court if the facilities involved are unduly expensive. The courts are likely in general to be grateful for advice of this kind and to act in accordance with it. They are not divorced from the areas which they serve. I do not think that the supervising services can ask for a great deal more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears that underlie the amendment are exaggerated. The Government can establish that they have already recognised the concern of local authorities and made careful allowance for it, but to go as far as this amendment is to put the cart before the horse. We must insist that the magistrates or the higher courts should be the bodies that exercise judicial discretion to make use of such orders and disposals as Parliament thinks it right to make available. It must not be a condition precedent that they have the consent of this person or that, however dedicated or experienced in his own sphere. The point is that the spheres are limited and do not extend to the making of judicial decisions. The court in making a supervision order will need to decide on the supervisor—that is, the probation officer or social services worker—and will then be required to consult, possibly adjourning to do so. That is the answer to the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, if there is an obligation to consult, one cannot consult until one has decided who the person is to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment would have the effect that the strengthened supervision order could be used only as an alternative to the three sentences specified in the amendment, that is,
	<br><blockquote><p>" a detention centre order or a care order in respect of a child or young person or … a youth custody sentence."</p></blockquote>
I see entitrely what lies behind this and it is a perfectly proper consideration—to ensure as far as possible that the strengthened supervision order introduced by the clause is used as a serious alternative to a custodial sentence or a care order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are difficulties about legislating in this way. The amendment raises the same kind of difficulty as some of the earlier ones which sought to provide guidelines for the sentencing practice of the courts. There is some doubt whether it would be at all effective as there is no criterion against which it could be judged whether or not the courts would otherwise have passed a custodial sentence or made a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
care order. It is not desirable to include in legislation provisions that do not add to the substantive effect of what one is saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are making provision to strengthen the confidence of the courts in the supervision order, partly in the hope that the courts will then use it in some cases instead of a custodial sentence. The new supervision order has a proper function as a disposal in its own right and not solely as an alternative to custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same may be said of each of the other sentences, particularly the care order. They cannot be seen as sentences that should be used only in the absence of an appropriate provision for supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty may be put in this way. If, as the amendment proposes, the new supervision powers are to be used only where the courts would otherwise have imposed a care or a custodial sentence, why have those sentences at all? The point is that they each occupy a different position in the sentencing tariff and cannot be regarded as direct and exclusive alternatives to each other. They are not interchangeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach the Government have adopted is to strengthen non-custodial disposals and to make their range wider, and to try to put custodial sentences slightly further from the immediate reach of the courts. If I can express it in this way: we want to stretch the tariff rather than to compress it, which would be the effect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 has been carefully framed so that any decision to impose a custodial sentence on a young offender should be unequivocal and inevitable. The court can impose such a sentence only when it is satisfied that no other method of dealing with the offender is appropriate. Other methods include a supervision order under the provisions of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new supervision order could be very powerful—that is our intention—but it cannot be regarded as being as drastic or serious a measure as a custodial sentence. The supervision order is an important disposal in its own right, as well as being a measure that can be used instead of custody. We want custodial sentences to recede from the immediate focus of the courts and regain their true perspective as an ultimate sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us in the Committee agree that custodial sentences for young offenders have increased in frequency because there have been areas of the country where there was insufficient confidence in the adequacy of supervision orders on the part of the courts. On the other hand, this amendment would serve to blur the strong distinction which we wish to maintain between community-based disposals and custodial disposals. So, although I wholly understand the objective that lies behind the amendment—which has been well expressed by the hon. and learned Gentleman—I am not able to recommend that the Committee accepts it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great care to what the Minister said. It seemed to me that he was not really addressing himself to the thrust of these two amendments. I put my name down
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
to the second one—amendment No. 44—because on the whole I prefer it to the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke in terms of fettering the power to make a supervision order. That is not what the amendments are concerned with, if I have correctly understood this rather complex clause. As I understand clause 19, there are two parts in it. The first part, in giving power to make a supervision order, gives the court power to require the supervised person to comply with whatever directions within a certain compass were made by the supervisor. It leaves the way in which the supervised person is dealt with very much within the discretion of the supervisor. Just as we would not want to fetter the powers of a court any more than is essential, so also once a supervision order has been made we would not want to fetter the supervisor's powers any more than is necessary. He will exercise them according to how his charge behaves, taking into account the circumstances of the particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause then goes on to permit the court itself to make specific requirements. I suppose it was intended that the courts would exercise that power only in very rare cases, that is to say, in those cases where it takes the view that it is insufficient simply to give the powers to the supervisor and that it is necessary to add the court's own directions to those powers, overriding the general discretion of the supervisor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to that second situation, as I understand it, that my hon. and learned Friend's amendments are directed. Therefore, they do not bite upon the general power to make a supervision order. Surely, in that second set of circumstances the court would include its own requirements in such rare cases, because in any normal case it would be wholly sufficient to leave the discretion within the hands of the supervisor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I favour amendment No. 44, which makes it quite clear that this second power—this much more stringent power which the court would exercise—will be used only in the rarest circumstances, where otherwise it would have felt itself compelled to have a custodial order against the offender. That seems to me to be a perfectly logical and reasonable fetter on the discretion of the court, just as the clause already imposes certain fetters on the power of the court to make requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This additional fetter would in my view be highly desirable. It would make it quite clear that it is indeed in those circumstances that the court should impose requirements of this kind and that it ought normally to leave these matters to the supervisor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that unless something of that kind is written in to the Bill, the court will have no guidance as to the circumstances in which it would use the ordinary powers in subsection (2) and in which circumstances it should go to the extreme length of using its powers, including requirement of an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will address himself to that point, rather than to the general supervision order power, and that he will consider the matter again in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond briefly to what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said. He is quite right in saying that the second amendment bites upon what he has described as the second limb of the clause. I do not believe that there is a distinction in principle here which makes it proper to accept the effect of this amendment on the second limb where it would not be proper on the first— in other words, to impose a fetter upon the court's power where it is writing its own condition into a supervision order, rather than in the more general case where it makes a supervision order at large and leaves the regime to the selection of the supervising officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think, as I have indicated, that it is right that courts should have the power to write certain conditions as to regime or other matters into a supervising order. The Magistrates' Association, among others, has asked for this and attaches a great deal of importance to it. I think that the absence of such a power is partly responsible for the alarming decline in the numbers of supervision orders in recent years, although their decline in some parts of the country has begun to be reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the purpose of the measure, but the courts are not able to write in such a condition under the provisions of clause 19, taking the material for it out of the air, as it were. First of all, they must consult the supervisor, as we know, and must also satisfy themselves statutorily that the requirements that they have in mind are necessary to secure the good conduct of the offender or to prevent him from re-offending. They must also secure the consent of the offender—or if he is a child, of his parent or guardian—so there wil be a process of discussion and agreement about the most appropriate and effective way of dealing with the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have illustrated the disadvantages of making this the second—and the most important—limb of their power so far as policy is concerned, since it really lies behind clause 19, but I do not believe that anything that I have said about making that conditional upon the courts recognising that otherwise they would have made a custodial sentence of one kind or another is diminished by what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, I believe, many circumstances in which it would be entirely proper for the courts to use this new procedure of writing in a particular condition or conditions into the supervision order, after consultation, with the agreement of the youngster or of his parent or guardian. I could envisage many circumstances in which that would be appropriate, when they would not be satisfied and would otherwise want to make a custodial order. It would not be wise to say to the courts " This is the only circumstances in which we wish you to make use of this new power ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the point with which I began, about the impossibility of checking whether they had gone through these mental procedures but I do not think, in terms of policy, that anything that the right hon. and learned Gentleman, or the hon. and learned Gentleman, has said has diminished the force of this substantial point. I do not think that I would add
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
to its force by repeating it. I have listened carefully to what has been said, but I cannot advise the Committee that this would be a fetter that it would be right to impose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. and learned Gentleman's objections to the first amendment. I concede that there is a danger in apparently giving the supervisor—to use colloquial language—a final say rather than the magistrate. Clearly, the final say as to what should be in the supervision order should be up to the magistrate. I accept that, but for the life of me, even though the Minister is capable of explaining matters explicitly and in simpler language than most people, I cannot understand his objections to the second amendment, on which I did not speak at the opening, because I intended to leave something for my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend has, as is his custom, dealt with it very cogently. Its purpose is simply to carry out the Government's intentions, and it would help to carry out the Government's intentions—namely, to ensure that the new supervised activities should only be used as a genuine alternative to custody—by restricting its use to cases in which the court would otherwise have passed a custodial sentence or a care order. That is the whole purpose of the exercise. This does not, in my view, fewer the courts in the way that the hon. and learned Gentleman suggests. However, like him, we feel that it would not serve any useful purpose by further debating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, while I do not wish to press amendment No. 43, I wish to press amendment No. 44. I do not know whether that can be done, Mr. Dean. If it can, that is the course I propose to adopt. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 43.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the proposals in the clause, which empower the courts to impose supervised activities requirements on juvenile offenders, as yet another important step forward in giving the courts greater confidence in using intermediate treatment schemes as a genuine alternative to a custodial sentence, particularly at the heavy end of the delinquent spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, of course, has constantly made references, though he has not yet produced the evidence, for the assertion that the magistracy in particular seems to be losing confidence in alternatives to custody. The clause, and the proposals in it, should help to restore that confidence, if the Minister is correct in his assertion that it has been eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the development of intermediate treatment schemes and alternatives to custody of this type should, I submit, be central to any policy for juveniles or young offenders, and should be a far more prominent part of the Bill than they are at present. Their aim, which presumably we all share, is to reduce the level of juvenile delinquency, and the level of offending. There is some evidence to suggest that intermediate treatment schemes can play an important and constructive part in reducing the level of offending among juveniles. It helps, for example, in that many of them deal with constructive acitivites, that help to develop social skills in what may be inarticulate, and somewhat deprived and often disadvantaged juvenile offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They help with counselling, and bring them into better relationship with mature adults. In particular they try to ensure that parents also are involved in supervised intermediate treatment schemes, so that they also accept at least some sense of responsibility both for what their child has done and for the supervised activities in the intermediate treatment scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those seem very desirable objectives, which we all ought to support, and they are achieved at considerably less cost than the custodial alternatives. The cost varies from £100 or less per child per year in the less sophisticated schemes, up to as much as £2,000, or £10,000 per child per place in the more intensive intermediate treatment schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Conservative Members are, however, frightened off, the whole concept of intermediate treatment by the £4,000 per place per year figure, it is worth reminding them, and the Committee, that it costs something like £10,000 per year per place in a local authority community home of education. The figure for borstal is £7,823, and a detention centre place, at the lower end, or minimum standard of the spectrum, costs as much as £6,505 per year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of that, and of what I have said, that intermediate treatment can be highly sophisticated, and clearly relevant to the individual juvenile's needs. In spite of the fact that it is considerably cheaper than the custodial alternatives, it is rarely used nationally as a direct alternative to custody. Part
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
of the problem with developing intermediate treatment is that perhaps it is not used as often as it should be as a direct alternative to a custodial placement. For that reason, the all-party Penal Affairs Group recommended in its report, " Young Offenders —A Strategy for the Future ", in paragraph 61, that
	<br><blockquote><p>" there should be a range of intermediate treatment catering both for young offenders and those at risk. Within this range, greater efforts should be made to provide intermediate treatment for juveniles who would otherwise have been committed to custodial and residential establishments."</p></blockquote>
At present, when a court makes a supervision order, it can confer on the supervisor the power to direct the young person to attend an intermediate treatment facility. However, at present it is for the supervisor himself to decide whether, and to what extent, the individual will attend the intermediate treatment scheme, and to what extent the facilities may be used. The White Paper, " Young Offenders ", summarised the present position fairly in paragraph 49, when it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Generally, except where there is very close liaison, the magistrates do not necessarily know what, if anything, will happen under the order. They might for that reason understandably hesitate to make a supervision order, particularly in the case of a serious or difficult offender ".</p></blockquote>
It is for that reason that the Magistrates Association has now been advocating for a considerable time that legislation should be introduced actually to direct that the child will have to undergo intermediate treatment, and to require that the supervisor ensures that that recommendation is carried out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its report, the all-party Penal Affairs Group endorsed the recommendation of the Magistrates Association. In paragraph 67 we said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that, before imposing an intermediate treatment requirement, the court should satisfy itself that the programme envisaged by the social worker or probation officer is appropriate. We further recommend that intermediate treatment requirements should be mandatory and their implementation should not be left to the supervisor's discretion. However, discretion should be given to the supervising officer to modify the detailed content of the intermediate treatment programme in the light of changing circumstances."</p></blockquote>
The provisions of this clause are substantially in line with our recommendation and, of course, for that reason if for no other, I welcome them. I consider that the usefulness, however, of these provisions will be limited unless much greater financial commitment is made to local authorities, the probation services and the voluntary organisations, to develop intermediate treatment schemes. They can be developed. They can be used by the courts, only if that finance is made available. Perhaps I will have the opportunity, if I catch your eye, Mr. Dean, to develop that argument in the " clause stand part " debate on clause 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the hon. and learned Gentleman will acknowledge that while he and I and everyone else say that there ought to be a shift from custody to non-custodial alternatives in the community, and while we accept that intermediate treatment is, if not the most important, at least one of the most important alternatives, it is receiving only a derisory amount of financial support from the Government.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
It is receiving considerably less than is entailed in the Bill as the cost of the new custodial measures. I speak particularly, of course, of residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like briefy to give an example of a particularly intensive intermediate treatment scheme that has gained a great deal of confidence from magistrates in a certain area. I am sure the Minister knows about this. Having described that scheme I shall ask him certain questions about the extent to which the approach I want to describe, which is in line with clause 19, might also be applied throughout the country, and in particular to those of an older age group than the under-17s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme I have in mind is the Medway Close Support Unit for juvenile offenders, run by the Kent Probation and After-Care Service. I notice that the Minister acknowledged the fact that he is familiar with the scheme. It is financed by the Kent Social Services Department. The unit provides a form of intensive intermediate treatment for juvenile offenders who in every case—I emphasise the words " in every case "—would otherwise receive a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That answers the point made during our first debate by the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir Nicholas Bonsor), who made the valid point that we cannot always compare the recividist rate for custodial treatment with those for community service orders or other community-based facilities. He made the point that often the community-based facilities do not take the more delinquent offenders. Here we have an example where they do. In that context, the matter is important and relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The children attend the unit for a 14-week period. On weekdays they go to school or work during the day, and if for some reason they are not attending school or work, they attend the probation service's day centre, which is located in the same building as the close support unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the school or working day, the evening is occupied with positive activities. It may be school homework, handicrafts or sports, either in the building or in supervised excursions outside. These activities in the evening continue until 8.30 p.m. when the young people go home and the unit staff make visits later in the evening to some of the children's homes to ensure that parents as well are properly and fully informed about what is happening, that they are involved in the work both of the unit and of the child and know full well of the children's progress. On Saturdays between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. the children carry out work of value to the community or again involve themselves in supervised leisure pursuits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. While I accept the worth of the centre and the community service systems as methods of appropriate punishment in some cases and of rehabilitation, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that the detention centres were more effective in so far as they did not have the same level of recidivism when they were able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
take children before they had committed a whole number of offences. Now, when they have children who have committed far more offences before they are sent there, recidivism has risen sharply. I still feel that the point I made originally was valid—that custodial sentences would be more effective if they were imposed earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be, but I am not prepared at this stage to argue that particular point with the hon. Gentleman. The point we were arguing about before, which is still relevant today —we can only deal with today's figures—is whether or not there is evidence to suggest that a custodial sentence is any more effective in producing reoffending than a sentence carried out within the community. The figures that are available to us all suggest that a custodial sentence is not effective in reducing recidivism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the 48 young offenders who attended the Medway Close Support Unit during the first year of its operation—I have emphasised this to the hon. Member for Nantwich—all of whom would have otherwise received a custodial sentence, only 20 per cent, committed a further offence in the year after they had been in the unit. As a result of the success of that particular scheme, the confidence engendered in the magistracy by its operation and the acknowledgment that it is not a soft option but a highly effective way of diverting young people from re-offending, the Kent probation service has more recently established a similar unit for offenders aged 17 and over. That fact leads me to the question I wish to put to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the Kent probation service's projects, the Magistrates' Association has asked that consideration be given to what they term " day imprisonment" as an alternative to custody for certain groups of petty offenders who currently receive custodial sentences. The Magistrates' Association has suggested that the courts should first decide on a custodial sentence and should then decide if it could appropriately be served on a day-time basis in special " day prisons ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It suggests that " day prisons", should be run by the Prison Department and should provide a constructive programme of activities which offenders would attend six days a week. It has, therefore, asked the Home Office to undertake a feasibility study to consider how such " day prisons " might be set up and run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the framework proposed by the Magistrates' Association is the right one. For example, I do not know whether it is most appropriate to ask the Prison Department to run these organisations and be responsible for the facilities or whether we should instead concentrate on building up the kind of project pioneered by the Kent Probation and After-Care Service by encouraging other probation areas to develop similar schemes and to follow the same kind of approach. Perhaps we could do both. I am sure that we should, however, look at some of the characteristics of the more successful of the intermediate treatment schemes. These could perhaps be used for an older age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
I am equally sure that any reasonable proposal for an alternative to custody put forward by a responsible body such as the Magistrates' Association should at least be fully, fairly and carefully considered. I hope that the Minister will be able to give some kind of assurances about the nature of the feasibility study which the Magistrates' Association has requested to be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps he will take this opportunity to respond to the general thrust of the proposals implemented by the Kent Probation and After-Care Service and the Kent Social Services Department and also respond perhaps to the idea floated by the Magistrates' Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what has been said by the hon. Gentleman on this part of the Bill, and particularly for the welcome he gave to this clause, which gives greater control to the courts over what shall happen to a young offender who is made the subject of a supervision order. As to a falling off in the confidence of the courts in respect of the intermediate treatment that takes place following the making of a supervision order, it is relevant to note that the use of supervision was only 16 per cent, of sentences for boys of 14 to 17 in 1980 compared with 22 per cent, for probation in 1970. There is some significant material in that comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Magistrates' Association—I readily endorse the hon. Gentleman's description of it as a highly responsible and informed body—to the enlargement of their control in this clause is itself probably significant when we are discussing the question of whether confidence has declined. Be that as it may, all of us agree that it should be restored and enhanced by the ability now to control what shall take place when a supervision order is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to intermediate treatment generally, I agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said. As it happens, the second engagement which I had to carry out, having to my surprise been translated to the Home Office in January last year, was the annual general meeting of the Intermediate Treatment Association—it may be a federation. I learnt a lot on that occasion and slightly surprised a good many of those present in the body of the kirk by my evident commitment to the principles of intermediate treatment and my belief in it as a genuine alternative to custodial sentence. I am not sure what they were expecting, but they seemed to be rather surprised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much endorse what the hon. Gentleman said about the need for parents to be involved in intermediate treatment, that they should accept some responsibility for the operation of intermediate treatment schemes and that they should accept some responsibility in proper cases for what their children have done. We shall come, as the hon. Gentleman said, in due course to a discussion of the financial support for these schemes, so I do not think it is appropriate for me to take time over that aspect of the matter now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to what the hon. Gentleman has said about the Medway Close Support Unit. I know about that
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
unit. I had the good fortune to visit it not long ago. Under the direction of Mr. Sussex who has been in charge of it from the beginning—notwithstanding that Kent generally leads the way in these matters— it has given great encouragement to those of us who believe that intermediate treatment has a great part to play, provided that it is applied and directed in a discriminating way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance about the close support unit is that the courts have confidence in it. They only send to it what in the trade is called the heavy end— that is important—and I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the value of staff checking in the evenings to see that the youngsters with whom they are dealing are at home and that their parents know and are taking part in the operation of this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unit is supported by the courts and not only by the magistrates but by the Crown courts in Kent because they recognise that this is by no means a soft option and that encouraging results are obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I readily give my endorsement, in response to the hon. Gentleman's invitation, to the unit, although it must be remembered that it is expensive in terms of resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, one would expect the Minister to know about the Kent scheme, and he has made some highly approving comments about it. Wil he go further and say that the same kind of scheme could be deployed throughout the rest of the country, if his Government were prepared to back it with the appropriate financial resources? If he will, we can make a reality of the objective that we supposedly all share of ensuring that more juveniles are dealt with in the community and that fewer are dealt with in custodial establishments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is tempting me on to ground which he himself will wish to cover at a later stage. I do not want him to cover it now. Had we unlimited resources, we could all think of things that would be very nice to do and not only nice but very useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come to that later, but certainly it has to be borne in mind that this unit is necessarily pretty heavy on resources and that its success derives in no small part from the high proportion of staff to offenders deployed there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has waxed lyrical about this scheme, oddly enough, and I know he believes in it and is familiar with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it not be sensible for his Department to issue, at the expense of the Home Office, a copy of the details of the scheme which has been issued by the social services department of Kent county council explaining the advantage of the scheme and explaining the methods? Would that not be of great help to other local authorities which seek to set up intermediate schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall want to see how it develops but it is a suggestion for which I am grateful and which we can consider.

The hon. Member for Ormskirk touched on the proposal of the Magistrates' Association for a scheme of day imprisonment. Should it be imprisonment, as the association stresses, or should it be a kind of probation, or part of probation, similar to the Med way scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That there should be an increased use of sentences served in the community, but under close supervision, is widely agreed. How much we can achieve is dependent upon resources. But we are discussing the proposal for day imprisonment which the Magistrates' Association has made. We are discussing that with the association. It is a suggestion which certainly merits discussion. We have not reached the point of deciding whether we can do a feasibility study, but.it is an interesting and important suggestion It is, of course, designed for an older age group than the group we are concerned with in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with the matters raised in the debate, and I do not wish to delay longer the point which I believe we have now reached when we can agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 21, line 19, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>" (2A) It shall be the duty of a local authority to establish in accordance with regulations made under subsection (2B) below a body to be called the children's local consultative committee which the local authority shall consult as to the arrangements for the provision of facilities under this section.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2B) The Secretary of State may make regulations as to the membership and operation of children's local consultative committees.".</p></blockquote>
I could move the amendment very briefly but I am a little timorous about so doing because, if my speech is too brief, I may have to move the proposed amendments to clause 2 which were put on the Notice Paper at the last minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to make it a statutory responsibility of all local authorities to establish proper consultative committees composed of all those organisations which have to deal with young offenders to advise on local arrangements for the provision of facilities for juvenile offenders and to encourage the development of a properly, coordinated and consistent policy towards such offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper on Young Offenders was full-some in its desire that there should be greater cooperation between the various organisations involved. Paragraph 36 says that the Government cannot emphasise too strongly the importance that they attach to such local co-operation, and paragraph 37
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
says that it is by increased consultation and coordination of this kind that effective progress is likely to be made in containing and reducing juvenile crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Committee will be familiar with the work undertaken by NACRO's community alternatives for young offenders' projects. This demonstrated that substantial and considerable benefits flowed from the setting up and from the proper working of such a co-ordinated approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It brings together the police, with their responsibilities for detection and caution; the local authority social services and education departments, whose resources are essential in providing the actual community facilities; and the probation service and the courts which have the responsibility for sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through this system of working together—and it is a very desirable objective—proper information on needs can be shared and a much better understanding between the various organisations of the different roles that they play can be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper encourages such a co-operative approach, but it turns its back on legislation and says that such legislation could damage the existing machinery. I do not know the reasoning behind that. I should have thought that the most likely effect of making it a statutory obligation would be to serve to consolidate and to buttress the established practice of co-operation between the various agencies, and to ensure its introduction throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that some areas have established bodies along the lines that I have advocated. But it is unlikely that most of those which have not will do so by mere encouragement from whatever source it comes—even so persausive a source as the Minister. Can the Minister enlighten us about how many bodies have set up such co-ordinated organisations? If he is not able to supply the information now, perhaps he will do so later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Minister. It is in line with his desired objective, and I believe that it is an amendment the spirit of which the Committee would support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment would be to require local authorities to establish a children's local consultative committee which the authority would consult about arrangements for providing intermediate treatment facilities. The Secretary of State would be empowered to make regulations about the membership and operation of the committees. Perhaps a word of background might be of help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20 transfers from children's regional planning committees to local authorities the duty to make arrangements for the provision of intermediate treatment facilities. The local authority will be required, whether
	<br><blockquote><p>" acting individually or in association with other local authorities, to make arrangements with such persons as appear to them to be appropriate, for the provision by those persons "</p></blockquote>
of intermediate treatment facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
Facilities can be provided by local authorities, probation committees or others, for example, voluntary bodies or individuals. Schedule 9 will allow probation and after-care committees to provide such facilities for the first time from their own resources. The provision of intermediate treatment facilities which are responsive to local needs will help to strengthen the confidence of the courts in supervision, and the transfer of responsibility for making arrangements from the regional planning committees to local authorities will, we believe, assist in achieving this aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the amendment moved by the hon. and learned Gentleman is to ensure that at local level agencies concerned with juveniles are consulted about the arrangements for providing I.T. facilities. I referred to what will be done by clause 20. I think that the new provision under clause 20, namely, that these arrangements are made only after consultation between local authorities and the relevant probation and after-care committees, is important. The provision has been included in order to reflect the significant role played by the probation service in the supervision of juvenile offenders. Other agencies concerned with young people are also involved in providing I.T. facilities, and these facilities will in future, as in the past, be provided either by the local authority or by the probation committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not favour the idea of a statutory requirement to consult. The White Paper has been referred to. In paragraph 37, we made clear our view that statutory consultative machinery can do as much to harm existing satisfactory local arrangements as to encourage co-operation where none exists. In so far as the intention of the amendment is to promote local co-operation—and that is its intention—naturally we are entirely in sympathy with it—that is, co-operation between the bodies particularly concerned with young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will have been noted by the Committee, however, that we already go quite a long way in that direction in the Bill. I referred to the provision of clause 20 that requires consultation between local authorities and the relevant probation and after-care committees about providing intermediate treatment. This requirement is included in the Bill in recognition of the role which the probation service plays in the supervision of juvenile offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, however, goes a good deal further than that in providing a new statutory framework. We said in paragraph 37 of the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Statutory requirements for the formation of specific consultative machinery may do … much to harm existing satisfactory local arrangements ".</p></blockquote>
Their purpose, of course, would be to encourage consultation where none exists, but I think we have met the need to encourage it in what we propose in clause 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We continued in paragraph 37:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The Government therefore intends to continue to do everything possible to encourage inter-agency co-operation at a local level without imposing any centralised formula."</p></blockquote>
We know of local consultative committees in a number of areas. For example, they are established
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
in Norfolk, Leicester, Exeter, Doncaster and Rotherham, and I understand that many other areas are considering the setting up of such committees. I think it is really a matter of preference, but we strongly prefer the local voluntary, co-operative pattern to the pattern of a statutory framework. We think it is much more likely to meet local needs and conditions if it is voluntary than if it is imposed by Parliament from the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That explains what I acknowledge at first may have appeared a surprising resistance to this amendment. We shall promote local co-operation wherever possible, but we do not see great merit in burdening the local authorities with the new responsibility of setting up these statutory committees. I hope that I have explained in a sensible way what it is that leads us to look upon this amendment without the degree of favour that the hon. and learned Gentleman was hoping for. I am afraid that for those reasons I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister took the view that he did on this amendment, because I think there is a major problem in relation to intermediate treatment. It is not specified as a penalty in any document or in any statutory enactment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people talk about supervision orders, they tend to think of them as a children's version of probation orders. The courts do not see them as a means of working within a set regime to improve the capacity of the child to adapt to its circumstances and not to get into crime again. I am pretty certain that one of the reasons why supervision orders have not been used as well as they ought to have been—and here I agree with the Minister—is that they are not, so to speak, up front in terms of the courts' perceptions of what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that is also partly true of the social service committees of the local authorities in determining the allocation of expenditure on social service matters. Most of the intermediate treatment centres depend upon local authority allocations, and they are under no statutory obligation to provide intermediate centres. Among the broad range of projects that a social service committee has to consider it will not necessarily feature very high in its list of priorities. I understand that last year £2,200,000 was spent on intermediate treatment by the local authorities in England and Wales. In my own county of North Yorkshire, £8,000 was spent. In Lambeth, £370,000 was spent. I can see that hon. Members might very easily argue that in those circumstances it is appropriate to make that disparity, because North Yorkshire may not have the same kind of juvenile delinquency problem that they have in Lambeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Hackney, the total spent by the local authority on intermediate treatment last year was £13,000, and the total amount spent in Haringey was £256,000. The two areas must be similar in relation to juvenile offenders, both being inner city areas with ethnic minority difficulties, yet there is this huge disparity between what they spend in one area on these treatment centres and what they spend in another.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that if they had to come together in some kind of organised way within the local authority, and taken in the voluntary sector as well to try to work out a pattern of how they provide for intermediate centres, it would be useful. Therefore, I thought that my hon. Friend's scheme had that merit—namely, not simply that it promoted co-operation but it actually raised the priority with which the local authority looked upon its spending allocation in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are plenty of other ways in which this can be done. One of the most important ways would be for the Government to push the fact—possibly by circular when the Bill is enacted—that this is a major aspect of spending and that it may be more desirable than spending on new prisons or borstals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am delighted to know that they are that much out of date though, as I hope to say on the next clause, when we compare what we spend on intermediate treatment centres and what we spend on borstals or on community homes, there is a false priority in the amount we allocate. For that reason I am sorry that the Minister cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to what the Minister said. His objectives are clearly in line with the spirit behind the amendment, and it is clearly desirable that all local authorities should set up such bodies on which all organisations—or agencies, to use a phrase which I dislike—should be represented. In the circumstances, as the Minister's objective is the same as mine, and having regard to the detailed reply the hon. and learned Gentleman has given, the amendment is not one that I wish to press. I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 22, line 18, leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>" the court making it is satisfied that ".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 60, in page 22, line 37, leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>" the court making the order is satisfied that".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The laudable purpose of this amendment and amendment No. 60 is to do two simple things—to take unnecessary words out of the clause and, secondly, to set at rest any conceivable ambiguity arising by virtue of their presence there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
The clause enables schemes to be made, and makes certain provisions in subsection (12), requiring compliance with directions of a supervision order. As I understand it, a supervision order shall not require compliance with directions under section 12(2) of the Act unless a scheme is in force in the area where the supervised person resides or will reside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar provision is made in subsection (13). The two subsections refer to whether the court making the order is satisfied that a scheme under this section is in force. The position seems to me absolutely clear, that either there is a scheme or there is not. If the intention of the subsections is to make sure that there is a scheme before the direction can be made, it is sufficient to say, " Unless a scheme under this section is in force ". The words
	<br><blockquote><p>" the court making the order is satisfied "</p></blockquote>
are superfluous in both subsection (12) and subsection (13).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, it is intended that those words should add anything to the clause, the only addition that they could possibly make would be to cater for circumstances where, although no scheme is in force, the court is satisfied that there is—a somewhat unlikely eventuality, but one which we certainly ought not to cater for in the terms of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government did not intend that sort of construction of the subsections to be the right one. I am sure that they either meant that scheme is in force, in which case the power arises, or no scheme is in force, in which case it does not arise. If that is what they mean, these words can be taken out without any damage to the effect of the two subsections, with the beneficial result that unnecessary verbiage and any possible ambiguity are removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for the textual care that he has devoted to this matter. I entirely sympathise with his desire that we should not include something in the Bill that is not necessary. I am all for cutting out surplus words', as I am sure the hon. Member for Ormskirk is, whether written or oral. Nor do I want the court to have to ask itself whether it is satisfied that something that is not there is there. However, I am not persuaded that this is surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should certainly like to look at it again in the light of what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said. I do not think that it can be said that the words that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would delete serve no function at all. Clauses 19 and 20 re-enact existing provisions, but give them a new tenor. We want to try to restore the confidence of the courts in the supervision order, as we have said. One of the ways of doing so is to involve them more closely in what actually happens to a juvenile who is under supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20 sets out the arrangements for establishing schemes of activities, including the date by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
which schemes should come into force, and provisions for revoking or amending schemes. These admit of the possibility that there may from time to time be parts of the country where there is no scheme in force at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Courts, therefore, should be fully aware of what is going on in their own neighbourhood, and if necessary should make inquiries about what is available in the neighbourhood where a juvenile will reside. If a court in, for example, Ormskirk, is dealing with a juvenile offender who lives in Dulwich, it should satisfy itself that a scheme is in force in Dulwich before making a supervision order requiring the juvenile to comply with directions given by his supervisor. That is really the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words used in the new section 19 make it clear that the duty to obtain any necessary information about schemes rests with the court itself. That prevents it from simply acting on the assumption that schemes are in force in Dulwich and elsewhere all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that we should not put in something that is not necessary. It is in order to give a flavour to the obligation of the courts that the words are there. We should like to look at what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said. If he is satisfied with that assurance, possibly the most convenient way would be for him to withdraw the amendment. I hope that he will so that we may proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the example that the Minister gave, of course, there must be a scheme in Dulwich.
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
A court in Ormskirk—ingenious as I am sure that all courts in Ormskirk are—would not satisfy itself that there is a scheme in Dulwich unless there was a scheme in Dulwich. I cannot see how the words in question add anything either to the duty of a court or to the situation which it is intended to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister has promised to look at this momentous question again with all the advice that he can get from the draftsmen and many other quarters. I am sure that when he has done so, at the next stage of the Bill he will come forward with an identical amendment to mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the light of his promise, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Dean. At our last session the right hon. and learned Gentleman observed that he hoped there would be some flexibility in the use made of the sittings motion, and I replied that this would be dealt with through the usual channels. Today we are in the happy position of having made substantial progress. We are also in the not-so-happy position of now having to deal with substantial new selections. Although the Government are always prepared for these matters, we understand that others are not so adequately served, and it may be convenient if the Committee now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
