</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will readily appreciate that the Opposition amendments are essentially probing ones to provide for a discussion on a number of matters. As the Opposition made clear on Second Reading, we have no objection to the Bill in principle. The purpose of our amendments is to examine a number of aspects of the proposals and what lies behind them. The Under-Secretary of State, replying to the Second Reading debate, shared
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
in the frankness for which his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is so well known in the House when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main purpose of the Bill is simply and straightforwardly to increase the borrowing limits of British Airways and the British Airports Authority".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 16 November 1981; vol. 12, c. 83.] </p></blockquote>
I look forward to that frankness and simplicity being shared by many of his right hon. and hon. Friends when they introduce Bills to increase the borrowing limits of public corporations and nationalised industries. The Bill shows that on occasions even the present Government are able to recognise that increased borrowing limits of public corporations and nationalised industries are not to be sneered at or derided but are firmly based on reasonable needs. It contrasts with the need of his right hon. Friend to chastise one of his hon. Friends who saw fit to be more critical of these public corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first inquiry is to ask why the increase is required. Hon. Members will appreciate that at the time of the Second Reading I was not aware of the close interest that I should be taking in these matters. My knowledge is therefore gleaned from reading the Second Reading debate. It did not become so clear, as I think might have been the case, why the borrowing limits were being increased. The only detail mentioned was the expenditure of £10 million at a Scottish airport. Other large sums of money appeared to have slipped into broad headings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of the investment programme over five or six years is about £700 million, a certain amount of which is to be financed by the increased borrowing limits. It is remarkable, reading the annual report of the British Airports Authority, to discover how much of that sum has been taken up by a limited number of major proposals and how some of that spending depends on decisions yet to be firmly taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that Ministers were at pains to explain to the House that the borrowing limits for which approval was sought did not themselves imply a firm decision to do certain things. One decision that will have to be taken in due course is that relating to Stanstead. The increased borrowing limit that we are asked to approve amounts to about £175 million in total, although I appreciate that the second tranche will depend upon an affirmative order of the House. That seems to amount to about 25 per cent, of the investment programme. I should like to know if the 25 per cent.: 75 per cent, ratio of borrowing limit expansion in aggregate and the size of the investment programme is coincidental. A substantial argument is taking place in various places about the implications of the need for a very large amount of self-financing. I shall touch upon those matters during my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other reference I have seen relating to this issue is a statement by Mr. Payne that he, as a matter of practice, was aiming at a 70 to 75 per cent, internally generated financing programme. I wonder why that sort of proportion is the aim. The implication of the need to find 70 to 75 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
internally is that charges have to be raised to provide finance. I suspect that many private industrial companies would not aim at 70 to 75 per cent, minimum self-financing. Those are the kinds of figures that the British Airports Authority has been practising so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of issues arise. My right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith) pointed out on Second Reading that yet again the present generation of consumers was paying for use, by future generations. An even wider issue that arises is the reason why current profits of the Brtsh Airports Authority are not used to pay some kind of dividend to the tax-paying shareholders. As the Under-Secretary of State will recall this was developed at some length in paragraphs 10 to 18 of the Public Accounts Committee's report last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Accounts Committee suggested to the Department that the financial structure and the way in which the business conducted itself should take into account the need to pay the taxpayer or the shareholders—that is, us—some of the money back from time to time. That argument was resisted by the Department and to some extent, remarkably, by the Treasury. I often wonder whether Governments, always view nationalised industries and public corporations with that in mind. If the intention is to do anything more than break even, in line with the practice of private commercial companies, part of the present profits should come back to the taxpayer. It would mean that a larger part of the current financing of the investment programme should justifiably be financed by borrowing. We know that that argument does not always make sense, but it is the kind of practice that I suspect the British Airports Authority would have to follow if it were privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems that we face in discussing the pricing policy of the British Airports Authority is the existence at present of the litigation that is proceeding. That will make the analysis of arguments difficult. However, it would be most unfortunate if we were unable to explore the matter considerably further than we did on Second Reading. At the start of that debate, the Secretary of State appeared to offer more hope in that respect than did the Under-Secretary when he replied. It would be unfortunate if the House and the Com-mitttee were asked to approve a substantial increase in borrowing limits, yet be unable to ask the questions and get the answer on issues about which law suits are pending. The Opposition have no wish to hold up the Bill or prevent the necessary financing, but at the same time we insist on asking the questions that we feel need to be asked, and we hope that the Under-Secretary will be more forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer, first, to the 6 per cent, rate of return on a current cost accounting basis. In the circumstances of the present recession, that is a significant and substantial rate of return. Indeed, the vast bulk of British industry would be delighted to have that rate of return. Does the Under-Secretary feel that there has been some inflexibility in the way that the British Airports Authority has been asked to pursue that target? Why has that target of 6 per cent, in current cost accounting been adhered to in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
the current climate of the civil aviation industry, and how does it compare with the returns that are being earned in the private sector? My impression is that in the private sector a rate of return of 2 per cent, is more the order of the day. Yet the British Airports Authority is trying to achieve a rate much higher than that, and as a consequence, it has had to raise its landing charges substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landing charges have aroused much feeling among airport users, not only because of the impact on airlines and their customers, but also because of the possibility of an impact on the location of flights and so on. I shall only say, in parentheses, that it is another example of the situation into which the Government have got themselves with nationalised industries and public corporations. The Government want to contain inflation, and to do so they control the money supply. That was the story two years ago, but it was not mentioned much in the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday. The Chancellor started by asking all bis Departments to ensure that the nationalised industries and the public corporations did not make losses, and, if they were making profits, that they made them bigger. For the British Airports Authority, the best way to fight inflation has been to raise prices, and people, faced by depression and a serious recession, have a double reason for resenting these rising prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an analogy here with the gas industry which, like the British Airports Authority, has grounds for feeling resentment for being blamed for having to increase prices. It has got all the stick, and is even being taken through the courts for policies which I suspect it does not completely endorse. So it appears that the British Airports Authority, as a consequence of having to finance a certain proportion of its investment through internally generated funds, will have to raise prices substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary tell us what is the current intention in the next round of charges It would be unfortunate—I make no comment on the current litigation—if next year's fight against inflation were accompanied by a further big increase in charges by the public corporations. What are the Under-Secretary's intentions in this connection Is it still the intention to put the British Airports Authority in the position of having substantially to raise landing charges yet again? The figure that has been mentioned is 12 per cent., which is well above the optimistic view of inflation that was given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday. It would mark a significant increase in the real prices charged by yet another public corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that if the British Airports Authority has to confine its borrowing within the limits that are being set in the clause, which we seek to amend, it will have to raise charges considerably. It is reasonable to ask what are the implications of the limits being set here for those charges. It is not ironic that just over the river a Labour-controlled Greater London Council is being taken to court for having bus fares that are too low, yet here a public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
corporation airline is being taken to court because a Tory Government are making it charge prices that are alleged to be too high? One can take one's pick. I shall not comment on the latter, but I shall say what I believe about the former.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other way round, I hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people may say that the courts should keep their noses out of such matters, but they have been involved for better or for worse. I recognise that the matter is sub judice, but the irony will not have escaped people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many criticisms of public corporations. I was delighted to read the support given by the Secretary of State during the Second Reading debate on 16 November. He chastised his hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, North-West (Mr. Grylls) and said that he hoped that his hon. Friend would
	<br><blockquote><p>"not join those who carelessly toss around accusations about the efficiency of public-sector corporations." — [	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 November 1981; Vol. 13, c. 43.] </p></blockquote>
Many Opposition Members would say "Hear, hear" to that. In the brief time that I have considered these matters, I have been impressed by the record of the British Airports Authority, but being impressed by its record and management should never prevent us from asking questions about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the Under-Secretary of State, in replying to the Second Reading debate, made something of the point that there had been two further financial objectives set for the British Airports Authority. That was offered as an explanation of the way in which the Government were making sure that the British Airports Authority was pursuing efficiency and effectiveness to the full. That stone into the pond was not new. Exactly the same point was made in the public expenditure White Paper earlier this year—that those two performance indicators had been established—and the same point was made in the Public Accounts Committee report in July 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three questions about the Public Accounts Committee's Twentieth report of July 1980. First, since that report, what has happened to its two target aims in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6? To what extent have those targets been monitored since they were established, and what conclusions does the Minister reach on that basis? What is his forecast for the next year or two?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there was reference in the PAC report to the development of further aims which, it was hoped, would especially reflect the interests of consumers, as it was put in paragraph 6. What has the Department done about examining and drawing up other performance aims for the British Airports Authority since the spring and summer of last year, and can the Under-Secretary of State tell us whether they are yet in operation? If so, what are they, and what is the aim?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the PAC also made the point that there should, despite the problems in doing it, be an attempt to draw up comparisons with overseas air-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
ports. I understand—althought obviously not yet as well as the Under-Secretary of State—some of the problems involved in making comparisons of airports. It is by no means a simple matter. Nevertheless, the PAC suggested that attention should be given to them. It asked that further efforts be made to secure information enabling valid comparisons to be made. I ask whether that has been done and, if so, what conclusions have been drawn? If it has not been done, why not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that today we shall have a rather firmer reaffirmation by the Under-Secretary of State than the Secretary of State seemed to be able to give in the Second Reading debate that there is no looming threat of privatisation or denationalisation of the British Airports Authority. The Under-Secretary of State smiles, but I recall the frivolous way in which the present Secretary of State for Employment disregarded the damage that would be done by launching a privatisation scheme for British Airways despite our warnings that it would not work and that it was nowhere near the right time. Nevertheless, the Government went on and got themselves deeper and deeper into problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the level of morale in British Airways or how the matter has affected people. I do not believe in talking down any organisation. That is of no purpose at all. Threats of major changes in ownership, unless they are carried out or unless the likely nature of them is well founded, should never be made. They should be put forward only with the greatest of care. That is the experience of private industry, and we have seen in recent months the growing alarm about the way in which companies can change ownership and the way in which that genuinely disturbs relations in the businesses affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), in the Second Reading debate, made what I believed to be an absolute classic statement of ideological prejudice the other way about the de-nationalisation or privatisation that had occurred. I hope that we shall have some clear reaffirmation from the Under-Secretary of State that he does not agree with his hon. Friend's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to approve the Bill, we must have some answers to questions about the financing of the British Airports Authority. Why has the figure of 6 per cent, been adhered to regardless of its effects upon landing charges and other costs? Does the Under-Secretary of State feel that the real charges must nevertheless keep rising in the foreseeable future, despite their impact upon airlines and prices and their small part in the effect on the cost of living? Why is the large amount of self-financing still to continue? Has the Minister acted in any further way during the past year upon the other areas for improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the British Airports Authority that could play some part in moderating the effects of rising prices and charges for an industry which, like so many, has faced some of the gravest problems it has had to face for many years, with rising oil prices, the recession and the general problems of the airline industry.

If we get some satisfactory answers, obviously we shall withdraw our amendment in due course. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State can go further today than he felt able on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer), you saw fit to group my own amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 9, leave out from "million" to end of line 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose behind my amendment is to carry further in some detail the argument which I advanced on Second Reading and to which the hon. Member for Batley and Morley referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it is not right that nationalised industries should come to the House of Commons to raise loan capital and extend their borrowing facilities by means of statutory instruments. The significance of my amendment would be to extend the borrowing facility of the British Airports Authority to the £200 million stipulated in clause 1(1) and not carry it further. Secondly, the £200 million limit, in my judgment, provides ample borrowing facilities for the authority to carry forward those of its current capital expenditure plans that need to be financed by borrowing while allowing it time to divest itself of either part of its capital by means of an infusion of equity through the market, or even to go further and seek to dispose of assets—probably whole airports—and to begin the process of denationalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more interested in denationalising the British Airports Authority because, in that way, we would get a competitive structure within United Kingdom airports which would be wholly beneficial to civil air transport. My amendment genuinely gives the British Airports Authority ample financial leeway to prepare itself for the issuing of a prospectus for the assets which it ought to divest. I am certain that there would be investors very glad to acquire certain airports in the United Kingdom which are now owned by the British Airports Authority. The authority has done well in recent years, and its latest annual report for the financial year 1980-81 gives eloquent testimony to its good management and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret the policy which has led the authority to finance so large a proportion of its capital programme from current revenue and that it has had to raise exorbitant landing and other charges to the civil airline operators. That is a mistaken policy. However, by and large, when the individual results are considered as a whole, the authority, according to its own lights, has not done too badly. That is because the airports have generally been well managed. Therefore they provide good opportunities for acquisition by the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I take Heathrow airport as an example because I know that best. That airport's profit almost doubled in the financial year 1980-81 against the profit achieved in the financial year 1979-80. The profit in 1980-81 doubled to £46-4 million. Even Gatwick airport has improved its position substan-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
tially; the loss in the financial year 1980-81 decreased to £1-6 million as against £4-2 million in the previous year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many regard the Scottish airports as perpetual loss makers, but I do not believe them to be so. Aberdeen airport has been singularly successful; the profit is up by almost £| million against a loss in the previous financial year of £1-4 million. From an aviation aspect, Prestwick airport has almost surpassed aviation facilities in Scotland, and the loss there is down to £800,000 as against £2-7 million the year before. Edinburgh airport has had a slight reduction of loss to £1-8 million as against £1-9 million, and the loss at Glasgow airport, most creditably, is down to £700,000 as against £2-6 million. Therefore, the trend in all the Scottish airports owned by the British Airports Authority is favourable and, in the case of Aberdeen airport, is so favourable as to lend itself to becoming a good prospect as an investment for a would-be acquirer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before that we need a competitive environment. We need Gatwick competing against Heathrow for air traffic. We would obviously like to see Abbotsinch competing against Prestwick and Edinburgh against Glasgow. If everything is done to maximise the commercial incentive of airport owners, the operators will get the best deal. So long as Glasgow airport remains in the same ownership as Prestwick and Abbotsinch in the same ownership as Turnhouse, that competitive incentive will not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is notable that in the United States the capital programmes for improvements and expansions of airports are financed usually by raising bond issues or even by the infusion of equity capital. That should be the process in the United Kingdom. The commencing capital and existing debt of the British Airways Authority is not over-large: it is some £52.9 million, subsequent loans amount to £8.58 million, and that is a total of £61 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The works envisaged and the future capital commitment of the British Airways Authority amounts to about £136.9 million, of which £45.8 million is not itemised in the annual report because it represents contracts already placed but not dealt with in the accounts. The gearing of the British Airways Authority is not unreasonable. Therefore, it lends itself to privatisation. However, the view that I express to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, with all seriousness, is that it is not a case so much of privatisation as of breaking up the authority into individually manageable units—preferably under different ownership—so that there is a genuinely competitive environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is modest and reasonable from a parliamentary aspect, and it is responsible. I do not believe in nationalised industries coming to the House for more and more money for extra borrowing by statutory instrument. The amendment would give us time to break up the British Airports Authority which, on the whole, has been well managed apart from its policy of financing capital development to such a large extent on current revenue. We should then see landing charges coming down, a

better deal for civil airline operators, more jobs and more importantly a better deal for the travelling public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr George Foulkes	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start with the good news for Government supporters. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer), I occupy my exalted place on the Opposition Front Bench on a temporary basis, in the unavoidable absence of one of my colleagues. I congratulate my hon. Friend on his elevation. Those hon. Members who sat with him on the Civil Aviation Bill know the expertise that he exhibited on that occasion, and we have seen him showing that again in his more exalted position today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition also congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Trade on his elevation. We all prefer to see him as a Government big gun, calvery man or light artillery man discussing airports. That is better than his being a sniper from the Back Benches on social security matters. The Minister's elevation is extremely acceptable to us, as it is to the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed and many other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Morley said about why our amendment proposes a reduced figure. I know that hon. Members and particularly you, Mr. Mitchell, know that it is not possible for the Opposition to propose what they would like—a higher figure—so we have to move an amendment proposing a lower figure in order to d	<div class='sup'>:</div> <!-- sup -->scuss the matter. I say that not for hon. Members here but in case there is any misunderstanding outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson)—in case as I go through other matters he thinks I have forgotten his appalling suggestion—that I shall return to his speech later in my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) will not find what I have to say too tedious and lengthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the major items included in the forecast of the capital development programme from 1981-82 up to 1985-86. This is a part of the annual report of the British Airports Authority which shows its priorities for spending the money which it will be allowed to borrow. I find the balance of expenditure between the airports in the south-east of England for which the authority has responsibility and the airports in Scotland for which it has responsibility quite appalling. I hope that we as a Committee, and the Government, will say to the Authority that it has the balance and its priorities wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the sums to be spent on Heathrow, Gatwick and the rest of the airports in the South-East are added together, they come to £585 million. I remind hon. Members, as did the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, that this sum is for only the South-East airports—albeit an important area—and not for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
provincial English airports which are under separate management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In comparison, only £11 million is being allocated to the four Scottish airports. Even Mr. Goschens, who worked out a great formula based on the population percentage apportioned between Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole, came up with the figures of 9, 10, or 11 per cent, of the total expenditure. That is comparing Scotland with the whole of the rest of the United Kingdom, while we were talking only about the south-east of England. I know that there is a travel pattern which allocates the south-east of England a special place, but I have some reservations about that. However, even allowing for that travel pattern, the sums that are proposed for the south-east of England are amazingly disproportionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry not to see the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) on the Government Benches. We all know that he has a great experience of aviation, not only going up but even more of coming down, and not always smoothly. It would be useful to have his expertise today because, apart from the Minister, who is constrained because he is a member of the Government from putting forward the usual vigorous case that he likes to present as a Scott	<div class='sup'>:</div> <!-- sup -->sh hon. Member, there is no other Scottish hon. Member on the Government side. Mind you, Mr. Mitchell, we compensate for that adequately on the Opposition side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire raised on Second Reading a number of matters effecting the Scottish airports, and I am sure that he agrees with me. I cannot see what we would like done in Scottish airports happening on the amount of money that is allocated by the British Airports Authority for Scotland. It is a strange balance when nearly as much is to be spent on roads and car parks alone at Heathrow as is to be spent on all the Scottish airports. That is an amazing comparison. There is more being spent on telephones at Heathrow than on Prestwick airport as a whole. That shows a strange sense of priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be implied, if not explicitly said in the annual report of the authority that nothing needs to be done in the Scottish airports. Nothing could be further from the truth as every hon. Member who uses these airports regularly will know. I have used nearly all of them in the past year or two. There is still a great deal that needs to be done. Those who travel regularly on the shuttle know that the facilities for shuttle passengers in both Edinburgh and Glasgow are still not adequate. I know they are not quite as appalling as they are in London, but that is not saying that they are adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground transport at Glasgow is an absolute mess. Something needs to be done to ensure that passengers coming into Glasgow airport know how to get to their various destinations. It is relatively easy to know how to get from Glasgow airport into the centre of Glasgow, although usually the predatory taxis are far nrre in evidence than the relatively infrequent airport buses. However, if, as my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
Lambie) and I have, one wants to get down to the Ayrshire line from Paisley Gilmour Street Station, there are no signs showing where to find public transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to relate what he is saying rather more closely to the amendment, otherwise we shall have a debate on transport all over the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not want that, Mr. Mitchell. I recall previous rigorous chairmanships, and will try to give only one or two examples of what I would like to see money spent on in Scotland. I trust I shall remain in order. I shall not mention too many examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This example is particulary bad. We are talking about encouraging the use and increasing the revenue or airports to ensure that less money needs to be found to finance them. One of the ways to make them more attractive is to make it easier for passengers to understand the links between, for example, Paisley Gilmour Street Station and the airport. Jt is appalling that there are no bus stops, no indica	<div class='sub'>:</div> <!-- sub --> tors—absolutely nothing—to show the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second example is nearer home at Prestwick airport, which is near Prestwick town station. However, there is no link between Prestwick station and Prestwick airport. There have been various suggestions for moving the railway station to the airport, because the railway line runs next to the airport. In the longer term, that might be a possibility. However, that would cause problems for the users of the railway station in the town. There are more of them than there are airport passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hundreds of millions of pounds are being spent in the south-east of England and if just a small fraction of that was spent on Prestwick, there could be a very efficient covered travelator service between Prestwick town station and the airport. It would greatly improve the attractiveness of Prestwick airport. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood has already made generous references to Prestwick airport. However, with respect to him and my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire, Prestwick needs investment to make it more attractive. We would like to see a covered travelator. If it can be done in Heathrow between terminals and between the Underground and each terminal, surely it can be done between Prestwick station and the airport. No money has been allocated for this sort of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Scottish airports the British Airports Authority has been asked to adopt a break-even policy. On the face of it, there seems to be an understandable rationale. If I understood the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood correctly, the method of arriving at that break-even point is open to question. It seems to be asking the Scottish airports to' bear a particularly unequal burden in terms of the revenue spent each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Asking each airport independently to' break even does not have the rationale that is necessary for fitting into a co-ordinated airports policy. Many of us would like to see a positive boost being given to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
the airports outside the South-East to make them more attractive to airline operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the work done by the Prestwick airport consultative committee and its Chairman, Mr. Graham Wiley. It has done enthusiastic work for the airport. In the annual report of the British Airports Authority, we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The committee discussed the level of landing charges at Prestwick, an opinion having been expressed that these militated against Prestwick in comparison with Heathrow."</p></blockquote>
That is the situation that has arisen. Instead of it being cheaper to land at Prestwick, thereby encouraging people away from the South-East of England towards Prestwick, the opposite is the case. Because of the break-even policy, the landing charges and navigation charges have to be raised. The level of use of the airport goes down. Fewer people use the airport, so the charges have to be raised, so even fewer people use the airport. Therefore, there is a downward spiral in the use of the airport because of the accounting policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister should give a positive boost to Prestwick by entering into discussions with selected airlines that have shown an interest in using the airport. They might be encouraged to use Prestwick if there were a major and substantial reduction in landing charges and navigational charges. There could be a positive boost for Prestwick airport. That is a sensible suggestion to try to get away from the downward spiral that is potentially endangering Prestwick airport and from the congestion in the South-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that most people are experiencing a great deal of congestion in the South-East. It is not just that dreadful, increasingly packed journey on the tube to Heathrow and all the cars crushed on the roads to Heathrow that are a nuisance. I understand that even Royal fliers are finding the airways congested around Heathrow at the moment. When that sort of danger looms, I should have thought that Conservative Members would be anxious, particularly if they are thinking of their future elevation, as no doubt they always do in their beds at night. I should have thought that they would be only too glad to encourage any move to get rid of the congestion in the South-East. Therefore, I hope that a positive suggestion will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made some appalling, amazing and outrageous suggestions. He comes to the Committee not as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, but almost as a putative salesman for the airports, putting them into an attractive package so that he can sell them to potential investors, many of whom are no doubt his friends. He lauds the way in which the airports are breaking even.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not the present trend appalling? We have seen it in British Rail, and we are now seeing it in the British Airports Authority. Conservative hon. Members criticise the nationalised industries and public corporations for not making a profit. They squeeze them until they cut costs, improve efficiency and—at least in one sector—make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
Then the Conservatives say that now that they have made a profit, those clever nationalised industries and public servants have made the operations attractive for the Government's friends to buy them, take over their running and make money. That is an appalling way to run a country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman recognise that whatever points of view have been advocated by Conservative Members, we have always made it clear, certainly with regard to the two organisations that we are discussing, how much we approve, support and applaud the standards to which they operate and the style in which they operate? There is no criticism of the way in which the British Airports Authority and British Airways are run at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, it is amazing how the Conservatives applaud the British Airports Authority for doing a marvellous job and, having done that, they propose to chop it up into little pieces, package it and hand it over to an entrepreneur so that he may make a quick buck out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ridiculous to talk about competition in this way. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood talks about competition between Glasgow and Prest-wick, having made some positive comments about Prestwick. That could be the death of Prestwick. I ask the Under-Secretary to repudiate what the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said. If he does not, I shall have a word with the Secretary of State for Scotland and say that his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is in effect agreeing to the death knell of Prestwick airport sounded by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that Prestwick has certain advantages over Abbotsinch? For a start, it has a 10,000 ft. runway, a better weather factor and fewer inhibitions on noise because there is a much smaller population around Prestwick. Therefore, particularly for transatlantic and heavy cargo traffic that might cause a disturbance to local inhabitants, Prestwick has advantages, including the rail link to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has summarised well the advantages of Prestwick airport. I suggest that he is saying that, instead, he intends to sound the death knell of Abbotsinch because it does not have adequate facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is fierce competition with the currently limited potential for traffic in the lowlands of Scotland, unless a positive directive is given by the Government that Prestwick is the transatlantic gateway, that airport will suffer. I congratulate the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) and his predecessor, who is now Secretary of State for Employment, for taking that initiative, but that is the initiative that is necessary given the current pressure on the airlines to use the south-east of England, which causes danger to the airports in Scotland and to all the provincial airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
It is all right to talk about competition between Glasgow and Prestwick, because they are not far apart, but with which airport does Aberdeen compete? It is nonsense to say that it competes with another airport. No cne travelling to Aberdeen says that he prefers the lunches on the flight to Edinburgh, so he intends to fly to Edinburgh and take a train or bus to Aberdeen. Stornaway is another example. Would anyone fly to Orkney airport because he preferred it, and then swim down to Stornoway? It is utter nonsense to suggest competition there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what some hon. Members said on Second Reading, that it does not militate in favour of a planned development of all British airports that some are currently run by the Civil Aviation Authority, some by the British Airports Authority and some by individual local authorities or other bodies. I favour a greater integration of our airports. I do not approve of selling them off or packaging them and then selling them off. We need a co-ordinated plan for aviation for the whole of the United Kingdom. We could then see a move away from the concentration in the South-East. I have the authority of my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Morley to say that we will in no way support the amendment of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the only surviving member on the Conservative side of the Committee of the Standing Committee which saw through the 1980 Civil Aviation Act, perhaps I may extend to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Trade my somewhat belated congratulations on his elevation to that position and, at the same time, extend to the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer), who was a fellow member of that Standing Committee, my congratulations on his elevation to his present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not allow this moment to pass without paying tribute to the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), who, as a previous Minister and from the Opposition Bench, has become so identified with aviation matters over the last eight years and has shown such an expertise in them that even those of us who have not always agreed with him have nevertheless admired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for my surprise at being on this Standing Committee is that, as some hon. Members will recall, during the Committee stage of last Session's Civil Aviation Bill, there were odd occasions when I found myself in marginal disagreement with the then Minister. I am here today either because my right hon. Friend stood up to me so well that he has now been elevated to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment or, as I prefer to believe, the Government appreciate in retrospect that some of my arguments have been borne out by events. Whichever is the appropriate explanation, I am pleased to turn my attention on this occasion to a matter which did not take up much of the time of the last Standing Committee. That matter is the British Airports Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
It is proper to remind ourselves that the British Airports Authority's cash income comes from just two sources. It comes from airline operations and from sales through concessionaires of duty-free and tax-free goods, catering, car parking, and rents from property. Airline operations is another way of referring to landing charges and the like. Most of what I shall say this morning will relate to the level of landing charges. I am quite aware, as indeed was the hon. Member for Batley and Morley, that there are some inhibitions on what we may say because of the sub judice rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
—"The British Airports Authority will tell us with accuracy that it is embarking in the 1980s on a massive capital development programme costing, prospectively, in excess of £800 million over the next five years. It will, in perfect fairness, remind us that that large amount of money will have to be found partly from loans but mainly from its own revenue. My principal point is whether the amount which comes from loans or, more accurately, is allowed to come from borrowing, is sufficient. I am not speaking against the clause nor am I speaking particularly in favour of the amendment. On the contrary, I am suggesting that there may even be a case for a higher borrowing requirement by the British Airports Authority, if the other side of that argument is to be taken as one which indicates the desirability of lower airport charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Airports Authority will also tell us with some pride that it operates entirely without subsidy from public funds. What it would have to concede in fairness however, is that it has the freedom to fix charges and prices which may well be the envy of other nationalised industries. Therefore, while I am not in any way attacking its basic proposition in this regard, that proposition has to be qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One finds that during 1980-81, airport charges were increased by the quite incredible amount of 35 per cent, overall. In May 1981, they were increased by a further 12 per cent, and, as the hon. Member for Batley and Morley anticipated, there is an application for a further increase of 12 per cent, with effect from 1 March 1982. By any reckoning, that is a gigantic increase in landing charges. Although I cannot say too much about the really large increases because that is the matter which is sub judice, I can tell the Committee that as a result of continuing pressure on airline finances which has flown directly from this policy, there are those who would argue that recent discussions in the United States under what is called the Bermuda II agreement have been less successful than they might have been largely because of the objections raised by the American airlines against the British Airports Authority's charging policy. That must be taken into account in any consideration of whether we are right to concentrate on raising finance through charges or whether there is a case for increased borrowing or other means of raising the finance to which I shall turn my attention later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been rightly said that comparison between one international airport and another is difficult because there are offsetting factors. However, by using
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
the British Airports Authority's figures and examining admittedly the summer peak period—it could be argued by the British Airports Authority's defenders that that is an unfair period to examine—we discover that the charges for a Boeing 747, weighing 335 tonnes and carrying 300 passengers landing at Heathrow during the summer peak period, are £4,586. In comparison, the same aircraft of the same weight with the same number of passengers landing at Amsterdam is charged £1,758, and at Frankfurt the charge is £1,985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is felt that that is taking unfair advantage because one is exemplifying a large aircraft that is full, perhaps we should take as another example a Trident aircraft of 69 tonnes with 100 passengers on board. During the summer peak period, the cost at Heathrow would be £1,119. The charge at Amsterdam would be £445, and £535 at Frankfurt. Therefore, I think it is fair to ask how the other airports manage to charge less. How do they manage to keep their landing charges at such a much lower level and yet sustain the facilities that any of us who have ever visited Amsterdam and Frankfurt must concede are available to passengers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several major European airports have a substantial equity content that comes mainly from the State or local government. Money for capital projects is usually borrowed on the market. Part of my reason for contributing to the debate is to suggest that at least some further consideration might be given to a change in the British approach, to the extent that money for capital projects might be more easily or more readily borrowed on the market in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At United States airports—where the figures for landing charges are substantially lower—the method employed is different. United States airports can raise money through tax-free bonds very often guaranteed by the airlines themselves and at very favourable interest rates. A great deal of the capital investment in airports and, indeed, air traffic control has been met by a Federal tax on the sale of air tickets. Although that is clearly not possible within the ambit of the Bill, I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Trade to explore yet again alternative ways of developing our airports, without the imposition upon our airlines that the present system requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Airports Authority is not impressing its principal customers, the airlines, because of the level of charges imposed upon them. But whereas the authority might then reasonably expect that a grateful travelling public would warm to it, that is not the case, because it is then accused of being able so to fix its charges that it cannot help but make a profit. I have some sympathy with the authority and I want to place on record my agreement that, by and large, under Mr. Norman Payne, it is a very well managed organisation, and nothing I say this morning should detract from that. But if we in a Standing Committee such as this cannot raise our sights a little to see whether we have the best system or whether there might not be a better one, I do not know what other parliamentary opportunity is open to us.

What is important from the Government's point of view, and what a Government supporter feels that he must say to the Minister is that the increase in landing charges is being imposed at a time when there is a powerful Government influence for the reduction of air fares. Some would contend that we cannot square the circle. But if we deliberately increase the amount that the airlines have to charge, we canot expect the massive fall in air fares to which I sometimes think Government Ministers continue to look forward. We cannot have our cake and eat it. While there are massive opportunities for reductions in air fares, particularly in Europe and at off-peak periods—I do not seek to deny that—the general reduction in air fares to which the Government look forward is made infinitely more difficult by the operation of a Government policy on airport charges, as implemented through the British Airports Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's requirement that we should proceed on this basis flows from matters related to the public sector borrowing requirement. We should ask my hon. Friend—although he may not be the most appropriate Minister to ask—if and when the Government reach the stage when they choose to loosen the definition of what constitutes the PSBR, whether there is not a case for saying that, at least in part, the British Airports Authority's finance should be allowed to escape the straitjacket that some of us might contend constitutes the PSBR at present. I believe that the British Airports Authority is not opposed to a different method of raising necessary finance. I ask my hon. Friend to consider afresh the alternatives that I have suggested. That would leave greater scope for the lower fares policy to which I know the Government to be dedicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that any great profit accrues to the British Airports Authority as a result of the security levy. The Government decide on an annual basis the level at which the levy should be set. After a substantial increase a few years ago, it has either been retained at its level or marginally reduced. Is there a genuine and continuing need for the security requirements of the airlines and airports automatically to be met by the British Airports Authority? Is there not a case for returning the security operations either to the airlines themselves or to private enterprise in a wider sense? I have the feeling that the security that we all rightly expect to enjoy at British airports could be provided as efficiently and less expensively were private enterprise once again given the opportunity to do so.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with reference to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson). I have already paid tribute to the British Airports Authority management. Although some would argue that the authority's profitability is virtually inevitable because it is a monopoly, there is an efficiency about its management which I do not underrate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I must agree with my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Friend that there is an opportunity for some form of denationalisation of the British Airports Authority either by selling it off as an entity perhaps with the Government retaining, say, 51 per cent, in the initial stages or, if that is not thought practical, by creating what one might call "Heathrow Limited" and/or "Gatwick Limited" and setting up a competitive system in the airport structure, particularly among the airports in the London area. I endorse my hon. Friend's approach on that but I do not think that we can even begin to consider it until we have sorted out the basis on which the authority is permitted to finance itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said sufficient about the different ways used by European and American airports for my hon. Friend the Minister perhaps to think again whether there could not be a better system. Secondly, I hope that I have persuaded him to talk to his colleagues in the Treasury about whether the public sector borrowing requirement could not be sufficiently loosened to eliminate some of the controls that are applied to the British Airports Authority's financing. I stand this morning not to oppose clause 1 or to support the amendment, but simply to put forward those arguments which, if accepted by the Committee, could arguably lead to a higher borrowing requirement rather than the lower one promoted by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Larobie	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Central Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before speaking to the amendments, I draw your attention, Mr. Mitchell, to an important point concerning Scottish hon. Members and hope that you will take it up through the usual channels. At present, along the Corridor, the Scottish Grand Committee is meeting to discuss a very important topic to hon. Members with Scottish constituencies. We cannot be in Room 14 and participate in the discussions on this Bill today. I draw your attention to this matter, Mr. Mitchell, so that, as Chairman, you can take it up with the appropriate authorities so that the business can be better arranged and Scottish Members are not put in this difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise this matter because when Scottish Sunday newspapers have nothing to write about or no news to report, they always go into the Grand Committee and count all the hon. Members who are not there or are not paarticipating. They run an attendance league table of Scottish Members and never mention those who are serving on other Committees. This concerns not only Opposition Members but the Under-Secretary, and his job of justifying the Government in Scotland is difficult enough without having to' defend himself against these unfair statements.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
the annual report of the British Airports Authority. On page 5 the paragraph dealing with Scottish airports states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The three lowland airports of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Prestwick have been developed over the years to provide facilities to meet traffic needs on the basis of the present distribution of services."</p></blockquote>
This important priority is set out by the British Airports Authority in its annual report. I should like the Minister to explain whether the present proposal to increase the borrowing limits takes account of the changes that have taken place since the publication of that report and since that priority was stated by the Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, do these increased borrowing requirements take into account the fact that British Airways have decided to withdraw all their North Atlantic services from Prestwick? That decision would vitally affect the present distribution of services, because at present Prestwick is the international gateway from and to Scotland. If we can get other airlines interested in taking over these services—various offers have been put forward by Laker, North-West Orient and so on—that would take up the slack that will develop at Prestwick if BA withdraw. But I should like an assurance from the Minister about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has also been another major change recently in the distribution of Scottish services brought about by the application of the tourist company Jetsave to fly from Edinburgh airport to Toronto in Canada and thereby to take up some of the routes used previously by British Airways. That will again change the distribution of services throughout Scotland, and it will take the emphasis away from Prestwick as the international gateway and increase the importance of Edinburgh airport, followed, if Edinburgh succeeds, by Glasgow airport. It seems strange to me that not only is Jetsave putting forward this applicaton but that it will use British Airtours to service that application. As British Airtours is a subsidiary of British Airways, I am wondering what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways have withdrawn their services from Prestwick to North America, yet British Airtours, a subsidiary of British Airways, is being used by Jetsave to commence flights from Edinburgh airport to Toronto. British Airways also seem to be withdrawing from their activities in Scotland using Prestwick and building up other activities in Edinburgh, and perhaps in Glasgow at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am too suspicious about British Airways' activities in this matter, but I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that in 1978 there was a major conference in Glasgow on the future of the Scottish lowland airports. At that conference, the spokesman for British Airways stated clearly that it was British Airways' policy to withdraw from Prestwick airport, if they were allowed to do so, and to centre all their activities on Glasgow or Edinburgh. That was in 1978. Luckily, at that time we had a Labour Government, and the Labour Government refused to allow British Airways to withdraw their activities from Prestwick, stating clearly that Prestwick was the international terminal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
for Scotland and that Prestwick airport had to be used by British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness to the present Government, I must also state that the previous Secretary of State for Trade and the present Secretary of State for Scotland have reinforced the assurances given by the previous Labour Government. But are we now seeing a change? With the appointment of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) as Under-Secretary of State for Trade, are we seeing a change in Government policy? Will the hon. Gentleman interfere with the distribution of services to and from Scottish airports? Will he accept the arguments put forward in 1978 for the withdrawal of British Airways from Prestwick and allow them to develop their activities in Edinburgh, followed by Glasgow? I raise that matter now because, in its annual report, the British Airports Authority states clearly that its financial estimates are based on the present distribution of services to and from Scottish airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), I am not happy about increasing the borrowing requirement of the British Airports Authority. My hon. Friend said that we had tabled the amendment on the basis that we could not table another amendment to increase the borrowing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should look at the position of the British Airports Authority. It is easy to make a profit— some Conservative Members have made this point— if charges can be increased to overcome costs and add a small percentage. The policy of the present Government is forcing the Authority to increase its charges in order to meet the Government's financial target without forcing it to examine its present activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that the British Airport Authority is to increase its charges next year by the inflation rate of 12 per cent., but, at a recent meeting with the top people in British Airways, we were told that that 12 per cent, would be an average. Let us take Heathrow airport as an example. The increased charges to British Airways for using that airport will be 17 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is easy to' make a profit if, when the Government suggest a wages increase of 4 per cent., the Authority says that it will increase charges by an average of 12 per cent, and to certain airlines, such as the nationalised airline, British Airways, it will increase charges by 17 per cent. As well as looking at the British Airports Authority we must look at airlines using United Kingdom airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always suported the theory that the basic requirements for a public service should be provided as cheaply as possible. In many cases, the service should be provided at nil cost. That is why I believe that, when we make motorways, they should be a direct charge on the taxpayer and not on the people using them. That is why I am against tolls such as exist in other European countries. That is why I believe in a free water service. The supply of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
water is a basic requirement, and that basic requirement should be provided to everyone at a charge to the ratepayer or the taxpayer and not as a charge to the people using it. Those are basic services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Airports should be an extension of the road system. We are now arguing in Scotland that road ways should be extended to include the piers on the West coast of Scotland. We are arguing that case even though present Ministers have accepted that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has a case to argue. I wish, however, that he would not argue it in this Committee, because the Bill has nothing to do with piers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It adds support to the philosophy. I am trying to show that British airports should be accepted as a basic facility for the airlines which, in my opinion, would be a better method of financing the British Airports Authority than the method used by this and previous Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the Public Accounts Committee's Twentieth report. Paragraph 8 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As BAA is a monopoly operator Parliament and the users of the Authority's services should be given as much information as possible on which to judge its performance ".</p></blockquote>
It is certainly the case that more information is now made available by the British Airports Authority. The paragraph goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We also consider that BAA's performance should be monitored in relation to performance at overseas airports ".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar compared European and United States airports with British airports. A legitimate criticism is made that Opposition Members have to take up. Have the Government received any information from the British Airports Authority following the criticism in the Public Accounts Committee report about the comparison with overseas airports? If that information can be provided today, it might not be necessary to increase the limits by the amount provided in the Bill. The Government might be prepared to accept the Opposition's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final part of paragraph 8 of the PAC report, recommends that the Government and the British Airports Authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"should consider further efforts to secure further information which will enable valid comparisons to be made ".</p></blockquote>
The Public Accounts Committee is therefore demanding that legitimate comparisons, not the comparisons provided fcr the Committee by the authority, should be made and presented to hon. Members, Can these legitimate comparisons be provided today to enable hon. Members to reach a reasonable decision on the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Martin	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Springburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a personal interest in seeing that there is a healthy civil aviation industry. I worked for six years with the Rolls-Royce aero-engine division in Glasgow. I was involved in the manufacture of the RB-211 engine. Many thousands of people not only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
in Glasgow but throughout the country are employed in aero-engine manufacture. Their jobs depend very much on a healthy aircraft industry. I hope therefore that air traffic increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of profitability. The only way for airports to make a profit is for them to give their customers—the public and the airlines—a good service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are not many complaints that I can make about the British Airports Authority. I travel every week between Glasgow and Heathrow airports. There are, however, a few areas about which I feel concern. There is no rail link between Glasgow and Glasgow airport. Nor is there a rail link between Glasgow airport and Prestwick airport. People using transatlantic flights wish sometimes to get from Prestwick to Glasgow airport. I have also met several travellers who have flown from London to spend a few days in Glasgow and then wished to go on to Prestiwick. There should be talks with the British Airports Authority and British Rail to see that these links are provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector does well at British airports. I am not served by a British Airports Authority employee when I go to the newsagents' stall. I am served by an employee of a private franchise company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe I am also right in saying that the refreshment facilities at Glasgow are run by a private company. I have no complaints about that situation. There is, however, one private company that I do complain about. I refer to National Car Parks. That company has the franchise for car parking facilities at all the authority's airports. According to the 1980-81 accounts, the income received from car parking fees—I presume that this is the income from car parks—by the British Airports Authority was £196,000 at Glasgow. That represents a little more than £500 a day. The price at the moment for parking for 24 hours at Glasgow is £1-80. Several thousand cars were parked in the car park every day. If the British Airports Authority is only getting £500 a day for the franchise from National Car Parks, National Car Parks at Glasgow airport must be operating the rip-off of the century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentions Heathrow. National Car Parks must be doing well there. It is appropriate, therefore, for the Minister to ask the British Airports Authority to look into its arrangements with National Car Parks. It is a scandal that a motorist has to pay £1-80 a day for 24 hours in an open car park. Few motorists, if using air travel, would want the facility for less than 24 hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says £1-80. Is he not aware that at London Airport it costs more than £2 for 24 hours? If a car is parked in the short-stay car park, the cost is about £8-40 for 24 hours. It may even be more. Is that not even more of a scandal than the situation described by the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. These charges should be examined. If National Car Parks is giving a service, it should manage to get some profit. If, however, it is getting these rates, it is doing very well and the matter is worth investigating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a monopoly service, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If there is any talk—it is only talk in this Committee—of selling off to private enterprise, it should be remembered that Glasgow was a municipal airport and that for a nominal sum the airport was handed over to the British Airports Authority. An assurance was given that the authority would look after Glasgow airport. It has made a good job of it. A great deal of the proceeds of any sell-off should go back to the city of Glasgow, which founded that airport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like some of his hon. Friends, the hon. Gentleman talks about privatisation in terms of selling back to private enterprise. What is his view of the further suggestion, which is part and parcel of this discussion, that employees of the airports concerned should have the option to buy some equity in such an airport. To that extent, they would have a greater involvement and share in what was going on, as happened with British Aerospace and the National Freight Corporation. What objection do Opposition Members have to that suggestion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a trade unionist, I see no reason why workers should not be allowed to invest in the companies for which they work. It is surely a vote of confidence by the work force if employees invest in their company. However, manual workers, even if they had that facility, might not be able to invest much money in it because of the wages that they got. I agree that there is no harm in employees being allowed to invest in the organisations for which they work.

I do not believe that anyone can complain about the rail links from Heathrow to the centre of London, because they are excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Steen) says that he has complaints. During the past two and a half years that I have been a Member of the House, I have seldom been delayed on the rail link between Heathrow and the centre of London. What I complain about is the baggage arrangements. Anyone who travels on the shuttle is extremely unwise to allow his baggage to be put in the baggage compartment. The benefit of the hour's journey between Glasgow and Heathrow can be lost because it frequently takes half an hour or three-quarters of an hour to get one's baggage. It is a scandal, and something should be done about it. If we seek to encourage tourism, we must do something about tourists' first impression on arriving in this country. That kind of delay could destroy the tourist industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The self-service cafeteria facilities at Heathrow
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
should also be investigated. They are swill-bins. It is a scandal that such facilities are available. I am not exaggerating when I say that I went to that cafeteria for a snack just before taking a flight, and I had to about turn and walk out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want airport authorities to make money, we must consider how many customers take one look at that cafeteria and decide not to go in. The problems involve not having enough people to take away trays and clear tables. That is why the cafeteria is such an unsightly mess. If environmental health officers go there, they must have their eyes firmly closed. That is surely the only way that the cafeteria has not had a closure order made on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make two comments? The journey from Westminster to London airport by Underground takes far too long. If one takes a short domestic flight of about an hour, it takes that long to get out to Heathrow. By car, one can do it in about half the time. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that something should be done to speed up that service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that if he came to Liverpool airport he would find a first-rate restaurant, a clean cafeteria and an excellent bar. When he reached the excellent terminal building, he would find that his baggage had arrived before him, so fast is the baggage turnround. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would come to Liverpool and see how we do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be only too happy to go to Liverpool, if the hon. Gentleman happened to be standing at the bar that he described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said before, I have no complaints about Glasgow and the hon. Gentleman has no complaints about Liverpool. So there must be something very wrong with the management of Heathrow airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the journey could not be faster, but I do not accept that the journey by car is much quicker than by tube. I have done the journey by cab in an effort to get here for a Three-line Whip, and it has been absolute murder. It depends entirely on the time of the day. All I can say is that it takes me from my home in the north of Glasgow, travelling across the city, exactly three hours to get to Westminster. That is no bad going, as long as one times the shuttle properly, and as long as one does not put a suitcase in the baggage compartment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perhaps under a misapprehension. It is my understanding that it is the responsibility of the airline, not of the British Airports Authority, to handle baggage from the aeroplane to the carousel. To that extent the hon. Gentleman may be under a misunderstanding. He should direct his criticism at the airline, not at the British Airports Authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely any service that is given in an airport, whether or not it is the direct responsibility of the airport authority, is a reflection on that airport. Therefore the management there has a duty

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
to see that the service is carried out. Whether the staff belong to the airline or to the British Airports Authority is irrelevant. There are serious delays, and the British Airports Authority is getting a great deal of criticism for them. The matter should be investigated, because it reflects badly on our civil aviation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Bright	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the opportunity pass without associating myself with some of my hon. Friends' comments about the British Airports Authority. I regard it as a mechanism for extracting from current travellers a surplus to pay for future airport development. In my view, that is the basic principle that keeps the operation in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, have an interest in an airport, in that I represent Luton, and I represent the part of Luton which houses Luton airport. That airport is not run by the British Airports Authority. In my opinion, it is much more efficient, and its charges are much lower than those of the British Airports Authority. That is the reason for its existence and the reason why it attracts enough customers, both airlines and passengers, and makes a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Luton airport is run by the corporation. That enables those who live around the airport to have a share in the profits generated by it. My hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) said that it might not be a bad idea to allow those who worked in airports to have a stake in them. It is also a good idea to consider allowing those who live around airports to have a stake in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why we cannot consider the privatisation of the British Airports Authority. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Mem ber for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) that we should not consider privatising it en bloc, be cause, for example, we need to have Heathrow and Gatwick operating separately. A problem with the British Airports Authority, in always trying to de velop itself and further its own interests, is that its enormous monopoly in the South-East has led to waste in resources elsewhere. The South-East air ports are overburdened with passengers while other airports such as Manchester, Birmingham, East Mid lands, Newcastle, to say nothing of Luton, are under-utilised—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Liverpool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —and Liverpool, of course, which is a privately-run operation. It is not even run by the corporation. We must look closely at our resources from a national point of view. For that reason, the structure of the British Airports Authority should be considered in terms of whether it should dominate, as it does, the airports in the South-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who says that he favours the consideration of privatisation and also the splitting up of the two major London airports, Gatwick and Heathrow, and operating them entirely separately within the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
We must also consider the way in which airports are financed in other parts of the world, especially in America where public running has been brought into the airports through the issuing of bonds and straight private capital being invested in them. There is no reason why we should not do the same here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also no reason why we should not encourage investment in our airports by allowing some of the airlines to operate their own terminals and facilities within the airports, as they do in America and other major air terminals abroad. That in itself would diminish the British Airports Authority's requirement constantly to borrow more money. The operators should have a stake in their own facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I was, like the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) surprised to find myself a member of the Committee. I have searched for a reason, and I have found it. When the Secretary of State moved the Second Reading he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is not a legislative earthquake".</p></blockquote>
I have read the Bill and he can say that again. The Secretary of State went on to say that it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a straightforward Bill with only five clauses which should not be the subject of major controversy." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 November 1979; vol. 13, c. 41.] </p></blockquote>
If I can paraphrase that, it means that this piece of legislation is safe and respectable. Therefore, the usual channels, looking for someone to be dumped on to the Committee, immediately thought of me. What is more, I have no airport axe to grind. I can consider the legislation as does the man in the street, because that is what I am in civil aviation matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make one or two comments that should show that I am not a safe man to put on any Committee. Clause 1 seeks in principle to extend the external borrowing limits for a State monopoly. Since I have been a Member of the House, I have had the most profound suspicion of monopolies. That is not because I believe that monopoly is inherently bad. But no monopoly should have its privileges accepted without question. They should be earned and then examined and scrutinised at every opportunity. If public money is invested in any sort of monopoly and if there is no competitor against which to measure its performance, it is up to all of us to ensure that public money is well spent, whether it is internally generated or whether it comes from an external borrowing facility.

I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer), who is leading for the Opposition, and the Under-Secretary of State. I shall look forward to his reply to the debate.

Our amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Leave out ' £200 million ' and insert ' £150 million '."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we propose lowering the external borrowing facility because for technical reasons we cannot raise it. I felt that it was odd for Opposition hen. Members to be arguing about reducing the limit by £50 million. However, every proposition

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
has its difficulties, and ours is no exception. I shall proceed to support the amendment as best I Can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My major point is that the British Airports Authority requires a considerable amount of new investment. I do not believe that that is in dispute, because it owns and operates seven major airports— Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Prestwick, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. I have experienced only a fraction of those as a consumer, but I am advised that those airports handle 70 per cent, of the passenger and almost 90 per cent, of the cargo air traffic in the United Kingdom. That is a substantial investment responsibility for any enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sum up by saying that the British Airports Authority, in terms of its investment policy and framework, has much to do. It also has much thinking to do about the best way in which it can spend the public money invested in it. All of us must scrutinise rigorously every pound we put into the organisation, because, at a time when resources are in short supply, we must get the best value for money for every penny piece that we put into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Airports Authority has much to do. To put it in a nutshell, the British economy is currently substantially depressed. We must frame an investment policy so that, when the economy revives, we shall be in a position to take advantage of it. Now is the time to think carefully about investment decisions, because we are considering one of the lifelines of the British economy. The British Airways Authority provides considerable internal lines of communication and, for a major trading nation, the standards and efficiency of airport services are Of major importance. Therefore, we should concentrate on how we can use the investment for increasing the efficiency of the operation and cutting its costs so that we can cut costs across the board relating to our economic performance.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the British Airports Authority is embarking on a major investment programme over the next six or seven years. That is expected, on outturn prices, to cost more than £700 million. I have also been told that the British Airports Authority had at the outset a capital debt of £53 million and that over the past 15 years it has been consistently profitable. If that is right, that much can be said for it because, when a surplus over costs is generated and that is called profit, it is at least one index of the efficiency with which the assets of the enterprise are being used. However, we must discern whether the surplus arises because of the way the assets are used or from the Way that it is priced in a monopoly situation where there is frequently no alternative. I am not making a judgement either Way on that. I simply say that the Committee arid the House have a responsibility, if managing public money, to consider precisely how the surplus is being generated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statistic which is relevant to the debate is that over the past 15 years of the operation, for a total capital expenditure of £400 million, loans have totalled only £14 million. In other words, the enterprise has generated much of the money for capital
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
investment from its own internal resources. If one considers finance in a Gladstonian way, that is probably a commendable performance. A Gladstonian system of balancing the budget—which is now prevalent in Treasury circles—works according to the principle that like a housewife, there should be a surplus, and any purchase required should be made out of the prudent way the money is managed. It is as if the Treasury had never heard of Keynesian economics. We are engaged in examining whether, over the past 15 years, that has been the right way to carry on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should capital expenditure be financed purely out of money internally generated? No, that should not be done in all cases because, if any surplus is generated above costs, concentration should be given to putting the money back into the business. For major items of Capital expenditure, one should go to the market and borrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering one of the most debated principles in the House, because we can distinguish between current and capital expenditure. It is right that we should pay our way on current expenses out of what we generate. However, it is also right when major capital items of expenditure are engaged in, that we should have access to the open market and borrow. That strikes me as being an accepted and orthodox commercial principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know Stansted airport quite well and that it is still almost a green field site. If the outcome of the Stansted airport inquiry is that the airport should go ahead, have the figures for the extension of the borrowing requirement taken fully into consideration the investment that will have to be made in the airport? We know that the major runway has already been laid and that it did not cost much. However, the development of the airport and all the supporting facilities necessary will cost a great deal of money. I wonder how that is related to the figures in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always suspect powers that are given to a Secretary of State, and they need to be watched carefully. The Secretary of State may, by order, increase the limit to £300 million. In other words, when he thinks that the time is opportune—I hope that he will take advice about that—he will up the ante by about £100 million. I suggest that before any Secretary of State is allowed to do that, he should have to tell us exactly what he intends to do with the £100 million and why it is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Secretary of State Will exercise quite close control. I shall believe that When I see it. It is said that it will be done without any increase in public expenditure and that the British Airports Authority Will continue to require strict consent for particular borrowings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman quote the speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that the new borrowing limits had nothing to do with the external financing limits. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They do not mean, therefore, that, as a result of the increase in borrowing limits, there will be any increase in public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
I take that statement at its face value. If I am wrong, I stand to be corrected, and perhaps the Under-Secretary will answer the point raised by his hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood. However, it is the major task of the House to ensure that the Secretary of State is watched carefully when he spends the extra money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should issue a warning on the privatisation issue. The Secretary of State said that this was not a Bill about privatisation and continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot recollect that the Conservative Party manifesto gave any indication of a proposal to denationalise the British Airports Authority."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the Conservative manifesto has the same force as one of the tablets of stone. However, the Secretary of State continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some of the good gifts must be put on the stall now and some must be left until a little later." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 November 1981; Vol. 13, c. 42-45.] </p></blockquote>
I leave it to the Committee to work out the meaning of that, but it is probably a warning for us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Iain Sproat)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer) on his elevation to the Opposition Front Bench. I do that with particular heartfelt warmth as I find myself in the same somewhat uneasy situation in the Committee. I congratulate him on his astounding grasp of the subject after only a few days in office. My astonishment was only somewhat diminished by learning that he served in previous Civil Aviation Bill Committees, which I have not had the honour or pleasure of doing. None the less, I congratulate him on his intricate knowledge and the reasonable and moderate way he moved the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a general response to what has been raised in the debate and then try to deal with the individual points which hon. Members raised. On the general aspects which arise out of the amendments, the financial limits proposed on the Bill are intended to provide adequate scope for the borrowings which we expect British Airports Authority to need for its present investment plans over at least the next five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). The Secretary of State for Trade was precisely right when he said that the extension of the borrowing limit did not have any necessary and obvious effect on the external financing limit for any one year. The EFL must be considered and scrutinised every year, and, within that EFL, every major borrowing must get specific permission from the Secretary of State. In addition to all that, if the Secretary of State wants to increase the borrowing limit by ah extra slice—£100 million in this case—he must return to the House to get permission arid, therefore, he must go into the sort of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
detail which the hon. Member for Ipswich suggested, in his Gladstonian way, that he ought to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plans which the present borrowing limit refers to are consistent with the Government's airport policy and the strategy for airport expansion to meet expected growth and demand in the south-east of England which was set out in the 1978 White Paper on Airport Policy. That White Paper was issued by the previous Labour Government, and I recommend many aspects of it, although not all, to the Opposition. They may find some forthright remarks about the need for users to pay for what they use. They will go slightly against the grain of the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary must remember, as he grows more experienced in his job, that although Under-Secretaries and Secretaries of State are changed in various Governments, we can never change the officials and we get the same reports and information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has been watching too many television programmes for his own good. However, he does have a little point there. Nevertheless, if he is saying that his right hon. and hon. Friends accept advice from officials which they should not, he must take that up with his own hon. Friends. The Government would never dream of accepting advice which they did not agree with 100 per cent. However, I must not allow myself to be diverted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend and I made clear on Second Reading, these plans include work on the fourth terminal at Heathrow, which is underway—this is in specific answer to points raised about what the money was to be used for—and, secondly, a continuing programme to improve and modernise existing airport facilities. I am sure that that will please the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin), who spoke about the need to improve facilities. Many hon. Members will agree that certain facilities are needed at airports. Thirdly, the increased funding will be necessary for a second terminal at Gatwick if the relevant consents are given and if the outcome of the current inquiry is consonant with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted with interest that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), who I expected to see sitting opposite me, went into how the funds should be raised when he was in the United States. He said that the British Airways Authority should be allowed to finance more of its capital expenditure by borrowing. That is precisely what the Government accept. We believe that where an industry's investment programme is uneven and contains exceptionally large expenditure, as is necessarily the case with airport developments, it will be necessary for the industry to borrow and supplement resources generated within the business. It is for that reason that the Government seek to increase the authority's financial limit by £125 million to £200 million and, with the consent of the House, would seek to further increase, it 	<div class='sub'>v</div> <!-- sub -->if and when it became necessary.:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
In that regard, let me give to the Committee some precise details of what I mean. At present, the authority's debt is about £62 million, including its commencing capital debt of £52 million. Its external financing limit for this year, as the Committee will know, is £14 million net, and that the authority expects to take up. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced yesterday, we have agreed an EFL of £48 million net for next year. That, together with the authority's temporary borrowings, which may be as high as £15 million, will use up the present statutory limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limit of £150 million proposed in the amendment would therefore leave little scope for any further borrowings in 1983-84. Therefore, in less than two years' time the Secretary of State would be obliged to seek the consent of the House to increase the limit by a further £100 million, which the clause and amendment would allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House is necessarily accustomed to granting substantial borrowing powers to the public sector that allow industries to borrow for the purposes of capital expenditure which can be shown to meet the required rates of return and can be contained in the external financing limits agreed with the industries. To limit the increase to only £25 million, with the certainty that consent to a further £100 million would be necessary after only two years, is not in keeping with practices under successive Governments, both Labour and Conservative. I hope that that will be sufficient as a general background to allow Opposition Members to withdraw their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to one or two specific matters that my hon. Friends and Opposition Members raised about the conduct of the British Airports Authority. The hon. Member for Batley and Morley seemed to criticise the Government for putting a required rate of return on the British Airports Authority. He said that that showed there was no flexibility. He used all the other key words of abuse that we have become accustomed to hearing from the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Labour's White Paper of 1978, it was said that the users must expect to pay for the facilities that they used. That is an eminently sensible principle. The previous Labour Government endorsed it, and the present Conservative Government now endorse it. All that we did in addition to the general principle that was enunciated by the Labour Government was to say that we believed that 6 per cent, real CCA rate of return was fair. So flexible and reasonable were we in all that we do we have said that that can be spread over three years. We have not said that it will be in the first, second or third year. We are spreading it over three years. The 6 per cent. CCA rate of return spread over three yearse is extremely flexible. It is a flexibility in which the private sector often does not have the opportunity to indulge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Batley and Morley made a fair point about the difficulties in which the Committee conducts its proceedings because of the current legislation against the British Airports Auth-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
ority. I must be constrained in what I say, but I shall try to be as frank as possible with the Committee. It would be only fair and proper to comment on the next round of charges and the figure of 12 per cent, mentioned by the hon. Members for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) and Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 12 per cent, figure is only a proposal at this stage by the British Airports Authority. It is currently discussing the figure with the airlines, so there could be a modification either way. That percentage is only the starting base for discussion. Within that 12 per cent, no doubt there will be variations of rate for different airports. That is the straightforward position on the next round of increases currently under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) mentioned 17 per cent, as being the increase proposed for landing fees at Heathrow by the British Airports Authority. Will my hon. Friend confirm whether that was the starting point for the negotiations with the airlines by the British Airports Authority for Heathrow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot. I heard my hon. Friend's indignant interjection from a seated position when the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) said that. I have no doubt that the attention of the British Airports Authority will be drawn to that gasp of horror and that it will take that into account when conducting the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be as frank as I can about user charges. I am sure that many hon. Members here will know this, but others outside the Committee may not realise the intense complexity of user charges. It is not just a question of saying: "Here is what we will charge: It is a flat rate." Different airports have different rates. There are also weight charges, passenger charges, aeroplane parking charges, different rates for helicopters and for aeroplanes under 16 tonnes, over 16 tonnes and over 60 tonnes. There are differences between winter time and summer time, between peak hours and normal hours and even between different days of the week at Gatwick. In addition, there are Government security charges and air traffic control charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely difficult to make fair comparisons. Usually people do not make comparisons not because they are trying to dodge the issue—the last thing that any Minister would want to do is to try to dodge the issue—but because they want to pin it down as hard as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to aeroplane parking charges. Heathrow is the world's busiest international airport and it is also exceptionally small. SchipB&I is far smaller— it is smaller than Terminal 1 in terms of traffic. It has a large expanse of ground, so that the parking problem does not arise at it does at Heathrow. Therefore, to compare charges is to ignore the geographic realities of life. That is one example of the difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conceding that those comparisons are odious, will the Minister confirm that one of the results of either making or not making those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
comparisons is that if London, Heathrow and Gat-wick priced themselves out of the market, aircraft companies would head for Amsterdam or Frankfurt, taking with them tourists who might otherwise benefit the British economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Comparisons are not odious, but merely misleading. I am extremely keen to make fair comparisons. The idea that Schiphol could be London's third airport is dangerous ground because of the current inquiry. I am sure that Mr. Norman Payne would say that it was an insane idea and that he would make certain that there was no question of user charges diverting traffic to Schiphol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is right that a comparison with the United States should be made. But again, for totally different reasons, it is difficult to make any fair comparison between user charges in the United States and user charges made by the British Airports Authority in the United Kingdom. First, there is the whole bond question. If one buys a bond in the United States to help fund an airport there, one can set off the price of that bond against income tax. That is the type of subsidy—it may be right or it may be wrong—that exists in the United States. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that we should examine such matters, but that will not be possible today. Clearly, tax allowances on bonds are a type of subsidy at Which the Treasury, so far is not prepared to look.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, airlines in the United States very often operate their own terminals and their own security systems. There is no question of user charges being charged in exactly the same way because they are already using their own facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third factor that most importantly differentiates user charges in the United States from those in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe is that there is a federal ticket tax in the United States. The hon. Member for Batley and Morley mentioned that tax, out of which can be funded up to 80 per cent, of airport facilities. All these different types of subsidy—tax allowances, ticket tax and the fact that airlines own their own facilities— make extremely difficult a meaningful comparison. Nevertheless, the most cogent points made by hon. Members on both sides of the Commitee on this matter will, I am sure, be most closely regarded by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
Mr. Norman Payne when he is reading the accounts of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the subject of performance criteria, to which the hon. Member for Batley and Morley drew more detailed attention than was possible during Second Reading. I shall clarify and expand On what I said then. The performance aims for the British Airports Authority were introduced in 1980 for the three-year period to 1983. The authority's progress towards these aims is monitored each year during discussions of the authority's investment and financing proposals. In the first year of the period, the Authority has made useful progress towards the reduction of costs and of the number of its employees. But I am sure the Com-mittee will understand that the reduction in passenger traffic which has taken place over the last two years because of world recession has made it extremely difficult for the authority to live up to the standards that it hoped to achieve in the immediate past and which it certainly intends to achieve in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the report of the PAC which was referred to by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He may like to know that in respect of the additional performance aims for which the PAC called, the Department of Trade has commissioned a study to examine the possibility of establishing suitable parameters to compare performances of international airports, given all the difficulties that I have already mentioned. The problems are considerable because of the different methods of financing and the different methods of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken on board the PAC's criticisms. We agree with these in principle, and our examination will be as close as the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) and Mr. Gladstone could possibly want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave the Committee on a cliffhanger. When we return to our deliberations on Tuesday, I shall reveal the Government's attitude to the very important question of the privatisation of the British Airports Authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
