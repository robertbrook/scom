	<p>" 13.—(1) Where—
	<ol>
	<li>in an action under the Fatal Accidents Acts damages are claimed in respect of future pecuniary loss; or</li>
	<li>in an action for damages for personal injuries damages are claimed in respect of future pecuniary loss (including future pecuniary loss consisting of the reasonable value of any services to which section 5(1) of this Act applies, being services that would probably have been rendered after judgment),</li>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause deals with a problem that has troubled the legal profession for many years. The courts normally welcome the evidence of experts and have no difficulty in understanding or handling it. Part of the expertise of judges and lawyers is to understand the expertise of others. However, when the need arises to arrive at a view about the future—for example, in order to assess damages for loss of expectation of life or for the future effects of a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
personal injury—they need to know such matters as the average expectation of life of a person having characteristics of the plaintiff or how long he might have been likely to have remained in work had he not sustained the accident, what his prospects were of remaining in good health, what income tax he might have been likely to pay and all the eventualities that affect individuals in this world of ours. In particular, if they wish adequately to reflect what they wish to reflect, they need to assess future inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters fall within the expertise of actuaries. Of course, it is true that by the standards of older professions that profession is a relatively new arrival, but its members possess a real expertise which is much in use in the age in which we live and is indispensable to such commercial activities as insurance. Yet the courts have been most reluctant to hear actuarial evidence. In the case of Mitchell v. Mul-holland in 1971, it was held
	<br><blockquote><p>"that any element of certainty obtained by use of actuarial evidence, when applied to future contingencies, resulted in such an imprecise mode of assessing damages for future earnings as to present no advantages over the conventional method which was the best primary basis of assessment".</p></blockquote>
More recently, in the case of Auty Mills Rogers v. National Coal Board, reported in 	<i>The Times</i> of 1 July 1981, Mr. Justice Tudor Evans, a judge very experienced in matters of assessing damages, for example, of personal injury, held that he could not admit actuarial evidence of likely future inflation in a claim for the loss in value of a pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the alternative to that method of assessment? The answer is that it is an informed guess. It is usually said to consist of the multiplier and, basically, that involves the judge making an informed guess about the likely length of the working life of the plaintiff and then discounting something for the vicissitudes of life. He will consider the likelihood that the plaintiff will die or be killed in an accident, be incapacitated or contract a disease. That is what actuaries do. That is not adopting an alternative method of assessing damages but retaining the same method and doing it less scientifically and accurately. It is simply rejecting the expertise of actuaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An actuary attempts to predict the likelihood of those things happening in the future. Of cuorse, they do not guarantee accurately to predict what will happen. They look at what has happened in the past in relation to specific factors and consequences and then do what scientists have always done. They assume that unless something happens to the contrary, past trends will continue into the future. Unless there is some reason why the trend should be altered, it is likely to continue. The sun rose yesterday morning, it rose this morning, and the probabilities are that it will rise tomorrow morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Institute of Actuaries is aware of that. I confess that I was not, but I am not an actuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Actuaries avail themselves of human experience and use the past as a guide to the future, but they do it precisely and with expertise. If I may adopt
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
the words of Aneurin Bevan, " Why look in a crystal ball when you can read the book?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the courts' arguments frequently seem to be that because the future is uncertain and because we cannot be 100 per cent, accurate in our predictions, we should abdicate any attempt to predict. Of course, it does not simply rest there. We know that the courts' informed guesses are usually extreme ely moderate. If we cannot be sure, it seems always better to err on the side of moderation. The effect in practice is that damages for personal injuries compare most unfavourably, for the victims, with damages, for example, in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an economic argument for keeping damages low. Damages paid for industrial accidents, for example, are one of the costs of industrial production. One way to keep down production costs is to decide that the damages for industrial accidents should be low. But that should be a conscious decision of the House after proper debate. It should not be done by suppressing the evidence when pretending to be deciding something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pearson Commission, as in so many cases, turned its attention to this problem but decided to leave the matter, because the Law Commission was considering it. But the Pearson Commission ventured in paragraph 655 to make this comment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The majority recognise that no method of lump-sum calculation can achieve mathematical perfection. But they consider that use should be made of such practical assistance as mathematics can provide."</p></blockquote>
The Law Commission considered the question at much greater length and reported in 1973—report No. 56. It recommended the use of actuarial evidence when appropriate. It pointed out that such use is not a novelty suddenly foisted on us in the latter half of the twentieth century. It quoted Lord Blackburn in the case of McDonald v McDonald in 1880. Since I would not presume to paraphrase or improve on Lord Blackburn's language, perhaps I can weary the Committee for a moment by quoting it. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But I think the Legislature knew that the value of an expectancy must, in a great degree at least, depend on the probabilities of the duration of life, the chances of marriage, and the chances of such marriages proving fruitful. They must, I think, have known that actuaries had tables, founded on extensive experience, on which they acted, which enabled them to value with considerable accuracy the probabilities of life: and that though the experience on which the calculations as to the probabilities of marriage and issue were based was much narrower, and the results more subject to uncertainty, yet that some calculation could be made in that way and none could be made in any other. I think therefore that the Legislature must have contemplated that the Court would call in the assistance of an actuary to report to them on all those matters which properly come within the province of an actuary."</p></blockquote>
We are not asking more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission went further. It proceeded to draft a clause which it thought would be appropriate in some future Bill to effect what it had in mind. This is that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Ian Percival)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will not think me discourteous if I do not adopt the argu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
ments against the new clause which he put forward for the purpose of knocking it down. Neither singly nor collectively do they represent my grounds for resisting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early 1970s, a sub-committee of the Law Reform Committee and the Law Commission both said that they thought that more use should be made of actuaries. The Bar was active on the Law Reform Committee's sub-committee. However, time has passed since then and views have changed. The Pearson Commission, as the right hon, and learned Gentleman said, did not endorse the Law Commission's recommendation. It gave a cautious and tentative support to the possibility that further use be made of actuaries. One suggestion was, I believe, that the court might call an actuary who would then assist the court as far as an actuary could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much thought has been given by those who would have to operate the provisions since the Law Commission made its suggestion. The result of that thinking is that, far from leading to accuracy or unanimity, busy practitioners at the Bar feel strongly that such use of an actuary might be misleading, because the actuary has to work on factors which have to be estimated by the judge. The damages will depend, in many cases, on the judge's estimate of the number of years of life that the plaintiff has lost. No one can know that until the judge has decided it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of actuaries in the run up to the trail, therefore, is much lessened where that is one of the factors, because they will have to guess what the judge will say. I have heard it described as giving an impression of accuracy, just as it gives an impression of accuracy to calculate the area of a circle by multiplying the radius by 	<i>IT</i> to four decimal points, but that if there is an error of 25 per cent, in measuring the radius the calculation will not be half as accurate as it appears. Here, one must start by estimating the loss of expectation of life. If that is wrong—how one gets it right I do not know—the supposed accuracy goes for a Burton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case before the court on appeal—about which, therefore, I must not say too much—in which one side called an actuary whose evidence took five days. I doubt whether that added much to the simplification of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practitioners feel that, if it becomes the practice to call an actuary, as soon as it is know that one side is to have an actuary the other side will feel that it must have one, too. That is understandable. Then there will be two lots of experts, both supposedly doing a precise mathematical calculation but based on figures which have, in the first place, to be estimated. The view is strongly held that that would make settlements much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that there is not scope for better use of actuarial tables. They are used so that, once the judge has made his findings on the basic facts—which must be known before the tables are used—the court can in some cases turn to the tables and make good use of them. There is every
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
reason for the practitioners and the actuaries to get together to see in what respects, if any, those tables could be improved so as to be of greater assistance to the parties and to the court in determining difficult questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I am wrong in thinking that this is a probing new clause. I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman believes that, before legislating on the matter, we should need lengthier debates than are possible on the Bill. Therefore, I have limited my remarks, for the moment, to objections in principle and the current views of the legal profession. There is sufficient reason, even based on the little I have said, to say that the matter is unsuitable for the Bill. We shall want to return to the issue later, and I should like to see members of the legal profession in close consultation with the actuaries, to see how much the tables can be improved. Despite that, I suggest that the matter is not suitable for inclusion in the Bill, and I invite the right hon. and learned Gentleman to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Solicitor-General that we have been debating today basically two categories of new clause—those which have been called preliminary canters round the course, and those which we might call gallops round well-worn trenches. I accept at once that this measure is in the former category. I am grateful for the invitation of the Solicitor-General, and I accept that there should be further discussion before I attempt to' persuade the Committee that the clause should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel bound to say that I was not wholly persuaded by what I understood to be the difficulty expressed by the Solicitor-General. Of course, an actuary cannot proceed until he knows the assumptions on which he is required to proceed. But there are two answers to that objection. First, having made the presumptions, we proceed unscientifically. Even having measured the radius accurately, we multiply it by two and a half times π and so we do not get the area correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second answer is that it is part of the expertise of an actuary to assist us with our assumptions. When a judge takes a figure for loss of expectation of life, he does not pluck it out of air. He wants some assistance from past exprience, and that is where actuaries can help him. But I accept that the precise use which can be most profitably made of actuarial evidence must depend upon discussions between the Institute of Actuaries and representatives of the profession. I gathered from what the Solicitor-General said that the profession would be happy to meet the institute for such discussions. With that preliminary canter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'2A. The Lord Chancellor may by order made by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament specify districts which shall for the purpose of subsection (2) above and sections 55 and 59 of this Act be deemed to be metropolitan districts.'.".—	<i>[Mr. Archer.]</i></p></blockquote></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another new clause about magistrates' courts committees. For the benefit of any member of the Committee who was not present this morning, I ought perhaps to explain briefly that a magistrates' courts committee is a committee of magistrates which decides what is required by way of court accommodation, office facilities, staff, training, training for justices, and which generally services the courts in a particular location. The Committee will recollect that that was the subject of new clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The magistrates who serve on those committees are elected by their own benches. Before 1974, each city and county borough had its own magistrates' courts committee. County benches had a separate committee, usually consisting of representatives of the rural courts in the county. East magistrates' courts committee dealt with one local authority. It emerged from discussions this morning that there are already sufficient problems in the relationship between the magistrates' courts committee—whose function it is to call for expenditure—and the local authority which has to bear that expenditure if one magistrates' courts committee is dealing with one local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some cities and towns found, in the Local Government Act 1972 which amended local government boundaries and which some of us remember to our intense displeasure, that their magistrates' courts committees had been abolished. The city bench was represented by the county magistrates' courts committee. So the county magistrates' courts committee found itself dealing with the diverse problems of city benches and rural benches, and a number of local authorities. There has been some feeling, too, subsequently among city benches that representation of the cities on magistrates' courts committees was disproportionate to the size of the population that they served or the amount of work that they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not voicing any local complaint from my constituency, which is a metropolitan district. Metropolitan districts have their own magistrates' courts committees. That is one of the anomalies and one of the things that surprised the non-metropolitan districts, because they could not see the distinction between them and the metropolitan districts for this purpose. The proposal was not made by the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee. Certainly, it does not meet with the approval of the Justices' Clerks Society, which would like to see things done differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
An amendment to that effect was moved in another place at the Committee and Report stages of the Local Government, Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill 1980. For the benefit of those members of the Committee who wish to hasten away and refer to the debates, they took place on 15 and 30 October 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is still a sore question. Initially, the Justices' Clerks Society had listed the authorities that would like to have their own magistrates' courts committees, but do not now have them. At first it occurred to me that we might put forward a new clause in that form. But, before I had troubled anyone with the matter, it struck me that that might lead to problems of hybridity. As I did not have your expertise in the procedures of the House, Mr. English, I decided to shy away from that. Instead, I proposed that we should confer power on the Lord Chancellor to order that a particular district should have its own magistrates' courts committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that if the Government had made that proposal, I would be moving a probing amendment to ask what kind of use they intended to make of it. I am making the proposal, and I have indicated what kind of use I hope they will make of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea that anyone, including me, is an expert on hybridity will not be well received in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the relevant factors in regard to the position at the moment are these. In a non-metropolitan county there is one magistrates' courts committee for the whole county. We were talking about that on another new clause. Therefore, one magistrates' courts committee does work with one local authority, and it works both ways. One local authority has to deal only with one magistrates' courts committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the new clause were added to the Bill, the difference is that there could be more than one magistrates' courts committee within the boundaries of one local authority. Therefore, it would then be possible for one non-metropolitan district to have its own separate courts committee, which would presumably be financed by that district council, whereas the whole of the rest of that non-metropolitan county would have one magistrates' courts committee which dealt with the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right about that, it is sufficient to show what a muddle one could have. Far from preserving the one body dealing with one body syndrome to which the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) referred and which prevails now, it would break into that and there might well be two different systems, both for administration and for financing, in one non-metropolitan county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be answers to those questions. This is a preliminary canter round this course. However, it is clear that one would want to hear the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
views of all those concerned. I know the views of some of them. I know the feeling of some county boroughs. I understand it. I represent what was a county borough and it was proud of its status. Therefore, I understand that side, but I dare say there is an argument the other way as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall content myself with drawing to the attention of the Committee the facts that I have mentioned, which indicate that the matter is not as simple as it might look at first sight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to treat the debate as a short canter round the course. If the Committee wishes to pursue the matter, it calls for a great deal of consideration which could not possibly be accorded to the proposals during the passage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must follow as a matter of logic that if a petty sessional division and a local authority are no longer contiguous, as unhappily they are not, either the magistrates' courts committee will be dealing with more than one local authority or the local authority will be dealing with more than one magistrates' courts committee. Perhaps we have to see where the balance of convenience would lie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there are any circumstances in which a magistrates' courts committee deals with more than one local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then perhaps I have misunderstood. I thought that some magistrates' courts committees dealt both with a county council and with a city council within that county area. Since we do not have to arrive at a decision today, we may all be able to inform ourselves on the facts. If I have misunderstood, I apologise to the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that we shall need to ascertain the views of a number of bodies which at present are not known to us, but we must not take refuge too readily in a necessity for consultation. This matter has been discussed at some length over quite a long time. It was discussed fairly fully in another place as long ago as 1980. Therefore, I should have hoped that the Government might have pursued some of those consultations by now. I shall certainly try to pursue them further between now and Report, but it is a matter on which the House should take a decision during the passage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are strong arguments for doing that on Report rather than in Committee, because a number of hon.

	<p>"In section 5 of the Guardianship of Minors Act 1971, there shall be inserted a new subsection as follows—</p>
	<p>'2A. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that any of the persons specified in subsection (3) of section 33 of the Children Act 1975 is a person having parental rights for the purposes of subsection (1) above'.".—	<i>[Mr. Archer.]</i></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this proposal to deal with a specific case which came to my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe (Mrs. Dunwoody), on which she then asked my advice. May I first simply recount the facts? An unmarried lady had a child. She then had a nervous breakdown and was unable to care for the child. Her mother cared for the child and brought her up as her own child, and the parents and child were almost like sisters. Later, the child's mother died, and the grandmother continued to care for the child. Up to that stage, the father of the child had shown very little interest. Then he married, and now he suggests that he may at some time wish to have the child to live with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that situation, the question arises: what are the rights of the grandmother? The courts will have in mind the interests of the child, and we have always been told that they are paramount. But the interests of the grandmother should not be ignored, and certainly her wishes might be taken into account in deciding what is best for the child, since she is clearly best acquainted with the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, what legal remedy is available to the grandmother to ensure that she has some rights in the matter? The adoption procedure is not suitable. The children's department has indicated that it would not encourage an elderly widow:o adopt a child. Wardship proceedings are expensive and, as the grandmother cannot show that the child is in imminent danger, she is not likely to obtain a civil aid certificate to pursue them. It seems that the case is made for custodianship proceedings under the Children Act 1975. Those proceedings have not yet been brought into force. Perhaps the Solicitor-General can say whether and when it is proposed to bring them into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recollect a debate with a Home Office Minister on an earlier occasion in connection with similar proposals. He said that the Home Office did not intend to bring them into force ever, which struck me as constitutionally very surprising. If Parliament decides that something should happen but leaves it to the Government to bring it into force, surely that is done to give the Government an opportunity to make arrangements before bringing it into force. The Government should not use that opportunity to say that they disagree with Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another possibility is proceedings under the Guardianship of Minors Act 1971. Such proceedings would be open to the grandmother only if she
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
could show that she was the person having parental rights. I understand that there is doubt about that and that different views have been given to her by way of advice. I do not presume to give my view, but the purpose of the new clause is to meet the not unreasonable anxieties of grandparents who may have devoted years of their lives and a great deal of love to the care of their grandchildren. It is intended primarily to remove that doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that the new clause referred to a specific case. I shall not seek refuge in consultation, but I think that it is a highly tehnical point. There is a danger that the new clause may restrict the courts' discretion in deciding who may be allowed to make an application under section 5. It would be much better if I saw the facts precisely as set out in the 	<i>Official Report</i> and gave the right hon. and learned Gentleman a considered and complete answer as soon as possible.

	<div class='title'>BENEFITS FOR INJURED PERSONS FROM PUBLIC FUNDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) In an action under the Law of England and Wales or the Law of Northern Ireland for damages for personal injuries (including any such action arising out of a contract) any saving to the injured person which is attributable to his having received or being eligible to- have received from public funds as a result of his injuries any benefits (whether contributory or non-contributory).
	<ol>
	<li>which are within the scope of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946 as amended and Orders and Regulations thereunder or</li>
	<li>which comprise sickness benefit or invalidity or injury benefit or supplementary benefit or mobility allowance or unemployment benefit or disablement benefit or gratuity</li>
</ol>
then the same shall be set off against any income lost by him as a result of his injuries for the first five years beginning with the time when the cause of action arose, and the amount of such saving shall be reduced by the amount paid by or on behalf of the injured person by way of any contributions to public funds under the National Health and Insurance Act for a period within the twelve month period beginning with 6th April of the fiscal year occurring 24 months prior to the beginning of the fiscal year in which the cause of action arose (' the relevant period'), equivalent to the period, on a day for day basis, for which the benefit is paid, calculated on an average of the contributions paid during the relevant period, provided that such reduction shall not exceed the amount of contributions paid for the whole of the relevant period.</p>
	<p>This subsection shall not be taken as requiring both the gross amount of the damages before taking into account the said rights, and the net amount after taking them into account to be found separately.</p>
	<p>(2) In determining the value of the said rights there shall be disregarded any increases of an industrial disablement pension in respect of the need of constant attendance.</p>

	<p>(3) The reference in subsection (1) of this section to a saving, shall in cases where the damages otherwise recoverable are subject to reduction under the law relating to contributory negligence, or are limited by any Act or by contract, be taken as referring to a saving of the total damages which would have been recoverable apart from the reduction or limitation.</p>
	<p>(4) In an action for damages for personal injuries(including any such action arising out of a contract), regard shall be had in determining the reasonableness of any expenses for the cost of medical treatment and care, to the possibility of avoiding those expenses or part of them by taking advantage of facilities available under the National Health Service Act 1946 or the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 or of any corresponding facilities in Northern Ireland provided that the equivalent treatment and care is available under those Acts at the time and place it is reasonably required and the test of what is reasonable shall be determined by medical criteria.</p>
	<p>(5) In assessing damages in respect of a person's death in any action under the Fatal Accidents Acts or under the Carriage by Air Act 1932 there shall not be taken into account any right to benefit resulting from that person's death.</p>
	<p>(6) For the purposes of this section:—
	<ol>
	<li>the expression ' benefit' means benefit under the National Insurance Acts 1946 or any corresponding Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland;</li>
	<li>expressions used in the National Insurance Acts 1946 for any description of benefit under those Acts have the same meaning as in those Acts except that they include also the like benefit if any under any corresponding Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland;</li>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals in my new clauses are matters of considerable importance and interest. They seek to put into law a principle by which the State can obtain indemnity or redress from a wrongdoer. For example, if someone, crashed a motor vehicle with resultant physical damage to another person and the State had to pay compensation, it would be able to reclaim that money, or a proportion of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses are self-explanatory, so I shall not take too much of the Committee's time going through them word by word. It would be unfair and perhaps boring to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall mentioning in my speech in the Second Reading Committee that on 1 April the Department of Health and Social Security issued a press release which stated that arrangements for the costs of recovery under the Road Traffic Act 1972 were being scrutinised. I am told that that scrutinising committee has taken an interest in these new clauses. The committee seems to agree that, if only on principle, a situation such as this would greatly ameliorate the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a copy of a letter from a London teaching hospital, the name of which I cannot give the Committee because it has been effectively blanked out. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We send about 500 emergency treatment fee invoices per annum with a potential income from them of £5,000. However, because of the seven-day rule within which we have to notify the driver, approximately 30 per cent, of these claims are not paid and in addition we have approximately two to three cases a year where we are able to invoice insurance companies for inpatient and outpatient treatment."</p></blockquote>
The Committee knows that very few claims are made under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1972, for a variety of reasons, but perhaps largely because in a significant number of cases the resultant return from those claims is not sufficient to warrant the claim being made in the first place. This is the basis of principle on which I tabled new clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would replace section 2 of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948. At present, a person who claims loss of earnings in a personal injuries claim must deduct half the amount that he has received from social security for his claim for loss of earnings. The reason is that he must not be over-compensated and receive benefit from the State and from the tortfeasor for the same accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a growing voice over a number of years for the whole of the benefits to be deducted in a claim for loss of earnings. I quote the much-mentioned Pearson report of 1978, the Government's 1981 White Paper and the Solicitor-General himself, who said on Second Reading that the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
had not yet decided whether to offset the full amount, but that clause 5 of the Bill sought to reduce the claim by the amount paid to or for the benefit of, an injured person whilst being treated in an institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 12 seeks to offset the full amount of social security benefits against the loss of earnings claim. It also ensures that the claimant receives the amount that he contributed towards that benefit. These figures can be worked out easily on a day-to-day basis because the assessment is made on the fiscal year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 341 of the Pearson report's recommendation relating to subsection (4) states in part:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a plaintiff decides to seek private treatment for his injuries when the same treatment would have been equally available under the National Health Service, we do not think that the defendant can be reasonably expected to meet the cost."</p></blockquote>
We include subsection (4) in the new clause to ensure that the treatment that the patient receives is treatment that is within reasonable limits. We have a Welfare State and a National Health Service. I submit that the Health Service should be used on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 13 deals with a principle, namely, the right of recovery of public funds. It is, in effect, a declaratory clause. The principle was aired in the Second Reading Committee, so I shall not labour the Committee with details, save to say that the clause spells out the right of the Welfare State to make a recovery for moneys that it expends on one of its insured against that member of the public who, by his fault, and breach of duty, caused the Welfare State to make those payments. The new clause does not make new law, nor does it extend any principle which does not already exist at common law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Health Service should be just that. It is a national service and should provide free medical treatment to all. The DHSS should be able to provide free to all benefits which are realistically in line with the cost of living. We are suffering severe financial shortages which cannot be resolved other than by increasing taxation. That would be an unpopular move among an already overtaxed general public. The new clause would return a considerable amount of much needed money to the Welfare State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 14 covers the amounts of money that the Welfare State could claim as expenditure in the case of personal injury. It is the same formula which exists under the Road Traffic Act 1972. The figures in the new clause are arbitrary, as are all figures used in statute. They are subject to change by the Solicitor-General as and when ncessary, depending upon the relevant costs at the time of the claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 15 provides the means by which moneys expended by the Walfare State can be recovered. Any person who has suffered personal injuries at the hands of another or through the fault of, or substantially the fault of another, is able to bring a claim against that wrongdoer for his personal damages. That is well established. He is also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
able to add to his own claim the claim of another person affected by the accident. One example is a wife's loss of earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, it would be an easy matter for that person to add the Welfare State's claim to his own. The reason he does not do so is that there is no duty upon him and he is not asked to do so. The new clause would impose a duty to give notice in writing to the Welfare State that he is to make a claim which will enable the Welfare State to' inform him of the amounts it would wish him to claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would also be a duty on a person to include the Welfare's State's claim with his own and to pursue its recovery as he would his own. It wuold ensure that the claim could be made in a proper, effectiv and efficient way and that any loopholes that might arise are fairly carefully covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 16 sets out the duties of the appropriate body, which is the particular branch of the Welfare State involved. The duties must, in fairness, be equally divided. The appropriate body would advise the would-be claimant within a reasonable time of the amounts expended by it. There would be a specfic cost indemnity. The claimant should be able to deduct his proportionate costs of including the appropriate body's claim with his own out of the damages awarded to that body. It would be unfair to make the claimant pay administrative costs in order to claim moneys expended by others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 17 sets out the amount that may be claimed by the Welfare State, which will be determined by the liability of the tortfeasor, as with all other personal injury claims. The tortfeasor will not be penalised or made liable for the Welfare State claims irrespective of liability. That is allowed for under sections 145 and 156 of the Road Traffic Act 1972. Should lability not be agreed between the claimant and the tortfeasor before settlement of the claim, the claimant and the Welfare State should reach an agreement. If they are not able to agree, it will be for determination by the court. That would mean that when a settlement was reached and payment made to the claimant, the Welfare State would be entitled to only a proportion of its claim for expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Alexander 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newark)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument, and I do not necessarily disagree with it. But can he assure the Committee that nothing in the new clauses requires a person to pay money to whoever, without it being proved that he was negligent? Under the 1972 Act there have been cases in which someone has required treatment in hospital, and soon afterwards, the other party involved in the accident who may not have felt that he was guilty of negligence, has received the Bill. Can the hon. Gentleman assure the Committee that nothing in his proposals would require someone to make such payments unless he were judged guilty of negligence in ether the criminal or civil courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not our intention. I shall digress briefly to pay a well-deserved compliment to my colleagues who spent some months drafting the new clauses. Most hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
Members are not, and certainly I am not, capable of drafting such a complicated and detailed set of new clauses. I am more than grateful to my colleagues for their assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, it is not our intention that the normal process of apportioning liability should be followed. The new clauses do not seek to open up a new means of collecting money, nor to enable people to put in bills to which, they are not entitled. I hope that that lulls the hon. Gentleman's fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 18, no amount paid by the tort-reasor to the claimant is to be considered a settlement for the Welfare State's disbursement without the appropriate body's written approval. When considering approval of the settlement, the Welfare State must take into account the claimant's immediate and future circumstances and the circumstances surrounding the claim. Should approval not be given within 28 days the claimant can settle that part of the claim which is not part of the Welfare State's claim, without prejudicing the Welfare State's claim. That means that settlement is not held up unnecessarily just because the Welfare State does not approve of the offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the claimant has a right to his part of the moneys. An amicable agreement has been reached on that. It would be grossly unfair to expect die claimant to wait until such a time as discussions between the Welfare State and the other party had come to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 21 would enable the tortfeasor to settle the Welfare State's claim separately, before settling the claimant's claim without an admission of liability. Many insurance companies may wish to do that and to settle the claimant's claim at a later date. The present provisions for recovery of NHS costs under the Road Traffic Act 1972 fail because there is no incentive for a tortfeasor—or his insurer—to settle the claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be glad to know that I am fast approaching the end of my complicated discourse. I said that I would endeavour to talk about principles rather than details and I hope that I have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 22 specifies to whom payment should be made and provides for the Secretary of State for Social Services to appoint a receipts master.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 24 states that those who have a statutory duty to be insured for a third party under the Road Traffic Act 1972 or by the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 should ensure that their insurance covers any liability for Welfare State disbursements. The only areas of negligence which have been deliberately excluded from the new clauses are injuries caused by the injured persons themselves, to whatever extent, and injuries caused by the paying appropriate body itself—that is medical negligence. One could not in fairness include that. The interpretation of " personal injury" is taken directly from section 2 of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses are workable and could be incorporated in the Bill. Their principle is important
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
to the continuing need to distribute fairly the wrongdoer's liability for payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard of a claim for special damages where more than half the amount was unclaimable because the money had been distributed by the Welfare State. It had been distributed by the National Health Service in medical care and the supply of special medical equipment for the remaining part of the patient's life because the patient was off sick for a long time. Consequently those who insured the wrongdoer—the person who had caused the injury, about which there was no doubt—got away with a considerable sum of money because no claim could be made on them. They had no liability to pay the Walfare State for the money that it had disbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important principle. In these times of tight finance we should decide that the National Health Service should not be burdened unnecessarily by paying the bills when moneys to pay the bills could be reclaimed in other ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had the opportunity to chat with the hon. Gentleman and I am happy to confirm what I said to him personally. The Government are sympathetic to the principles which have led to the tabling of the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government agree that those responsible for accidents should not expect the State to pay for their wrongdoing, whether in the form of treatment under the National Health Service, or in cash benefits under the social security system. The Lord Chancellor is on record as having expressed that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer my warm congratulations to the hon. Gentleman and to those who assisted him for devising the scheme. Like the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer), I have sat where he now sits and have had to produce a good deal of drafting with such assistance as I could get. So I am familiar with the difficulties. It is a splendid effort to cover the many facets of the problem with which we wish to deal. So, what I am about to say does not detract in any way from what I have just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be remarkable, almost beyond belief, for any system intrinsically as complicated as this to be dealt with without the benefit of the government machine and the parliamentary draftsmen. Consequently, there are a substantial number of defects. 1 have shown the hon. Gentleman a list of those which I would develop, were it desired, but I can now add that when the Committee has finished I shall be happy to hand him a copy of the documents that I showed him at lunchtime. He will then have on record the defects that I would have developed if I thought that this was the appropriate place to do so. With the benefit of that document the hon. Gentleman may then consult those who have assisted him to devise the scheme and consider the means of resolving the defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Chancellor and I are on record, on behalf of the Government, as subscribing to the objectives. That the scheme has been devised in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
such detail and presented in this way means that there will be all that material for the government machine who are discussing the matter to consider. That can be only useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government intend to bring forward their own legislative proposals as soon as consultations with those involved have produced a workable scheme. I congratulate those who have devised the new clauses and thank the hon. Gentleman for putting them on record so that we may all have the benefit of studying them. Ithink that that is what they hoped to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an important new clause, but it does not necessarily involve a fundamental change in the administration of justice. I have an imprecise interest in this as, apart from being an independent-minded Back Bencher, I am a solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes) as well as myself. I regret that she is not moving it because she does not even have the slight interest that I was forced to declare. It would have been better if someone who was not a member of the legal profession—I emphasise the legal profession and not two parts of two professions—had moved the new clause, although I make no apology for being a member of the legal profession. It should not be seen as a matter of dispute between two sides of the profession, because it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All sides of the profession believe that it is a modest change in the administration of justice in England and Wales. I pray in aid the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Hunt) in the proceedings on the Supreme Court Act 1981. He said that it was a modest change. It is no more than that. The principle that only the Bar should be eligible for judicial appointments was breached in 1971 when the Courts Act came into existence. It

was argued then that a solicitor would possibly never have the experience necessary to act as a judge, cither than a coroner or magistrate. Solicitors were coroners or magistrates prior to that. It was argued then that solicitors did not have experience of advocacy in the quarter sessions, the Assizes—or the Crown courts as they became—to fit them to be judges in those tribunals. That was argued and discussed, and I think that it was something of an experiment whereby solicitors ultimately become judges in the tribunals to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experiment has continued for almost a decade, and it is fair to say that the present Lord Chancellor, who was the Lord Chancellor then, has concluded that the circuit judges and the recorders who have come from the ranks of solicitors have proved themselves extremely capable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to have been proved beyond peradventure that those who start their legal life in the role of a solicitor can become competent and, indeed, excellent judges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I say now—I trust that the Committee will support my view—is that having proved an ability to be judges in the courts that I have mentioned, it is anomalous that such judges are not eligible under the law for elevation to the High Court bench. Here, I thank my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for his kindness in agreeing to discuss the matter with me and others. While there may be division of opinion between us it is not on the basis of which side of the profession one comes from but whether it is a necessary prerequisite for a High Court judge to have had experience as an advocate in that particular court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with that, I shall quote from a letter of 21 June from Sir David Napley to 	<i>The Times.</i> As far as I am aware, there has been no response, either in the columns of that august organ or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir David Napley, who is an eminent solicitor, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government, in support of the Bar, have raised only one inadequate argument against making solicitors, who have proved their ability as circuit judges, eligible for elevation to the High Court bench. That extensive experience as an advocate in the High Court is a. prerequisite to appointment.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>At the passage of the Courts Act a similar argument was raised … in regard to the lower courts, namely that a circuit judge could only satisfactorily preside if he had previously had wide experience in jury trials. The Lord Chancellor, fair minded as he can always be, changed his mind and made such appointments possible. This disposed of that argument, as confirmed by his recent acknowledgement that solicitor circuit judges have proved to be extremely good.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Since 1971 eight circuit judges, all necessarily barristers, have been appointed to the High Court; before that a number were appointed from the equivalent county court bench. What has been studiously avoided in argument, is that whilst nearly all of these, as circuit practitioners, may on occasion have appeared before High Court judges, few (if any) had practised extensively, if at all, in the High Court at the Royal Courts of Justice.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Moreover, many eminent High Court judges had, before appointment, practised in most limited fields and had to adapt to new pursuits. Of the many involved examples are the late Lord Widgery, Lord Chief Justice, a former solicitor and primarily a specialist in town and country planning, and Lord Donovan, a tax specialist.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Of an earlier generation Humphries and Byrne J.J. hardly ever appeared in the High Court and certainly not in civil causes, and there have been recent appointments of a similar nature. A large number of High Court judges who have competently conducted serious criminal trials have not, at least for years before their appointment, if ever, appeared in a criminal court."</p></blockquote>
I quoted Sir David Napley extensively to support the argument that I advanced in the early part of my speech. There has been no response to Sir David's infinitely important arguments, not even by my hon. and learned Friend although he may respond in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be said that the argument comes both from an eminent solicitor and from one who is much less eminent—myself. If my arguments were supported only by solicitors I too, would query them. But that is not so. Many members of the Bar take a similar view—that is, since the original principle was propounded in 1971, there is no reason why it should be avoided now without proper evidence that experience in the High Court is absolutely necessary before ex-solicitor judges can be selected for the High Court bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that people who begin as solicitors and who then became judges should necessarily be appointed to the High Court bench; merely that they should be eligible for that preferment if the Lord Chancellor, himself a barrister, chooses to appoint them on the evidence available to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my Second Reading speech, I briefly referred to a letter from His Honour Judge G. G. A. Whitehead, D.F.C., which he wrote to the Law Society and which he allowed to be quoted. In that letter of 8 May, he said that he was pleased to note that the matter was being taken up. He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present position is anomalous, and in effect creates two tiers of Circuit Judge, i.e. those who are, and those who are not eligible for elevation. This is acknowledged by one or two of my brethren who have raised the matter with me. I believe Circuit Judges who have been barristers take the realistic view that in order to remove the apparent anomaly, Circuit Judges as a body should be elegible—it does not mean that a rash of appointments would be made, because, even now, it is rare for a Circuit Judge to be elevated.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would not be right for me to comment on the Lord Chancellor's reasons for opposing, although I think the arguments are fairly obvious. The simple remedy would be for the bar (to ex-solicitors) to be removed".</p></blockquote>
I wish to make a point about the emphasis on "ex-solicitors ". We are not arguing that solicitors, as such, should be eligible for the High Court bench, but that judges should be eligible. They are not solicitors. They have moved to being circuit judges. They are no more part of the solicitors' profession than anyone else. They are judges. It seems a slur on those who have been deemed fit to judge their fellow men in certain courts that they should not be considered fit, and have their credentials examined, to judge on the High Court bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is appropriate to tell the Committee that Judge Whitehead is an ex-solicitor who would benefit by the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Judge Whitehead was a solicitor and he might benefit from the new clause. I can then

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
assist my hon. and learned Friend by quoting the next paragraph of his letter. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At 65, I feel that I can take a broad view, because 1 am clearly not a candidate! If, however, I was confronted by the situation, I would certainly not regard myself capable of filling the role of a Judge of the Q.B.D. or the Chancery Division, perhaps for the reason the Lord Chancellor has mentioned. I believe, however, that any Circuit Judge who has sat regularly in County Courts for five years would have little difficulty in opening with an appointment to the Family Division, which nowadays includes doing some crime and Q.B. work. I believe, incidentally, that there are Judges in the Family Division now who have not had that sort of experience which the Lord Chancellor seems to consider essential!"</p></blockquote>
It seems fairly obvious that Judge Whitehead is in no position, and has no wish, to take preferment as my hon. and learned Friend suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose in quoting the letter is to show that there are circuit judges, some of whom started as solicitors and some as barristers, who believe that there is an enormous anomaly and that it would do no harm, and cause no earth-shaking consequences, to allow this modest new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous debate, a judgment of Lord Blackburn was quoted. I mentioned Lord Blackburn on Second Reading and I am much obliged to the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) for reminding me. In 1859, when the briefless Northern barrister, Mr. Blackburn, was appointed to the High Court bench, 	<i>The Times</i> asked " Who is Mr. Blackburn?" It seems ironic that, more than 100 years later, an ex-Law Officer, a learned and much respected Member of the House, should quote in aid of his argument on a serious matter on the Bill the judgment of a man who had never practised as an advocate in the High Court. Perhaps members of the Committee who are not involved in this internecine wrangle might bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Blackburn never had a brief. He was known as a law reporter. Such work as he had in the North of England was chambers work, advising on tax, wills and probate and such matters which humble solicitors like myself fail to understand without the aid of such men. He had never been in the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet he was one of the most admired, respected and remembered judges of all time. I quoted from Sir David Napley's letter so I do not rely simply on the activities of an eminent nineteenth century judge. I have given adequate evidence from Sir David's letter to show that many other judges are highly respected; their views are sought, they have never committed themselves to a career of advocacy in the High Court. Apparently that is the major argument that my hon. and learned Friend adduces against the possibility of ex-solicitors becoming High Court judges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the matter was considered in the Supreme Court Bill last year my hon. and learned Friend rightly said that the subject should be discussed and debated within the profession. It was discussed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
and debated by the legal profession but, unfortunately, no agreement could be reached. Discussion went beyond the realms of the legal profession into a number of newspapers. With the help of others I looked through the press cuttings of national, provincial and local newspapers. So far as I can ascertain there was not one adverse press comment about my proposal. That, again, is significant. The matter is not so complex and so confined within the legal profession that no one outside can understand it. The arguments are fairly obvious. Yet not one newspaper in the country concluded that my proposal was undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the law, the courts—and the High Court in particular—is to serve the public and to give the best possible justice within the imperfections of man. Judges are subject to imperfections. That is why we have courts of appeal. Surely it must be right that within those imperfections we should seek to obtain the best possible legal brains and the best possible deciders of issues that divide men, companies and, occasionally, countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes said that no solicitor could possibly reach mat eminent position and hope to achieve the degree of perfection which is possible because he never has to think on his feet or speak the words. Again, I know that this was argued the last time that the matter was. debated a year or so ago. From my experience, solicitors do sit through High Court cases and act as advocates in reserve. In some cases they act as advocates who pull the strings, as it were. Of course, no one in the Committee or, that T am aware of, in the House would be so involved. During previous discusson of this matter it was argued that that was not the case. It was said that senior partners dealing with litigation do not sit through High Court proceedings and that the technicalities were left to a managing clerk—legal executives as they are now known. That is occasionally so, but in my experience a senior partner who is a solicitor would remain throughout the proceedings of a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the suggestion in the counterargument that High Court actions are so fundamentally different from county court or Crown court actions that there can be no bridging of the gap. I do not accept the implication in the argument that criminal work is, by definition, much easier than civil work in the High Court. That does not seeim to be true. It would certainly be true to say that a High Court action is more likely to be complicated and may involve more difficult points of law than a criminal case in the Crown Court, but it suggested that circuit judges never have to deal with extremely complicated matters of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) was present when I made my Second Reading speech, which I thought was better than this one, because it was shorter, more concise and made a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall bear the hon. Gentleman's warning in mind. No reason has yet been given why those who started their lives as solicitors and become judges should be debarred from further advancement. It is not for them that argue this case, but for the public. It is the right of those who have to argue their cases before the courts to have the best judges available. When there are 40,000 solicitors and some 4,700 barristers, it is inconceivable that among those solicitors there should not be some who might make very capable and excellent High Court judges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again a new clause is presented without the real arguments being given to the Committee. I want to advance them as dispassionately as I can at the beginning of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of whether, among the 40,000 solicitors, there are people worthy of going on the High Court Bench. The Lord Chief Justice was a solicitor for most of his working life and the Vice-Chancellor of the Chancery Division started life as a solicitor. That is not the issue. I beg my hon. Friends who are speaking for that half of the profession to face the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This case does not depend on a series of quotations from letters by one judge. There are 340 circuit judges. I want to add this, in case anything that I said might read as if I thought that Judge Whitehead was actuated by personal interest, because nothing could have been further from my intention. I thought that it would be fair for my hon. Friend to say that that judge spoke from experience, first of all, as a solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the matter of Sir David Napley, my hon. Friend described it as an internecine wrangle and perhaps let a cat out of the bag. Is that how he regards it? I do not regard it as that at all and I have gone to immense pains to stop it appearing to the public as an internecine wrangle. I shall go on trying to do so until the last word is said on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of a very good reason why no reply was published to Sir David Napley's letter. For one, the other side of the profession did not want to get into a public wrangle. I could draw attention to the absurd suggestion that Humphries and Byrne had no High Court experience. They were chosen as the two advocates who had appeared in one big trial after another and so had gained the experience suitable to permit them to try all sorts of cases in the criminal courts. However, I do not want to enter into a wrangle about who said what and why someone did not reply. What on earth have those matters to do with the issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said, without mentioning figures, that many members of the Bar share his view. I hope that he will tell the Committee—and not leave it to me to do what I do not want to do—that by no means is there unanimity on his side. I am not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
talking about a small number of people on the fringe. He might give us some idea of what the leaders of his profession think if he puts his case on that basis. I do not want to put it on that basis. My real complaint about the way in which he puts his case is that he does not attack the fundamental considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about who should be entitled to participate in a professional monopoly. In order to decide that, one has to get to the very roots. I suggest to the Committee that the only grounds on which any professional monopoly can be acceptable are, first, that the job calls for special skill and experience, and, secondly, that in order to protect the public only those who have the necessary skill and experience should be permitted to perform that job. I do not believe that anyone would quarrel with either of those propositions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those who take my hon. Friend's line will face up to the fact that it follows not just anyone can ask to participate. We must not be hypocritical about the matter; the Law Society, no doubt for good reasons, is asking that solicitors should be entitled to participate in that further sphere of legal work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one can ask to participate unless he or she has, and shows that he or she has, the qualities that alone can make the monopoly justifiable in the public interest—the skill and experience to do the job properly. I stress that no one should ask to be considered unless they not only have but are willing to show that they have both the experience and ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made my observations on the basis of the public interest and I remind the Committee that the Benson Committee to the surprise of many of us and possibly to the surprise of some of its members, came to the clear-cut and unanimous conclusion that the legal profession should continue to be organised in two separate branches. The arguments for separation were fully canvassed and considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason that the Benson Committee reached that conclusion was that a legal system which provides both the best service for the public and is most in the interests of the administration of justice needs a highly specialised and skilled group of advocates. Many of the arguments that the Committee heard related to that and to- how it was because there is a separate Bar, which gains most of its experience in the High Court, that we have such a body of advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was not the Bar putting forward a claim to protect itself. If it had been, there might have been a different result. Paragraph 17.14 of Benson states that of the large number who gave evidence
	<br><blockquote><p>"a small minority advocated fusion."</p></blockquote>
In dealing with the other aspect, paragraph 17.28 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A large number of undertakings, in both the private and public sectors, gave evidence in support of the present system. Amongst lawyers who gave evidence, there was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
a clear weight of opinion against fusion. With the exception of the Legal Action Group and the United Lawyers' Association, all the professional bodies who submitted evidence to us on this topic were against fusion in principle."</p></blockquote>
That includes the Law Society. Having looked at it again, I am reminded that it included independent submissions to that effect from quite a number of local law societies, all of which supported the argument that we need a separate Bar because that is how we get the different skills and experience. If the same skills and experience were involved there would be no need to have separate parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 17.46 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to the administration of justice, the weight of evidence is strongly to the effect that a two-branch profession is more likely than a fused one to ensure the high quality of advocacy which is indispensable, so long as our system remains in its present form, to secure the proper quality of justice. These considerations lead us to the unanimous conclusion that it is in the public interest for the legal profession to be organised, as at present, in two branches."</p></blockquote>
I stress that the essence of that is that those who practise as advocates all their life acquire a special skill—if it is in them to acquire it; if they survive, they acquire it—and a very special experience. I stress also- that the Committee's conclusion is that what it recommends is in the public interest and necessary for the proper administration of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that—and I doubt whether anyone would quarrel with it—it follows that there has to be a dividing line. At present there is an overlap. Solicitors have very large areas in which they have a monopoly. We make no complaint about that, so long as they show that a special expertise is required that we do not obtain through our practices but which is necessary for the protection of the public. Some other areas are far wider. There is a little bit at the top and, in between, are overlapping areas. But the dividing line, which everyone accepts to be the stopping point, is the right of audience in the High Court. Unless that is maintained, there will not be two halves of the profession. We all accept that. Up to there, some are exclusive and some overlap. Everyone agrees that the solicitors do not suggest that there is any question of a solicitor moving straight to the High Court bench from practice as a solicitor. It is accepted that he will not have gained the necessary practice or experience, or demonstrated that to anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obvious reason for that is the clear difference between High Court practice and practice in the other courts. My hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter) failed to see the difference, but perhaps that is why he does not follow the argument. I am not being critical when I say that his practice might lie elsewhere; that he might be an absolute expert in the Liverpool magistrates' courts, and do a marvellous job there, or in the circuits. But I do not think my hon. Friend could have expressed the view that there is not such a great difference in practice if he had firsthand knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I wonder whether people realise just what it is like to appear in the High Court. It is rather like appearing in Parliament. There is no hiding place. Once a person is on his feet, he is there on the spot. In the High Court, an advocate may spend days opening a case and putting forward propositions. I challenge my hon. Friend to find something similar in the county courts or the Crown courts. The propositions sound fine when they are put forward, but one knows, too—and it is causing a great thumping in the heart—that each of those propositions will be tackled in the following weeks. The advocate had better be right, for he will be tackled by advocates at least as good as himself and, probably better. The case will be umpired by someone who is better than both of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no hiding place. Once an advocate is on his feet, he must cope with all that. People may say, " There is good man." If he survives long enough, he will get experience. But if he makes a slip, the word goes around and people say " He fancies himself. How is he going to get on in this case? " But that is the sort of life it is, and all advocates accept it. It is a completely different form of lifestyle, and I speak as an advocate who has done a lot of work in circuit courts as well as the High Court, in a lifetime's practice. I can assure my hon. Friend that they are quite different experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following from that, it is for the movers of the new clause to show how a solicitor who takes a job on a county court bench can gain, or show that he already has, the necessary skill and experience. By going on to the circuit bench, he has deprived himself of the opportunity to gain such experience. I can see no way out of that problem. Experience cannot be gained except by participating in the work. If he chooses to go on to the circuit bench before participating, there is no way to gain, or show that he has the skill and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that such experience can be gained by sitting as a circuit judge. But, with great respect to all members of the circuit bench, and to my hon. Friend, that will not bear examination. As I have just said if someone becomes a recorder straight away or goes on to the circuit bench, there is no way in which he can get the necessary experience, or show that he can do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said a little about practice in the High Court to illustrate the point. I assure members of the Committee who are without experience of the High Court that I have not exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next consideration—I hope that members of the Committee will observe that I have not touched on a point which could be related in any way to an internecine wrangle—is that when a person is appointed a High Court judge he must be able from that minute to try any case that comes along, no matter how difficult it is or different from what he has been doing in the whole of his previous legal career. There is no question of a training period. There is no question of saying " We'll give him some easy ones to start with." Life does not work like that at that end of the scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
This matter must also be looked at from the point of view of the public interest. When the Lord Chancellor is deciding who to invite to go on to the High Court bench, he must have the public interest very much in mind. Blow the interests of the individuals who might or might not be put on the High Court bench; the Lord Chancellor must ask himself " If I make this man a High Court judge, can he try every case with justice to both sides? " He can answer that question in the affirmative only if he can say "This person has proved by doing it that he has experience of what he is going to do and, by standing up and doing it, he has shown that he can do it and do it properly."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a man chooses to go on to the circuit bench before he has that experience—it is a free country, and he has a free choice, so he does not have to do so—I suggest that there is a powerful argument that those will be the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one other comment on this matter. It is said that if a man shows himself to be a good circuit judge, it follows that he will be a good High Court judge. But it does not follow. It is like saying that because a man has shown himself to be good at general surgery, he can be put on to hole-in-the-heart surgery. One might say that the man has been so good at general surgery that he will be moved and trained for another four or five years, after which he might do hole-in-the-heart surgery. But to take a man straight from general surgery and say " Now you are in charge of hole-in-the-heart surgery ", which is the analogy, will not stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another aspect of the matter. My hon. Friend referred to changes that were made in 1972. It is a fact that substantial new opportunities were afforded to solicitors then. I was one of the principal advocates of that in this House. I am proud that it was a Conservative Lord Chancellor who implemented that, and I am proud that I had a part in supporting those changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two new opportunities were accorded to solicitors. One was for them to be recorders. The other was for them to become circuit judges after they had been recorders for three years. Of course, recorder-ship is a special job. It is only part-time. One is invited to sit on each occasion. It terminates after three years, anyway, so one can experiment a little there. Even so, the Lord Chancellor does not appoint anyone unless he has reports from all those who arc consulted—the consultations go very wide—that the person has experience of the kinds of cases he is likely to be given to try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For circuit judges, it was a big extension. However, that can be justified on exactly the same argument as I am now putting forward, because solicitors have the right of audience in the county court and have had it for a long time. When I was a beginner at the Bar, one day we would have a solicitor against us and the next day it would be a barrister. Therefore, for a long time the solicitor has had both the opportunities that I consider necessary before a man can suggest that he is qualified for a particular job. They had the opportunity to gain the experience necessary for it and the opportunity to show that they were up to the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
We must not think that simply to have the right to stand up and say something will always result in bouquets, promotions or whatever. When one seeks the opportunity to stand up with the knowledge that one is good enough for the job, one will show it. But if one is not good enough, one will show that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in making these appointments, the Lord Chancellor has available to him in those cases the information which I say is a must when he is choosing judges. There is an additional factor. Solicitors who appear in county courts will usually appear in the same court or courts within a comparatively small area most of the time. They will become known to the county court judges in the same way as those who practice in the High Court become known there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the controlled passions that can be aroused in any discussion between members of the Bar and members of the Law Society, or even between the Solicitor-General and his hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter), but I do not see where the words " county court" appear in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will have observed, Mr. English, that the one thing that I have not done from start to finish is to plead an interest at the Bar. If you will forgive me for saying so, it would be unfortunate if anyone gained the impression—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not taking sides with either half of any profession, or with one of two professions. I am merely pointing out that the debate has taken almost an hour. It is the last debate. I think that most members of the Committee would be glad if it were brought to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose, unless you rule me out of order, Mr. English, to finish putting the case on record, because it has never been put properly on record in a dispassionate way. You have corrected me on the use of the phrase " county court". I am not sure where references should be corrected. It is right, as I said, that solicitors have had the right of audience in the county court for a long time. That has been continued into the circuit courts. That is why solicitors can both gain the experience and show that they are up to thejob.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to where I was, there are two other points with which I want to deal. There is a suggestion that in some way it is a slur on people to have two-tier judges and that there is a lack of promotion. This is a question not of promotion but of whether people have, or do not have, the qualifications and are able to show them. Those who get on to the circuit bench by one route will have done so by a route that has enabled them to gain the experience and show that they have the necessary mettle. Those who have got there by another route will not have been able to do so. It is nobody's fault. It is no slur on anybody, either. It is a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I come to the attitude of the Bar. I shall refer to the Bar just to make this point. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
Bar's attitude is simple. We do not say, and never have said, that among the ranks of solicitors there are not those who, with the right experience and training, would make good High Court judges. We know that there are because we have enormous respect for those who have joined us. Two have been mentioned—Lord Widgery and Lord Donovan. There is also David Napley, and a very senior example is the Vice Chancellor, Mr. Justice Megarry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we say is " Come and join us. Come and do it the same way. Take the chances with us." We have made it easy for people to change over to the Bar. There is not even a minimum period that a solicitor has to do after changing over before he can be appointed to the High Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is " we"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I use " we " in this context: I have been a party to joint working parties of solicitors and barristers which have recommended changes in the rules for transferring from solicitors to barristers. In those committees, we have recommended transfers to make it easier and quicker for solicitors to come to the Bar. Many have taken advantage of it, have shown their mettle and have gone roaring ahead to eminence on the High Court bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall repeat what I have said, in case it was lost sight of. A solicitor wishing to take that course has only to transfer and show his worth. There is no minimum period for which he has to practise at the Bar before the Lord Chancellor can choose him. All that the Bar says is " Come and join us. Gain the qualification. Come and show that you can do it. If you are better than we are, you will be promoted above us "—as many have been. So be it. That is what life is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the reasons—none of which has any connection with the dispute between the Bar and solicitors, or anything approaching an internecine wrangle—why I suggest that the Commitee reject the new clause. If a vote were to be taken on the matter, it would be better to have a vote of the whole House. I invited my hon. Friend to consider withdrawing the new clause for that purpose. However, I understand that he declines that inviation and, for that reason alone, I say that if it is pressed to a vote in Committee, the new clause should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be mindful of your admonition, Mr. English, and be as brief as possible. I support the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter) that the new clause should have been moved by a non-solicitor. My preference would have been the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), who has solar not graced our proceedings. In the Committee on the Legal Aid Bill, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If Committee members are serious about their parliamentary obligations, they should be prepared to meet at the normal time of 10.30 am and, if necessary, 4.30 pm as well."—	<i>[Official Report; Standing Committee D,</i> 21 June 1982, c3.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
should not be the only ones to participate in the debate on this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, must declare an interest as a solicitor and member of the Law Society. But I must also make it clear that my prospects of becoming a High Court judge, even if the new clause is passed, are minimal. There is, as my hon. and learned Friend has said, no hiding place when one stands on one's feet. I am conscious of the fact that ranged against me are four QCs, whereas my hon. Friend and I, humble members of the solicitors' profession, are alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the new clause would oblige the Lord Chancellor to appoint solicitors to the High Court bench. It would merely widen the list from which he may make appointments of appropriate experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said " ranged against me are four QCs." That makes an assumption which is not necessarily accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point in some jest, and I do> not seriously think that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend made remarks about the Benson report. There is no suggestion in the new clause that we should go against the conclusion of that report. This is not an argument for the fusion of the profession. Similar comment was made 10 years ago when it was proposed to appoint recorders from the ranks of solicitors as well as from the Bar. The system has been in operation since 1971, and some of our best and most eminent circuit judges are former practising solicitors. One has already been quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend makes the valid remark that there is no point making appointments to the High Court bench unless those so appointed have the appropriate experience, otherwise, they cannot preside over the deliberations. I entirely agree. But the Lord Chancellor would make such appointments only from those who had already held judicial appointments on the Crown court bench. It is rare, anyway, to appoint as a High Court judge someone who is currently a circuit judge. It is possible; the eligibility will be there, and that is what is sought in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that many solicitors practising in litigation have a vast experience of High Court work. They prepare all cases for counsel, and their knowledge of High Court practice and procedure is often as great if not greater than those who practise regularly on their feet, and many circuit judges act on a regular basis as deputy High Court judges. Therefore, I argue that by experience and qualification there is a case for using solicitors, if they are so eligible. Surely someone who has sat as a circuit judge for five or 10 years, whether recruited from the Bar or from the solicitor side of the legal profession, has an expertise and competence at least as wide as that of many who are appointed to the High Court bench from the Bar, whose experience may be very narrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common knowledge that there is a shortage of able and willing people whom the Lord Chancellor can appoint?to the High Court bench- That: will be even more the case when the new London courts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
are opened. The new clause widens the eligibilty for appointment—that is all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Goodman, who is one of the country's most eminent solicitors and still practises—I know that my hon. and learned Friend will disagree that there is any real argument between the Law Society and the Bar on this matter—is quoted as saying that this is an issue between the Bar and the rest of the civilised world. This is not a matter for solicitors only—it is a matter for the public. If we widen the list from whom suitably qualified people can be drawn to serve, we widen the list in the public interest, too. Surely it is in the public interest that people who are capable of serving should not be excluded. Only a tiny handful would be eligible, and, in the public interest, the new clause should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am persuadable either way on the merits of the case. That is how I started and how I finish after hearing some—I regret not all—of the debate on the new clause. I propose to vote for the new clause, however, for two reasons. First, I agree with the Solicitor-General that this is a decision which should be taken by the whole House. Of course, every decision is at least reviewable by the whole House if the Government want that. If the hon. Gentleman does not intend to withdraw his new clause, the only way by which the decision can be taken by the whole House is for the Committee to accept it. The Solicitor-General has virtually invited the Committee to pass the new clause by saying that, because the only way for the new clause to come up again on the Floor of House, if it is not here withdrawn, is for the Committee to adopt it. A Member may have grave doubts about an amendment or new clause before a Standing Committee, but voting for it at that stage does not commit one to voting for it on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. Actually, I had in mind exactly the opposite, that when an amendment or new clause is withdrawn at the invitation of the Minister it can be dealt with in the House. My experience of practice in the House is that if such a new clause is then tabled on Report, it will certainly be called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My experience is that it is best to ask. The matter will then be considered more fully at the next stage of the Bill's proceedings. I do not blame the Solicitor-General for what he says, because any Minister would take the same line. But that is not the right approach. The Government have to rustle round and see whether they can mount a better case. If something is not in a Bill, hon. Gentlemen then have to try to amend it on the Floor of the House. I am unhappy about the tone of that part of the debate which I have heard. There is evidence of professional interest, which is regrettable. I should like to hear further argument in a different atmosphere. I am not sure that there will be a different atmosphere on the Floor of the House because even more barristers will be present.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
However, I should like to give it a chance and, on those grounds, I shall vote for the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly but not to try to argue the merits of this matter. I, too, declare an interest. I am a member of the Bar. I do not intend to argue the Bar's point of view—if there is such a generalised view, because members of the Bar do not necessarily take a uniform view on this matter any more than solicitors. I can now use a hackneyed phrase with complete sincerity: some of my best friends are solicitors. I am well aware of their intellectual qualities, and it would be impertinent for me to suggest that they were not of the very highest order. Those with whom I have discussed this matter do not feel very strongly about it, but that should not necessarily affect our view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments in this debate are not all on one side, and are not necessarily clear. The matter is complicated. I fully respect the view of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) that those views should be ventilated more fully on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Newark (Mr. Alexander) got his facts wrong, which could give a false impression. He said that it was common knowledge that there was a shortage of people able and willing to undertake the duties of a High Court judge. That casts something of a slur on the High Court bench, and it certainly is not apparent from any recent appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I profoundly regret that this is not a matter which could have been resolved within the legal profession. It is bound to appear as a demarcation dispute, however dispassionate we all try to be. I fully accept that the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter) was totally dispassionate and objective when he moved the new clause. It is hard to resist the attraction of his advocacy, particularly when he made such kind remarks about me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we cannot have the matter resolved within the profession, I agree with those right hon. and hon. Members that it should be resolved on the Floor of the House. The hon. Gentleman moved the new clause with characteristic moderation. He said that it would not make history and was not of earth-shaking importance. I think that it has some importance, and it would be wrong for it to be decided upon at the fag-end of a Committee—a scarcely-attended and diminishing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I draw a different conclusion from that of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury. I take the Solicitor-General's view. The matter rests in the hands of the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port. If he decides that he wishes to press the new clause to a Division, I propose to vote against it on procedural grounds. However, I undertake that there has been no Opposition Whip on this matter. Every hon. Member should be free to exercise his own judgment. If my advice is taken and the matter reappears on the Floor of the House, there will be no Opposition Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman consider that the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter)

is entitled not only to have a final decision on the matter on the Floor of the House, which I agree could be either way, but, having put his case in Committee, to know what the Committee think about it? If the right hon. and learned Gentleman thinks that the matter should be considered on the Floor of the House, will he abstain on the matter rather than vote against it for that reason?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter has exercised my mind substantially, and my decision was not easily made. However, a decision by the Committee at this late hour and with this attendance would be unrepresentative, and so it would be wrong in principle to take one. It is up to the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port to decide whether to put the matter to the Committee. However, it is right that he should know that he would not do so with my approval. I fully understand the arguments that have been ventilated, and shall not delay the Committee further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clear up one matter immediately, as I have the greatest possible admiration and respect for my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General. If I used the phrase " an internecine wrangle", I certainly thought that I prefaced it with " apparently " or " appears to be ". If I did not do so, I apologise and insert that now. The right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) made it clear that that was how it might appear to the outside world. I have been trying to say, perhaps unsuccessfully, that it is a matter of genuine disagreement between different people in the profession, whether they be barristers or solicitors. Indeed, I concede immediately to my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General that some solicitors share his view of the matter, just as some barristers share mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am obliged to the right hon and learned Member for Warley, West and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) for their advice on procedural matters, which has exercised my mind. It would not be right at this hour to deal with all the matters that have been raised. It may be that the House will in the end have to decide. I have considered the matter, taken advice in the committee and outside, and am inclined to take the view of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
