AMENDMENT OF STREET OFFENCES ACT 1959— PUNISHMENT FOR SOLICITING</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"In section 1(2) of the Street Offences Act 1959, the words ' or imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months or both' shall be omitted.".—[<i>Mr Kilroy-Silk.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are also discussing new clause 36— <i>Sexual offences.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned at 1 pm I had just begun by suggesting that the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Pitt) was perhaps being a little parochial, or proud, of his constituency when he said that Croydon did not have any kerb-crawlers. I had a word with the hon. Gentleman after the adjournment and he told me that he meant in the main streets. Presumably, that is the only place he has inspected, but I am sure that Croydon is no different from anywhere else. I was about to tell the Committee that I—and I am sure this also applies to other women both inside the House and outside—have been kerb-crawled myself, if I may use that expression. I live on Hammersmith Road and although I normally travel to and from the House and from my constituency by car, there are occasions when I use public transport. The walk from Hammersmih Broadway underground to my home is about six or seven minutes along a very well-lit, rather wide street. On almost every occasion when I have walked home from the underground late at night there have been one or two kerb-crawlers who have crept along and I have studiously walked forward without looking either to right or left, refusing to run and hoping that nothing more unpleasant than that would happen.<br><br>
On one occasion some time ago, I was feeling particularly stroppy after a day in the House of Commons. Perhaps I was feeling stroppy with the Government, but anyway I was in a fairly bad temper as I was walking home and along came a kerb-crawler. He leant across and opened the door. I could see him out of the corner of my eye as I was walking along and I thought, " I've had enough of this ". I went across and opened the door and I said, "Yes?", and he said, "Are you working?".
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
I said, 'Did you want something?" and he said, "Well, er, yes." I said, "I thought you perhaps might have lost your way and I might have been able to help you as I am a police officer ".<br><br>
I hope that that does not mean that I shall be prosecuted for impersonating a police officer, but the effect was electric, because he practically took my arm off with the speed at which his car shot off down Hammersmith Road. Since then, I have—probably incorrectly and illegally—frequently advised my friends to use the same tactic. So the Metropolitan Police has gained some unwitting recruits in an unofficial capacity. However, this is a serious matter and very many women who have been subjected to this kind of harassment on one or more occasions find it very unpleasant indeed.<br><br>
I was talking recently to a friend who lives in Sheffield. She is married with a husband and two teenage children. Her daughter is 14 and her son is 16 or 17. They have a house in what she refers to as the " red light" district of Sheffield. She says that the prostitutes in that area do not in any way harass the male residents. They know who they are; they do not approach them; they do not solicit them in any way and the male residents are not in any sense subjected to any nuisance. But the female residents of that particular district are harassed by kerb-crawlers, mainly by business men who kerb-crawl at lunchtime and in the early part of the evening. She was really extremely upset when she was telling me this, because only the day before her 14-year old daughter had been returning from school in her school uniform and had been subjected to this kind of harassment from a very well-heeled looking person in a very plush kind of car. I simply say that harassment can come in most directions.<br><br>
I understand from conversations which I have had —and I am sure the Committee knows—that the organisation called PROS has been in touch with Members on both sides, but basically prostitutes who are soliciting or standing in the street do simply no more than stand in the street. Mainly, I understand, they stand in twos or threes, perhaps having a cigarette or talking to each other and just waiting for someone to come along without the prostitute necessarily approaching that person. I am told they are sometimes picked up by the police for soliciting when no potential client is in sight. I presume that is because the police perhaps on that particular evening are doing a swoop or may be have not arrested enough people to fulfil their quota—if that is what they have to do—but in no way could anyone suggest that the women concerned are committing any kind of nuisance. If they were using threatening or abusive behaviour in any way they could still be picked up under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936 which provides for that.<br><br>
What we have done traditionally over many years since we have had the Street Offences Act 1959 is unfairly and perhaps not sensibly to imprison women who should not be in prison. I do not think that is the right way to deal with the problem. I think one must recognise that many women who become prostitutes are women who have had little education and who are unskilled. Many are single parents.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0428">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
with children, whose only other alternative, as they see it—we may see it in a different way—has been to become a prostitute, because they find it difficult to manage. For example, if one is a single parent with one or two children, living on supplementary and child benefit, one could be faced with two or three fuel bills which are so enormous that they are impossible to pay. I am not saying that women in this situation do so, but I can see that some might be tempted into becoming prostitutes in order to get themselves out of some kind of financial mess.<br><br>
We should be looking towards much better educational and training facilities for women generally, to lift them out of the low-paid, unskilled type of ghetto jobs—I am not talking about prostitutes now —which result in women earning two-thirds of the average male earnings. Positive action is needed so that women do not feet it is necessary to turn to some other way of earning a living. I do not say it would be the answer, but in the long term that might be a way of providing much better working facilities and jobs for women who may otherwise have been attracted into this profesion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady, and would obviously be very sympathetic with some of her views. For the record, will she categorically state that there is no way she would advocate this particular form of profession for any particular woman who found herself in the unfortunate circumstances of which she has talked?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Richardson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I would categorically state that. I certainly do not wish to push people into prostitution. That is a matter for them. I do not think it would be a very pleasant profession, anyway. It is certainly not something which would attract me in any way. I would not want it to attract other people. That is why I say that if we provide the right education and skills for people, they might not be attracted into a profession which a lot of people regard with moral indignation or as something which should not be carried on.<br><br>
When we are talking about not advocating prostitution, I would also say that if men did not respond to prostitution there would be no prostitutes. I should like to hear of the occasional case of a man who was seen to be responding to so-called soliciting, being picked up as an accessory after the fact—I presume that one could do that— and an example made of him. As was said this morning, one cannot get anyone else to come forward in court, but if the police officers who actually saw a man responding and saying " Yes, I am coming along", picked him up as well, that might be a bit of a lesson for men responding to the women's advances.<br><br>
We have perhaps as many women as men losing their jobs today. Those figures do not show up in the Government statistics because most of those women are in part-time jobs and do not have enough National Insurance contributions to show up in the statistics. With that kind of loss of job and with the difficulties which have been created
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
for many women by cuts in social services, which have forced them' back into the home to provide services for family or relatives or whatever, which previously the State or the local authority provided, I am not saying it would be an attraction for the overwhelming majority of women to turn to prostitution, but the social conditions which we lay down in our society must have some effect on whether women turn to prostitution as a way of life. I hope that we shall move forward in the future to a society where women are treated on an equal basis and are given opportunities on an equal basis. That might mean that prostitution would disappear.<br><br>
The kind of prostitutes that we are talking about in terms of the two new clauses are not the rich prostitutes that one hears about who work from hotels, as I understand it, or who have luxurious flats. We are talking about the people who charge very much less and who cannot easily afford the fines. Many more of them are in jail for non-payment of fines—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—than for the actual offence of soliciting. During discussions I had with the women who came to talk about this issue with us recently, one said that she had been in jail for six months for nonpayment of fines and she was doubly affronted because she said she was on holiday at the time she was picked up and was in no sense soliciting; she just happened to be walking down the street where she perhaps was known.<br><br>
I can understand in many respects why Governments have been afraid to change the law because they believe that this would produce an outcry of moral indignation from the general public, but I think that there has been a change in the climate of opinion over the past few years and there is much more understanding about the ineffectualness of committing women to prison for an offence of soliciting, particularly as prostitution is not an offence. I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to this and will perhaps give us some encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that prostitution itself is not an offence, but soliciting is. If we recommend any change in the legislation, any change that we might recommend would clearly apply, as she put it, to the rich prostitutes as well as the poor. Surely any changes must be broadly across the whole category. She has given the impression that any sympathy we may have tends to be at the lower end of the level rather than the higher. The soliciting offence is committed by all classes of prostitutes. We do not want to see a change in that regard.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Richardson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands. Of course, the offence of soliciting applies from top to bottom of the income scale, but the fact is that the soliciting takes place only in the street. The better-off prostitute works from a flat or hotel where she is known and where there is no possibility of her being picked up by the police. Of course, it should apply across the board, but the offence of soliciting is discriminatory because it tends to attract

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
those who are less well off and feel they have to work from the street rather than some other point.<br><br>
I am flattered by the hon. Gentleman's concern for my image in wanting me to make my position clear, presumably so that I do not get a bad name for trying to promote prostitution. I can assure him that I am not trying to do so. I am simply trying to help in getting rid of an archaic way of dealing with this offence. I hope that the Minister will accept new clauses 3 and 36 and that we shall have struck a little blow for progress in this area, in which many charitable agencies such as NAPRO and NACRO have long campaigned. I hope that the Committee will support this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next hon. Member, I remind the Committee that the reason why this new clause has been selected is that it deals with offences and punishments. It would not be in order for the debate to widen out into a general debate about the problems and the reasons for prostitution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been a pleasure to follow the hon. Lady. I agree with much of what she has said, but I should like to make it clear—in a way which, perhaps inadvertently, she did not—that prostitution is a terrible thing for a girl or woman to consider. No amount of hardship, no Government cuts or financial problems of any kind, should ever be a justification for considering it.<br><br>
I should also like to correct the hon. Lady on one point. She suggested that the majority of women in prison for prostitution-related offences were there for non-payment of fines. A number are in prison for non-payment of fines but they are not the majority; they are a minority.<br><br>
I should like to deal with a couple of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor). I agree with much of what he said, but he gave the impression that he thought that fines might be increased not because the existing fines are sufficient for the sort of street prostitute who is likely to be prosecuted under this law, but because it would be a way of getting at the pimps and madams who organise these women and for whom fines of £50 or £200 might be no deterrent.<br><br>
This kind of street prostitution is not, so far as I know, usually organised by pimps, madams or syndicates. Quie often, such a girl may be kept by her boy friend who may, to that extent, be living off immoral earnings, but the properly organised brothels and rackets tend to involve the kid of prostitute who is higher up in the market than the girls who are dealt with under this law. The returns which they can expect are quite modest and to such people £50 or £200 would be a serious imposition.<br><br>
Last year, reports of an establishment in Streat-ham, not far from Croydon, North West, appeared in the newspapers. A lady was organising the house and with luncheon vouchers one could get a three-course meal and wine, and the company of a woman afterwards. I remember being in the Tea Room with a colleague of mine who was reading the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
<i>Evening Standard.</i> I shall not say who he was but he was reading that someone had said: "A three-course meal, wine and a woman, all for £25. The wine can't be up to much." That is the sort of level at which these women operate, and for them £50 or £200 would be a very serious fine.<br><br>
I think it is wrong in principle to try to attack pimps or madams through imposing fines which one knows the girls will not be able to pay but which one hopes will be passed on to the organisation. I do not think that is the right way of imposing fines under our system of criminal law.<br><br>
I think that fines are the right form of punishment and, as you said, Mr. Dean, it is punishment that we are talking about. Nobody is suggesting that soliciting for the purposes of prostitution should not be prosecuted; only that imprisonment should not be the punishment. I know that some of my hon. Friends, particularly the hon. Members for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) and The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley), are most interested in alternatives and have been suggesting birching as an alernative to fines, but I must inform them that one has to pay extra for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that the proposals put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) and myself in no way had anything to do with this particular case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only joking, as I am sure my hon. Friend understands.<br><br>
New clause 36 is intended to be precisely the same in effect as the amendment tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk). Its effect should be to remove imprisonment as a possible sentence at or after the third conviction for soliciting for the purposes of prostitution. Perhaps it would be helpful if I pointed out —because this is a subject about which people tend to get rather excited—what the amendment does not do. It does not decriminalise prostitution. Prostitution itself is already lawful. It does not decriminalise soliciting, for which an impressive range of fines—up to £200 for the second offence—remains available. It does not concern the problem of nuisance to neighbouring premises caused by the prostitute's use of her own premises. That is a pressing problem but the offence here—and it is hard to establish an offence—would not be that of soliciting.<br><br>
There is nothing in the amendment concerning call girls, escort agencies, magazine advertisements or cards in windows. All those activities can be carried on, if carried on carefully, within the law. If they break the law, soliciting is most unlikely to be the charge. The power to imprison for non-payment of fines is not removed. That, in my opinion, despite the previous debate, must always remain available to the courts as the ultimate sanction.<br><br>
My amendment concerns what might be loosely termed as the bottom end of the market. Although ' my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West is correct in saying that there may be soliciting by all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0430">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
types of prostitute, and that the expensive type of prostitute may also solicit, the fact is that street soliciting is far more common at the bottom end of the market than it is at the top. If the champagne cocktail consort is the Rolls-Royce of the trade, we are talking in the amendment about the 1957 Morris Oxfords of the trade.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ormskirk dealt impressively —as I expected he would—with all the facts and statistics behind this problem and with the evidence cited by many of the expert bodies involved. I do not wish to repeat what he has said, so that leaves me free to go into the matter of the jurisprudence of the particular change proposed. I would remind the Committee—although it will need no reminding —that General Smuts and I both got the George Long prize for jurisprudence at university, so it is unlikely that I should be wrong in my comments. There are, I suggest, three proper elements in criminal punishment—retribution, deterrence and reform. Under retribution I include the argument that my hon. and learned Friend often uses and with which I heartily agree—that it is necessary for the administration of justice to retain the confidence of the community. Consequent upon that argument, we should admit that, although one of the elements was practical—to eliminate what is, practically speaking, a street nuisance—another element was to suppress behaviour which was thought to be sinful.<br><br>
I do not entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ormskirk when he says that there really is not much of a moral content to the crime, and that the intention is simply to remove a street nuisance. If it were collecting boxes for the blind that these women were shaking under our noses in the street, I imagine we should tolerate a good degree more nuisance from that form of soliciting than we would from the form of soliciting which is under discussion here. My hon. and learned Friend and I may not think this form of behaviour particularly sinful, but the fact is that the element of moral wrong was in the minds of the legislators and is still to some extent in the minds of the public.<br><br>
It is very clear in the public mind—many hon. Members have made this point—that the sin, if sin it be, attaches equally to the woman and her male customer, yet the law in practice cannot often catch and punish the man. It should try to do so more often than it does, but it would, practically speaking, be rather difficult to do so.<br><br>
That being so, and the apparent inequity being very marked in the mind of the public, it is right that we should at least mitigate that inequity by removing the most personally humiliating of the punishments available.<br><br>
Perhaps, from the sorts of lives we lead and the sorts of constituency occasions we tend to be involved in, we sometimes overestimate the gentility of the general public. In my opinion, the general public is a good deal more robust about how offenders of whom they strongly disapprove should be treated by the criminal law than we would like, and a good deal more tolerant about how offenders of whom they do not strongly disapprove should be treated by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
the criminal law. It is easy for us to over-estimate the gentility of the public and to over-estimate the sort of reaction that changes like this may evoke.<br><br>
I move on to the deterrent function of punishment. In my opinion, the strongest argument for hesitating before we remove the penalty of imprisonment is that this is a useful last resort for the most serious of offenders. It is worth mentioning in passing that the argument of last resort could be used for all those minor offences whose serious aspect arises not from the gravity of the individual offence but from the cumulative nuisance value of constant repetition. That would go, for instance, for parking offences, but we do not generally include imprisonment as the ultimate sanction for offences of that kind, simply because there would be a distasteful and apparent disproportion between the crime and the punishment. We would tend to lose the public sympathy, which is so important, if we did that.<br><br>
A more practical argument, perhaps, for this last resort reason for having the punishment of imprisonment would be that the court could, consistently across the country—only when the offence was a serious and very repeated one—use imprisonment in that way, but there is no consistency across the country. If the courts used punishment consistently, that argument would stand up; it is an attractive theoretical argument. Our own experience, however, is that some courts are very inclined, even with comparatively trivial offences, to send prostitutes to prison, while other courts will almost never do so.<br><br>
In Merseyside, for instance, 005 of a woman, if that has any significance—it is certainly as much as I can handle—out of every 100,000 is at present in prison because of prostitution. In the West Midlands, five women out of every 100,000 are at present in prison for prostitution. These figures may indicate a preponderance of virtue in the Merseyside in a ratio of 100 to 1, as opposed to the West Midlands, but what I think they indicate is that in the Merseyside magistrates do not send prostitutes to prison, whereas in the West Midlands they are very inclined to do so. The last resort argument, if not applied consistently across the country, loses a good deal of its force.<br><br>
Does imprisonment significantly deter beyond what the system of fines already achieves? We should be honest about this and admit that the evidence is only anecdotal. The evidence is that imprisonment does not add much to the deterrent value of sentences. The evidence is that the typical street prostitute is an unskilled, poorly educated, single parent who has drifted into prostitution for mainly financial reasons. Usually she has not been convicted for the first time without police evidence that she has already become what is termed a common prostitute, and despite that first conviction and first fine of up to £50, she has offended again and faced a second fine of up to £200. I asked the Committee whether it is intuitively likely that such women will stop now. The law on soliciting serves not to eliminate soliciting, but to control its display, namely, to force prostitutes, through fear of punishment, to keep a low profile and to be as discreet as possible in the way that they solicit.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0431">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
5 pm<br><br>
I suggest that a series—if necessary an unending series—of fines up to £200 will do as much in that direction as it is practically possible to do. I point out, too, that if a woman is soliciting in so brazen and disorderly a way as to cause public disorder of any kind, section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936, for which imprisonment may be awarded as the punishment, is adequate to deal with that.<br><br>
I shall not go into detail on the matter of reform, because I thought that it was dealt with effectively by the hon. Member for Ormskirk. I simply say, as the hon. Gentleman said at greater length and on more evidence than I have, that there is no proper evidence that on any scale prison acts as a reforming agent. The Home Office working party on vagrancy and street offences in 1974 specifically stated that prison did not rehabilitate street prostitutes. Talking about the effect of this punishment, 1 would suggest that the Government seem to have accepted that imprisonment is not necessary as a penalty for soliciting in Scotland.<br><br>
The existing statute law in Scotland is contained in the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892, section 12 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 1976, and in certain local Acts. All these provide for fines but the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act also provides for a maximium imprisonment of 30 days if there are previous convictions. All these Acts will be repealed by the Civic Government (Scotland) Bill which is now going through Parliament and, as I understand it, there is no provision in that Bill for imprisonment for prostitution. I do not suggest that Scotland is in every way comparable to England, but I should have thought that if those measures were sufficient to deal with the problems of soliciting in, for instance, Dundee or Glasgow, they would be sufficient to deal with the problems of soliciting in England.<br><br>
Perhaps I have made too heavy weather of what from a practical point of view might have been better broached as a small, unsensational and sensible step affecting few people, and allowing the law to catch up with the lead that most magistrates are already giving on the subject. For the 300 or so women now in prison, and for others who may be in future, this is a serious matter. It is the most serious matter imaginable. If my hon. and learned Friend feels able to respond sympathetically to the amendment it will not, I suggest, be a moment too soon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a good deal of hypocrisy about the subject. We have heard something about the morality of women selling their bodies to me, but the truth is that it has never been illegal to do so. Indeed, the Burke's Peerage group of companies has now brought out a book which extols the virtues of mistresses down the ages of established and celebrated families, who no doubt in their time voted Conservative.<br><br>
That kind of dubiety has animated every discussion throughout the ages concerning what should be done about prostitution. If we really thought that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
it was so immoral that it ought to be criminal, we should have passed legislation a long time ago to make it illegal for a prostitute to practise her trade in any circumstances, and we do not. The issue has always been not whether we wanted to get rid of prostitution—because if we did we would also prosecute the men—but whether we ought to enable it to continue in such a way that it was not offensive to people who might be offended by the contact with a prostitute or by the fear that that was on our streets. That is the area that we must continue to protect.<br><br>
May I say to the hon. Member for Belper (Mrs. Faith) that I remember the situation before 1956, and I wholly supported the Wolfenden attempt to establish the difference between soliciting in the street and prostitution in circumstances that were not offensive to other people. I think that the Wolfenden experiment succeeded in that sense. What we must argue about is why it succeeded. It is true that it was not an offence punishable by imprisonment until the Wolfenden reports were implemented. Up to that stage a fine was the only punishment. My judgment of what happened in those years is that it was not the fact that a prostitute could be sent to prison which cleared the streets; it was the fact that there was a change in public mood and also that, inasmuch as prostitution was still a problem on the streets, one had a wider range of penalties, not merely imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Sheila Faith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belper)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if it did not generally speaking reduce the numbers, it did reduce the number of prostitutes on the street to some extent—the fact of imprisonment was a deterrent—and that people would not welcome any increase in the number of prostitutes on the street?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to develop the two reasons why I did not think that that was the judgment. The fact that imprisonment was available under the Sexual Offences Act was not, in my view, the crucial factor. Before the Sexual Offences Act became law, the maximum penalty was 40 shillings, which was no deterrent because, as Wolfenden argued in his report, it was possible for a prostitute to add that to the fee and to guard against the provision of a fine in that way. Now it is possible for the prostitute to be fined up to £200 and, as the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) said, that might be a very severe punishment to many street prostitutes. There is always the possibility that if one did not pay—unless the provisions in the law were changed—one might go to prison in that way. So in the sense of the penalty there is a disincentive to street prostitution anyway.<br><br>
Much more important, in my judgment, than the penalty has been the change in public mood. The difficulty about being old in this Committee is that I can remember the mores before Wolfenden, and the whole permissive society concept opened up a completely different moral attitude. If one wanted to associate with a woman in the period before 1956, the street might be the only place to find the woman. That cannot be said to be true today. Perhaps that is better, perhaps it is worse, but it is not true. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0432">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
those circumstances, the demand for the services of a prostitute in that sort of way is very different. The clientele demand something rather different. Even if we were to go back to the 40 shillings—which, as I said, we would not do—we should not be talking about the same kind of situation. I do not believe that removing imprisonment would lead to the kind of situation that obtained in our streets before 1956. If it were simply a question of the balance of judgment and one punishment as against another the hon. Lady might fairly say to me that we ought not to take the risk. But there is a whole lot extra and the case has been put so many times that I do not need to put it again.<br><br>
The case against imprisonment of prostitutes is very strong indeed. It does not do them any good. It does not do the prison system in which they are operating any good. It is an additional drain upon our resources in the prison system, and, for all these many reasons, I think that that heavily weights the case against continuing imprisonment. Taken with what I have already indicated about the change in the attitude of society to this kind of relationship, I do not think it is likely to create the kind of situation we had before 1956.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Faith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman agree that the change in attitudes in society which has occurred since the early 1960s was partly due to the fact that prostitutes no longer appeared on the streets and that young women could be more free and easy in their manner without being thought to be prostitutes, and could dress more colourfully and more attractively than perhaps they had done in the 1950s?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I just do not accept that at all; that is a hyperbole of imagination. The truth of the matter is that people now are much freer in their relationships and do not need the services of prostitutes in the same sort of way, and those who do need the services of prostitution know how to obtain it without necessarily having to go on the streets. The fact that there is still a small residue of women on the streets, even when there is the sanction of imprisonment, suggests that there will always be some irreducible minimum that we shall not be able to get off the streets. Therefore, that does not argue for maintaining the punishment of imprisonment.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Lady is putting the case with the greatest integrity and is reflecting the view of a good many magistrates on the subject, but there are also a good many magistrates who take a different view. It is worth taking the risk and recognising that, although imprisonment may have been justified in 1956, at this stage it is no longer justifiable and we should get rid of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. A. Trippier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rossendale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution in this interesting debate, albeit very briefly. If one believed that imprisonment for prostitutes charged with soliciting was a deterrent, one would vote against the amendments which we are discussing—as, clearly,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mrs. Faith) is going to do. But, having listened very carefully to the arguments which she articulated as a magistrate and calling on her experience as a magistrate, I have to say to her regretfully that I, too, as a magistrate fail to be convinced of those arguments.<br><br>
I fail to be convinced that imprisonment is a deterrent in these cases. It is interesting to discover, when one does research into this subject, that 10 per cent, of the female prison population are convicted of charges related to prostitution. In 1980, apparently, 308 female prostitutes were remanded and convicted, so the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) was absolutely right in his contention that, even if we were fortunate in securing support for the amendments before the Committee this afternoon, it would not make a significant reduction in the prison population. But I wonder whether that is really the point. The most important point is whether it is right to change the legislation.<br><br>
I certainly would?, not regard prostitution as a crime in the widest sense and, clearly, the law does not. Prostitution is legal, as has already been said by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), but soliciting is not.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris), in his excellent contribution, said the Home Office working party on Vagrancy and Street Offences admitted that prison could not rehabilitate street prostitutes, but what he failed to say was that it also said that it would be foolish to believe that imprisonment turns women away from soliciting.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
If it is accepted that imprisonment is not a deterrent, I cannot believe that society as a whole would say that these women should be removed from that society for a period because they are a danger to it. That argument has been put on several occasions when we have been considering other clauses of the Bill before the Committee. I do not think that it applies; in fact, the idea is preposterous. If it is accepted by some members of the Committee that imprisonment is not a deterrent to prostitutes, it can be accepted that it can cause unacceptable hardship for families, as most street prostitutes are mothers, and imprisonment frequently means the reception of children into care. It can cause great distress to the woman and her children.<br><br>
It is calculated that the cost of putting a woman into prison is now £215 a week for a women's closed prison or £127 for a women's open prison. In addition, there is the cost of keeping children in care. In 1978–79 the cost was £107 to keep a child in a community home, and the same cost would be incurred for keeping a child in a residential nursery. So the total current cost of imprisoning the prostitute with two children—one below and one above school age—would be approximately £300 a week, assuming that the children are taken into care. One must be very sure of the advantage of sending them to prison when one considers the cost. For those reasons I am anxious to support the new clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of the arguments have already been clearly stated by Members on both sides of the Committee, so I will not take up the time of the Committee by going over them again.<br><br>
It seems to me that, when we consider the appropriateness of imprisonment as a punishment, we might apply three criteria in coming to a judgment. The first is whether imprisonment deters to a greater extent than other offences. The second is whether the offence is so grave that it deserves imprisonment. The third is whether in some ways society is protected by imprisoning the people concerned. I submit that the answer to all three questions in the case of soliciting by prostitutes is " No". I would argue that imprisonment does not deter. I would argue that the offence of soliciting is not grave enough to merit imprisonment, and I would argue that society is in no way protected from anything outrageous by imprisoning women who are found guilty of soliciting.<br><br>
The difficulty is that the law in this whole area is a bit of a mess. It is a bit of a mess because, on the one hand, as other hon. Members have said, prostitution is legal under the laws of the land and yet a number of activities inevitably associated with prostitution are illegal. It is inevitable for certain prostitutes, at any rate. Those at the top end of the financial scale, who may arrange everything by telephone, are not likely to run foul of the law at all. But there is another area of confusion which underlies our wish in some way—not our wish on this Committee I trust but the wish of some people in this country— to punish women for soliciting. That is the confusion between using the law as an expression of morality and using the law as a way of penalising a social nuisance. I submit that neither is appropriate in the case of this particular offence. Traditionally in this country we have tended to view many matters of morality in the sense that if they are not visible they are all right, whether it is prostitutes or obscene publications.<br><br>
Perhaps the more pressing argument is the one of nuisance. What this debate has shown, as other discussion of the issue has done, is that the law is inadequate in coming to grips with people who cause nuisance. As my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) rightly pointed out, many of the activities associated with kerb crawling —activities by men rather than by women—are the cause of most of the complaints in our constituencies. However, they are addressed to us as complaints about prostitution, when in fact they are complaints about noise late at night, car doors slamming and women, who are not prostitutes, being accosted on the streets and, quite rightly, taking offence.<br><br>
I think that we should address ourselves—I understand that it cannot be in this Committee, because it is not appropriate to the Bill—to a new concept of nuisance. We should protect society in the way that many of our constituents wish to be protected—not from soliciting, but from noise nuisance, which is mainly caused by men. It is in this area that the law needs tidying up in the wider sense.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
As regards the specific point at issue, I suggest that there is no case for putting women into prison for soliciting. Hon. Members have argued why it is wrong. It does not deter or in any way protect society. It is discriminatory, because it lets the men off scot-free while punishing the women. It is a harsh offence. I suggest that it would be right for the Committee to reject imprisonment for soliciting by prostitution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford. North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I moved an amendment to clause 26 a week ago, I said that I would support these new clauses todayfor very different and sound reasons.<br><br>
First, we have to make it quite clear that what we are discussing is not making soliciting legal, but doing away with imprisonment for soliciting. That is the key issue that we must all get into our minds.<br><br>
Before the Wolfenden report, the low fine of 40 shillings encouraged soliciting on the streets of our large cities. But the fines that the court has the ability to inflict today, starting at £50 and going up to £200, create a very different situation. I believe that a fine of £200 is in itself a deterrent and that the extra sentence of imprisonment does not act as a great deterrent.<br><br>
If soliciting were to increase, we could consider the amount of fines at a later date. I believe that the time has come to go for the open ground and to try to move sensibly towards doing away with imprisonment for this offence.<br><br>
I believe, as I said in connection with clause 26, that imprisonment is needed for crimes of extreme violence. If we are to make serious crimes punishable by imprisonment, surely we must compare the difference in gravity of offences. We cannot compare soliciting with mugging. Soliciting may be offensive to the person, but it is not like being attacked, mugged or raped. There is a very big difference.<br><br>
Again, there is a difference between soliciting and harassment. In the days when the fine was very small, when walking down a street one would be approached by the same prostitute not once, but several times, which gave the impression of harassment. With the heavier fines imposed today, if a prostitute approached a man and he said " No ", I do not think that prostitute would want to approach him again. Therefore, there are areas where we can start to look at things more sensibly and in a slightly different light than perhaps we have done in the past.<br><br>
Many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have talked about the problems of nuisance to constituents living in flats and close-knit communities. I do not want to dwell too much on this issue, because I may be straying out of order, but one of the greatest single problems that I have discovered—and I have never had anyone complain to me about soliciting—has been the harassment and nuisance caused to people, often in blocks of flats, by others who are entertaining friends. The nuisance is caused by doors banging, sometimes fights breaking out, and so on. That will become far more of a problem than the problem we are discussing this afternoon. It is a problem that we shall have to face as time goes on. I have had many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0434">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 537</span>
complaints. They have become more numerous over the last two or three years and are continuing to gather momentum.<br><br>
I was a little disheartened to learn that the hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) was concerned about cabbie crawlers. I think she mentioned something about cabbie crawlers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Richardson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Kerb crawlers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I thought the hon. Lady was referring to some of my LTDA friends in the taxi trade. Therefore, I was becoming a little concerned. I thought they must perhaps be members not of the LTDA but of the TGWU. However, as I misunderstood, I apologise.<br><br>
Kerb crawling is a worrying problem. It concerns many people. However, there is another aspect that concerns me. This is no secret. It has happened to my wife and I believe it may have happened to the wives of many hon. Members. If an hon. Member's wife, on her way to the House, stands in a taxi queue at Victoria station, in the 10 minutes she is waiting for a taxi she can be approached numerous times by men. If members of the Committee do not believe me, I challenge them to let their wives stand in a taxi queue at Victoria.<br><br>
Let us be quite frank about it. Men soliciting is every bit as bad as ladies soliciting, but it is a common occurrence on our streets today. If we are to look at this matter rationally, practically and sensibly, then soliciting must be an offence for a man just as it is for a woman.<br><br>
Therefore, having expressed those views, I support members on both sides of the Committee. I believe we should run for the open ground. We should provide an opportunity now to do away with imprisonment for prostitution. I do not believe that it will cause great problems in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a welcome degree of unanimity in the Committee on this new clause, with the notable exception of the hon. Member for Belper (Mrs. Faith). It has been said several times that to release from prison those who are there for soliciting and loitering offences would not significantly reduce the total prison population. That is true, so vast is the total prison population. But it would significantly reduce the total female prison population.<br><br>
Overcrowding in women's prisons is now more of a problem than it was a few years ago. There has been an increase in crimes of violence among women, which we did not have five or 10 years ago, and the women's prisons are now suffering from overcrowding in a way that they did not at that time. Approximately 10 per cent, of female prisoners are convicted on charges related to prostitution. This is a high proportion of the total female prison population. If they are taken out, many prisons will be less crowded than they are at the moment. In addition there will be a saving in money, since it costs £1,000 to keep a woman in prison for three months.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
5.30 pm<br><br>
The Home Secretary is frequently quoted in these debates as saying that imprisonment is justifiable only in cases where the behaviour of offenders constitutes a significant threat to society. I say that these women do not fall into that category. It has also been said that prison offers no deterrent. Those who are sent to prison are already guilty of a third offence—otherwise, they would not be sent to prison—and there has been no sign of deterrence up to that point.<br><br>
The Home Office working party on vagrancy and street offences admitted that prison could not rehabilitate prostitutes. The Prison Governors' Association agrees with this, and so do the prostitutes themselves. One wonders what would be a deterrent to prostitutes. They have said that they regard themselves as doing a job of work. I think that is overstating the case. They regard it as the only way in which they want to make money. Therefore, prison is not a deterrent. There is a constant demand for their services outside prison. They say that they resent fines—this is in the report of a programme to reform the law on soliciting, which had interviews with prostitutes—but that they regard them as an inevitable part of the job.<br><br>
If we eliminate prison and low fines, we can only conclude a considerably high fine—it is difficult to decide what the figure should be—will possibly deter them. It is doubtful whether even a high fine could deter these activities. However, that is not what we are considering. We are all agreed that prison is not a deterrent and that it would be extremely valuable to pass the new clause. I am glad that there is so much agreement on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because the arguments in favour of accepting the new clause have been most impressively put forward by both Government and Opposition Members. I found the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) and Rossendale (Mr. Trippier) most compelling.<br><br>
The object of the Bill is to provide a clear framework for criminal justice for future years. The Bill, quite rightly, does some tough things. It is important to distinguish between offences that are utterly unacceptable to society—for which people can expect to be sent to prison promptly for an appropriate term—and offences for which other penalties are appropriate.<br><br>
We are talking about a criminal offence which, by definition, has to take place on the streets. The kind of offences of which we are only too well aware on the streets, and which are wholly unacceptable, are violence, robbery and muggings— which are desperately on the increase—and the prisons are the places to which those convicted of such offences should be sent.<br><br>
Soliciting is a nuisance. Prostitution is deplorable. But sending prostitutes—who, by definition, are frequent offenders—to prison is not a real deterrent. We know that the chances of their being rehabilitated are nil. Fines of up to £200, in so far as any penalty is appropriate, are the appropriate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0435">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 539</span>
penalty. I believe that the risk of being fined frequently for street offences is the most effective deterrent, if deterrent there can be.<br><br>
The cost of keeping a woman in prison is formidable—£127 a week in an open prison; £215 in a closed prison; and over £300 if children are involved. We should bear in mind the effect on the children, because, sadly but truly, many prostitutes are also mothers.<br><br>
The Bill, which rightly strengthens the law and penalties for wholly unacceptable offences such as mugging, should draw a clear distinction. There should be proper penalties for soliciting on the streets, but I believe that a stiff fine is in almost all cases a proper penalty. If it is not paid, the prostitute can still be sent to prison. That is the way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been remarkable for its virtual unanimity—although I must pay attention shortly to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mrs. Faith)—and for the interest that has been shown in the subject that we have discussed.<br><br>
We can all agree that there is a world of difference in the intent that lay behind Parliament's making imprisonment available to the courts for third and subsequent convictions for soliciting and for offences of violence to which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ffemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) has referred. A world of difference lay behind Parliament's motives in those instances. The debate turns in large measure upon whether imprisonment for repeated soliciting constitutes any form of deterrent or protection.<br><br>
I noted carefully the criteria for sentencing that the hen. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) put forward. I could not disagree with them. One of the justifications advanced for imprisonment for repeated soliciting has been that it protects society from the nuisance represented by prostitutes on the street—a nuisance that was most marked in the years leading up to the appointment of the Wolfen-den committee. At this distance we tend to underestimate, if not forget, the public resentment and annoyance at the degree of open soliciting in the streets in those days.<br><br>
We have been discussing whether imprisonment constitutes a deterrent to the kind of troublesome behaviour that was prevalent before 1959 and whether it is inherently justifiable in today's different circumstances. The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) rightly reminded us of the great changes that have taken place in the last 20 years. The sauna parlours, massage parlours and other premises that are now available for those who carry on the trade of prostitution were not known in those days. Therefore, much greater use had to be made of "the street". That is an important criterion. I look at this issue in the light of those considerations.<br><br>
The impact of the 1959 Act was considerable. The numbers of convictions for soliciting, which reached a peak of over 19,000 in 1958, fell to less than 3,000 in 1960, which was the first full year of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 540</span>
the operation of the Act which gave effect to Wolfen-den's recommendations. The extent to which this drop is attributable to the availability of imprisonment is more difficult to assess because one does not know exactly what motivates women to stop soliciting, but it would be unwise to rule out the introduction of imprisonment as a factor. I should have thought that it was a fairly potent factor. Since 1960 the number of convictions has remained under 4,000 a year, although, taken together with the number of cautions, the total number dealt with by the police in recent years has climbed to about 9,000, at which point it seems to be levelling out.<br><br>
I also think it relevant to bear in mind that imprisonment, ever since its introduction in 1959— and it is not always remembered that we have had imprisonment for this offence only since 1959 for the third or subsequent offences—has remained a penalty of last resort. In practice, the number sentenced to immediate imprisonment has remained at less than 300 a year since the early 1960s.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) asked me how the number of women sent to prison for repeated soliciting compares with those who are there for defaulting on fines. The proportion is roughly a quarter. Those received into prison for failing to pay fines appear to represent about a quarter of those received in any one year. In 1978, 90 receptions of prostitutes out of a total of 300 were fine defaulters as distinct from immediate custodial sentences. In 1979, 60 receptions out of a total of 250 were fine defaulters. So we see that the courts have been using this power sparingly, and evidently as a last resort. I am not in the least surprised.<br><br>
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Belper, who has experience as a magistrate and told the Committee the views of the Magistrates' Association, would concede that, although the Magistrates' Association is opposed to the abolition of imprisonment for prostitution, it has no illusion that imprisonment for prostitutes has no rehabilitative effect and is an incongrous environment and sentence for a prostitute. I think my hon. Friend would agree that the Magistrates' Association based its support for the continuance of this sentence solely on the ground of the protection that it gives to the public for a limited time. I do not believe that the magistrates suppose that any prostitute fails to go back on the street once she is allowed out of prison. My hon. Friend clearly acknowledges that that is an accurate resume of the association's opinion.<br><br>
The numbers of people who would be kept out of prison if the new clause were accepted would be relatively small. None the less, the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) said that it would make a significant contribution to reducing overcrowding in women's prisons. That opinion was probably based upon the number of receptions rather than the numbers in women's prisons at any one time for offences of prostitution. On 30 June 1980, only 33 women were in prison for offences relating to prostitution—about 2½ per cent, of the total number of women in prison on that day, which I understand was a representative day. Therefore,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0436">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 541</span>
I do not believe that one should look upon this proposal as having more than a very slender effect upon prison numbers. Of course, it is right to say that, other things being equal, any reduction in prison numbers that can be achieved is to be welcomed.<br><br>
No one wants to see prostitutes sent to prison if that can be achieved without detrimental consequences to public order or decency or the confidence that the public have in the way in which the penal system is administered.<br><br>
Naturally, we have considered carefully the arguments that have been put forward against the use of imprisonment as a penalty under the 1959 Act. Soliciting in itself is, of course, a relatively trivial offence, in many people's minds scarcely meriting a custodial sentence. Many prostitutes have children. That comment has been made by more than one Member today—in particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall). Arrangements have to be made for them when their mothers go into custody. Often the children are taken into care. My hon. Friend gave the figure of £300 a week as the cost of imprisonment in those circumstances. I accept that as a perfectly feasible situation. That seems to me to be an entirely proper and a persuasive observation.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The Criminal Law Revision Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Lawton, is now engaged in a review of the law relating to sexual offences—including prostitution—and the penalties for such offences. In the review the committee has the assistance of a specially constituted policy advisory committee on sexual offences. Having received submissions from a wide range of bodies, the committee will issue a working paper setting out its provisional views on which it will invite public comment.<br><br>
The committee hopes to be able to publish the working paper within the first half of this year. It was intended, I understand, to contain specific reference to the abolition of imprisonment that we are now discussing. Ideally, the Government would prefer to await the publication of the committee's working paper and its considered assessment of the evidence and argument before reaching any firm conclusions on these matters. The committee has been engaged in a detailed and careful study of the whole of the la wrelating to prostitution. Clearly, we would wish to avoid acting an a way that preempted the conclusion, which is not far off now, of that committee's considerations.<br><br>
We cannot be other than conscious, however, of the strength of opinion that has been expressed today. I am authorised by Lord Justice Lawton—I consulted him last Friday—to say that the policy advisory committee to which I referred, with one dissentient, supports the removal of imprisonment for soliciting. The Criminal Law Revision Committee, by a slender majority—certainly at present— is also in favour. I think that that should be taken into consideration.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 542</span>
We must take into consideration also the numerous questions that have been posed. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will not think it discourteous if I do not review those questions extensively now. Equally, we have to take account of what my hon. Friend the Member for Belper said about the Magistrates' Association. The association says that there are areas in this country in which at present reliance is placed on, and reassurance is found in, the continuance of the power to sentence. My hon. Friend spoke of her experience as a magistrate in Newcastle. I have had the advantage of seeing a letter from the clerk to the magistrates in Newcastle upon Tyne which entirely corroborates what my hon. Friend said today about their experience.<br><br>
Equally I have to take into account what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier), who is a magistrate. He was not persuaded by what my hon. Friend the Member for Belper said. It is possibly putting it a little too high to say, as my hon. Friend the Member for Belper said, that people would never forgive the Committee if there were an increase in the nuisance of prostitution, but I must tell the Committee that it is the view of the Criminal Law Revision Committee that there may be an increase. Indeed, it is plain that there may be. One does not know the degree. One does not know if it is a probability or to what extent it might increase, but I have to concede—and the Committee must remember—that there is a risk of an increase.<br><br>
The matter really turns on what the House ultimately wants to do. Does it want to run a risk without having any idea of the scale of the risk, or will it take the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Belper? In any event, the new clause as it stands is not capable, for technical reasons, of being put into the Bill. It is technically defective. The matter is of sufficient importance that it would be right for the House as a whole to have the opportunity to consider it. I give an undertaking that the Government, having regard to what has been said so forcefully today on both sides, will bring forward a clause that will give effect in proper form to the intent of the new clause. I say that at this stage without commitment, so that the House, on Report, can consider the matter afresh. If that would appeal to the hon. Gentleman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said my hon. Friend's new clause is technically defective. Is new clause 36, in the name of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris), technically defective? If not, we can deal with it on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's new clause is not defective. It is for the Committee to decide whether it wishes the House as a whole to have the opportunity to deal with this matter. I think that it would be wise for the House as a whole to consider the matter, having regard to the misgivings that the Magistrates' Association has expressed. We should not brush them aside. They may not prove to be decisive in the end, but the House as a whole ought to

have the opportunity of expressing its view. It is for my hon. Friends to decide what they want to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said he would bring forward a new clause on Report without commitment. Does that mean that he will not advise the House one way or the other on the new clause? If so, will there be a free vote? What exactly will his attitude be to the new clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady missed three words. I said "without commitment at this stage ". It gave an undertaking to bring forward a clause, properly drafted, on Report. I cannot give an undertaking at this stage as to what the Government's view will be. I think it is right for the House as a whole to have the opportunity to discuss the matter. I cannot go further than to give an unequivocal assurance that I will bring the matter forward in a new clause, as I have indicated.<br><br>
If, on the other hand, my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West, or the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) wish to test the view of the Committee by means of a vote, that is entirely within their discretion and competence. However, I thought it right to explain the Government's view at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. If my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) withdraws his motion, will you allow us to vote on new clause 36 now, or would the vote be postponed until the normal time? It would certainly be for the convenience of the Committee if we could take a decision on one or other of the new clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee wishes to vote on new clause 36, I should be prepared to allow it, but it would have to be when we reach new clause 36, not now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the virtues of having gamekeepers turned poachers on this Committee is that some of us have been through the Minister's direct report and there is always the possibility that the Minister, between now and Report, would find it difficult to accede to what is the overwhelming weight of opinion in the Committee. One of the things that I have found in government is that there is nothing better than a vote to clarify the air when one reaches legislative committee. It is one thing to say there is a lot of feeling, or a weight of opinion, but it is a very different situation, when one is discussing it with one's colleagues, when there has been a vote. Therefore, I say to hon. Members that if they want us to succeed in this let us have a vote now. The only point we can vote on now is my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk's new clause. It is technically defective, but if we were to pass it the Government would have to bring forward a new provision in order to replace it. We could have the discussion then. It makes a world of difference to the argument whether we have had an affirmative vote for it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 544</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very interesting, well informed and one-sided debate. The speeches in favour of the new clause were 10 to one, with only one person from each side speaking against.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister both for the way in which he has responded to the debate and answered the points that have been made and for letting us know the results of the deliberations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee. He need not have done that. It did not particularly arm his case. It added to the strength of those of us on the Committee who want to see the ending of imprisonment for prostitutes and this clause passed tonight but I am grateful to him for having shared that information with the Committee.<br><br>
All of us who have spoken accept that imprisonment neither reforms nor rehabilitates prostitutes. It does not deter them, or if it does it certainly does not deter very many. It does not deal effectively with the problem of public nuisance and street offences. But it does add to the burden in our prisons. It is unfair. It is harsh and an unnecessary treatment of women, and it is discriminatory as between men and women. The general agreement, too, is that the harsh, unnecessary and expensive punishment should be ended. I believe that in future years people will regard it as remarkable that we ever imposed such a draconian sentence on so many women for what is clearly a minor and trivial offence. The Criminal Law Revision Committee apparently takes that same view.<br><br>
I am sorry, Mr. Dean, that we have to come to this point now in the Committee, but I take very forcibly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon). We have tonight to establish the principle. I would prefer that we did it on the new clause of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris), which is apparently not effective, whereas mine is. He has indicated to me that he is not prepared to take a vote, or, rather, that we cannot take a vote now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must have misread the way I shook my head. I think I would be prepared to push my new clause to a division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the first problem. I clearly have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. The problem now is that we cannot vote on his new clause at this point in our proceedings. I take the view that the Committee has clearly established the principle that we can take the vote tonight and then it is for the Government or for any one of us to exercise the proper rights to bring the subject up again on Report and have a further vote to challenge the decision taken here tonight or to put right whatever is apparently allegedly defective within the clause. On those grounds, therefore, Mr. Dean, given that this is the only opportunity that we on this Committee have to make our views clearly known and to put our votes where our mouths should be, I ask hon. Members to vote with me in introducing my new clause into the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parris</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful for the sympathetic and intelligent way in which my hon. and learned Friend has answered the debate. He has been quite as sympathetic as it would be possible for a Minister in his position to be at this stage and, in the light of what he has said, I feel fairly confident that one way or another we are going to get this change into the law. Nevertheless, I see no harm in testing opinion at this stage and I am sure it is within the Goverment's capability to reverse the whole thing on Report, or to give the House the opportunity to do so should it wish to. There is no harm, as I say, in testing opinion at this stage.<br><br>
I must leave it to your judgment, Mr. Dean, at what stage I can press my amendment, but if there is a stage at which I can I shall do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. Could I have a little clarification? If we were to vote on the new clause of the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), what is the position with regard to the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) when we reach that stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said to the Committee that I am prepared to allow a vote on new clause 36, if that is the wish of the Committee, but the time when that comes is in the correct order, not immediately after the vote on this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The position as I understand it is that if we vote on my hon. Friend's amendment, that takes precedence and we vote now. If we choose to vote on the amendment of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) we have to wait for a couple of weeks before we reach it. Is there really no way in which we could decide to vote on the amendment of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West tonight because, surely, it is clearly the view of the Committee that, if we could, we ought to vote on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the feelings of the Committee. There is one way in which it could be done. It is a somewhat complicated procedure, but if the Minister were to move a motion on the order in which we take the clauses—in other words, if he were to move a motion, assuming that new clause 3 were to be withdrawn—if we then took new clause 36 it would be possible for it to be moved formally and to be dealt with before we proceed to the next clause. If the Minister would wish to do that, it would be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I would be meeting the general wishes of the Committee if I were to take the course that has been helpfully suggested.</span></p>

AMENDMENTS TO CRIMINAL LAW ACT 1977— PUNISHMENTS FOR POSSESSION OF CANNABIS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"In paragraph 1(1)(c)(i) of Schedule 5 to the Criminal Law Act 1977, the words ' 3 months or £500, or both' shall be omitted and the words ' £500 where the drug concerned is cannabis or cannabis resin, and 3 months or £500 or both, if the drug concerned is not cannabis or cannabis resin' shall be inserted.".—[<i>Mr. Dubs</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I make it emphatically clear at the outset that the new clause does not seek to legalise the possession of cannabis. What it would do is remove the penalty of imprisonment on summary conviction for the simple possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use. It would not affect the existing penalties for the separate offence of the possession of cannabis with intent to supply other people with the drug. It is merely a measure affecting users of cannabis, and would not affect in any way the pushers of cannabis. It is based upon a recommendation made in a report " Too Many Prisoners " produced by the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group.<br><br>
In 1979, 329 people in the United Kingdom were sentenced to immediate imprisonment for the simple possession of cannabis. I know that over the years the courts have become more liberal and that the proportion of those found guilty of possesion of cannabis receiving custodial sentences has been declining. In <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 1 February 1976 there was an article by a Mr. Peter Watson, who detailed the findings of an unpublished survey by members of the Home Office research unit of the views of magistrates on the relative seriousness of different offences.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 547</span>
According to that survey, magistrates did not regard the smoking of cannabis as a very serious offence. They thought that it was roughly equivalent to creating a disturbance or stealing small amounts. They regarded it as considerably less serious than driving a car while disqualified. That was in 1976, and if anything in the intervening years one would expect that the views of the magistrates would have become more liberal on this issue, but unfortunately views up and down the country are not uniform. If one were to come up in court for the possession of a small amount of cannabis one might be likely to get off more lightly in London than in other parts of the country. The practice of the courts is uneven with regard to the sentences they impose for the possession of this drug.<br><br>
However, the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group was emphatic in its view that one could not justify a custodial sentence for the simple possession of cannabis. That group felt that in a society where most adults drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, it would be wrong to imprison people for the use of a drug which appears from the evidence that we have available to be no more dangerous than tobacco or alcohol, and possibly it might even be less dangerous.<br><br>
There is a counter-argument that the existence of certain socially-approved evils is no reason to create yet another one, and I do not disagree with that proposition. The only purpose of the new clause is to prevent the imprisonment of cannabis users, not their conviction or their being fined for having this drug.<br><br>
A number of bodies and organisations have come out in support of the view that cannabis possession should not be an imprisonable offence. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs had much to say about this in a report which formed part of the council's " Review of the Classification of Controlled Drugs and of Penalties ", published in 1979.<br><br>
Paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15 stated that:
<br><blockquote><p>"there was no compelling evidence that occasional moderate use of cannabis was likely to have detrimental physical effects on individual users . . . The available reports on the effects on the health of the individual of what is deemed to be long continued (a matter of years) heavy use (daily consumption of several ' joints ') of cannabis contain no evidence of consequential harmful effects on physical health and contradictory reports on the mental state and the intellectual capacities of the subjects examined. The sub-committee concluded that a casual relation between chronic use of cannabis and mental impairment was by no means proven."</p></blockquote>
Where the use of cannabis causes the most apprehension is in its effect on impairing the ability to drive a motor vehicle. Sadly, there are no tests to examine motorists on whether they are under the influence of cannabis comparable with those on whether motorists are under the influence of alcohol. So there is a danger that the widespread increase in the use of cannabis and its legalisation would have a damaging effect in that it would be liable to lead to an increase in the number of motor accidents, which I should not wish to happen.<br><br>
However, I do not believe that one can simply say that that would follow from making possession
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 548</span>
no longer an offence attracting a custodial penalty, which is the purpose of the new clause. It is not appropriate to go into all the other arguments about cannabis. I do not believe that cannabis should be totally decriminalised, but there is a reputable body of evidence to suggest that it is not appropriate to have imprisonment as a punishment for the possession of small amounts of cannabis. I therefore hope that the Committee will adopt the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Minister was evidently troubled in the previous debate by the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Belper would not go with other Members of the Committee on that amendment. He need entertain no worries this time that I cannot go with Members of the Committee, because in my support for what the hon. Member for Battersea, South has just said I carry with me no other Members on this side, very few Members of Parliament and probably a minority of the general public.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Battersea, South, is absolutely right. Unfortunately, he is many years ahead of his time. It will be another 20 or 30 years before what he proposes is acceptable to the general public in this country, and I dare say we shall follow behind other countries. It is, therefore, a lost cause. I do not propose to detain the Committee by further argument. We shall just have to wait 20 or 30 years, but the next century will look back at our laws on cannabis and laugh at our prejudices on the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to support my hon. Friend on the new clause. As he pointed out, it was a recommendation of the all-party Penal Affairs Group. It does no more that make possession of cannabis non-imprisonable on summary conviction and does nothing for those convicted on indictment. The view expressed in the new clause was also that of the Advisory Council on Drug Dependence and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.<br><br>
One important point that he did not make is the consequence of imprisonment for some of the young people who are convicted and imprisoned for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use. Many of them one would not describe as criminals in having no propensity to offend. If they are in prison for what they may regard as a perfectly legitimate social activity, the consequences are very serious.<br><br>
Naturally their employment, if any, is disrupted. If they are being educated that too is clearly disrupted. It may disrupt any career accommodation prospects that that may have, and clearly have a profound effect upon their personal and family relationships. In many ways what is much worse than the actual disruption of the normal pattern of their life is the fact that they are for ever after stigmatised as being criminals and ex-prisoners. That, as the evidence—which I do not wish to review now—shows very clearly, is a very serious, unfortunate and unnecessary consequence of imprisoning many of these non-criminal types for this particular offence.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 549</span>
I do not accept the assertion of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South is 20 years ahead of his time. I think that opinion is changing. It has changed quite dramatically in the time that I have been in this House, and indeed in the past 18 months. There is a growing belief among Members on both sides of the Committee that it is absurd to imprison so many young people for this kind of offence. That opinion is also growing outside.<br><br>
There is a greater recognition in the country of the barbarity of reacting to what one might regard as a social problem or a medical or psychological problem; with a dose of imprisonment. It does nothing at all for drug addicts or drug users. We would be much better off in devoting our time, energy and resources to providing therapeutic units and all the care and after care services that may be necessary to stop people using drugs in the first place. I think that a growing body of opinion will make itself felt very forcibly well before the expiration of the 20 years that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West said would be necessary. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will look favourably on this new clause, which reflects the growing body of opinion outside—and it is may own view too—that while the use of drugs should be discouraged as far as possible, imprisonment is an excessively harsh and unnecessary response to the possession of a drug such as cannabis which is being used only for personal use.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not support the new clause and I should like briefly to say why. Though I often agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) and he always puts his case beautifully, I do not agree either with him or the hen. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk)—with whom I often agree as well—that this is a question of being ahead of one's time. I believe that cannabis is actually harmful in its effects on society.<br><br>
There is a good deal of force in the argument that if alcohol were suddenly thrust upon us today we would look at it as askance as we look at cannabis, and I say that as someone who thoroughly enjoys a drink and certainly enjoys a lot of the pleasures of wine and the skills associated with that. I am not in a position to judge whether any such skills are associated with cannabis. But on a serious level, through my work in the courts I have seen the effects on young people of a change in lifestyle which has been quite considerably associated with the smoking of cannabis.<br><br>
There is a profound illogicality in the new clause when hon. Members say that they do not seek to decriminalise cannabis but merely seek to remove the possibility of imprisonment. While the possession of cannabis remains a criminal offence—and I believe for very fundamental reasons that I shall explain briefly that the possession of cannabis should remain a criminal offence—it means that one is committing a criminal act. One is known to be commit-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 550</span>
ting a criminal act and one is vulnerable to the pusher of other drugs and those who lead one into pushing cannabis for gaining money, into LSD and heroin, and into that whole subculture which I believe has done desperate damage to the young people of this country, to families, and now to many middle-aged people. We must be extremely cautious before we take one step down that road.<br><br>
Those who support the new clause said that little harm comes from the possession of minute quantities of cannabis, or perhaps smoking the occasional joint. Insofar as that is proved, it is my experience that the courts take those factors carefully into account when sentencing, and while I could not say that it is unknown for someone to be sent to prison for possessing a minute quantity of cannabis, or simply having been present at a party when it was smoked and had a traceable but minute quantity on him, I should think it extremely rare for that to be the case today.<br><br>
The amendment makes no distinction between the quantities found on a person, and it is my experience that substantial quantities can be found in somebody's possession in circumstances in which it is not possible to establish that he is doing anything except having it for his own use. Although I think that the courts should be, and are, careful, as they are always careful, before they send somebody to prison for any offence, and that they should be careful before they send anybody to prison for possessing a small quantity of cannabis, I suggest that the option of prison ought to be available to mark the severity with which society should regard the possession of dangerous drugs in any form. The amendment would, in the true sense of the phrase, be the thin end of the wedge which we should not allow to be inserted into our social framework in any form at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend, in moving the new clause, emphasised that we are talking here about the possession of cannabis, and not the supplying and pushing of it, as my hon. Friend called it. I am glad, too, that he emphasised that nobody here is saying—and the new clause does not say—that the possession of it should not be a criminal offence. We are agreed that the possession of cannabis should be a criminal offence. What we are actually discussing is how such a person who is convicted of that offence, should be sentenced.<br><br>
In passing, I should like to say a few words about the effect of the drug, although it is not perhaps relevant to whether we shall fine people or imprison them, but it is mentioned in this connection. I do not think—and here I part with my hon. Friend— that we can start down the road about whether or not it is more dangerous than tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco has its effects, alcohol has its effects, and cannabis has a third lot of effects. I do not think that it is useful or possible to compare the three, and whether we should legislate about the other two.<br><br>
We have a fresh report which apparently came to the Home Office only this week—yesterday, I believe. It was commissioned by the Home Office, as if the Department knew we were going to debate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0441">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 551</span>
this subject today, from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. When I study the council's conclusions, it is clear that the case is not proven. The more one reads through it, the more this comes out. First, the report says that there is insufficient evidence to say firmly that cannabis is harmful. This does not, therefore, mean that cannabis is harmless. All the report is able to state is that it is not possible to say that it is harmful. But there is no undertaking that it is harmless.<br><br>
My hon. Friend said that what caused him the most apprehension about the report was that it could impair his ability to drive a motor car. I would say that he should be caused far more apprehension by the fact that high levels of cannabis smoking, according to the report, significantly reduces a man's reproductive capacity.<br><br>
Thirdly, the report says that far more research is needed on human beings because most of the research so far done has been done on animals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene. My point was that whereas I did not want to go into the consequences of heavy uses of cannabis, even light uses of cannabis would seem to me to carry the danger associated with driving motor cars, to which I drew attention. I was not actually saying anything about heavy uses of the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Often when one does something lightly, one can proceed to doing it heavily, particularly in the drug world. The research that was done here was mainly done on animals, so it is totally irrelevant to a large extent to human beings.<br><br>
The final conclusion was that there is insufficient evidence for incontestable conclusions to be made about the effects of cannabis. So, at the end of the day, we do not really know what the effect of this drug in small, large or continuous doses is on human beings. Certainly, there is a problem that getting into the habit of cannabis can lead people on to much harder drugs which are not cannabis at all but something far worse.<br><br>
So much for those findings, but in supporting the new clause I go back to the Home Secretary's point, which I keep quoting, that prison is only justified if the behaviour of the offenders constitutes a significant threat to society. Here we are talking about users and not suppliers of the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trlppier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Lady keeps quoting at us the words of my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, but I am sure my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary would agree with me, as would the Minister, that we should also consider the deterrent aspect of imprisonment. I wonder if she could actually address a few remarks to whether she accepts that imprisonment in this regard, bearing in mind that she accepts that the taking of cannabis can lead to greater things, could be a deterrent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the onus is very much upon those who want custodial sentences to show that it is a deterrent. I have seen no evidence that somebody who is using cannabis or wants to use
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 552</span>
cannabis, is deterred from doing it because there is a possible prison sentence in existence for him if he is caught. If the Minister can provide that evidence, I would be very interested to hear it. I would be interested to hear if cannabis users who have been in prison then do not commit the offence again, or are not convicted again. That is the sort of evidence I would like to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a danger of this whole discussion getting into a semantic fairyland. The mere fact that society profoundly disapproves of something and provides a prison sentence as one of the things which can happen on conviction in itself deters people from going down that road. They will not be the kind of people of whom studies can be made because they are frequent offenders. It marks society's deep disapproval of a particular course of conduct and it deters people from approaching it in any way. It causes them, rightly, to shun away from it in a way that parking fines or fines in other areas simply do not do. Does the hon. Lady not recognise that aspect of deterrents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Over and over again in our discussions on this Bill in Committee we have produced evidence in relation to other clauses where research work done by many bodies has shown that prison sentences do not necessarily deter people from committing an offence, prevent them recommitting an offence when they have left prison or becoming recidivists.<br><br>
I can only draw the Committees attention to evidence which has been produced about the effect of custodial sentences. This has been coming up in so many of our discussions.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the latest <i>Daily Telegraph</i> figures show that there are 8,000,000 cannabis users in the country. Surely this shows that imprisonment has not been a deterrent on those who have been sent there? There is a vast number of people beyond the number who have been imprisoned who continue to use cannabis and are not deterred by the threat of going to prison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Minister will give us a great many facts and figures about how many in the country he believes to be using cannabis who have not so far been convicted of the offence and the recidivism among those who have been in prison convicted of using cannabis. I share the view expressed by one of my hon. Friends who said that this is essentially a medical and social problem as well as simply a criminal offence. We are all agreed it is still a criminal offence, but these people need social and medical advice and care. I would have thought that this would be far more effective in treating cannabis users than simply locking them up, letting them out, and saying "Now don't do it again ". For all these reasons I would support my hon. Friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maynew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of this has not been fully explored. I refer to the new clause, but it could equally be said of cannabis itself.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0442">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 553</span>
The clause removes the option of imprisonment following summary conviction of possession of cannabis or cannabis resin. The option of imprisonment would remain for those convicted on indictment and for trafficking offences, including possession with intent to supply. The lower courts would in consequence lose the power to impose not only immediate prison sentences, but suspended sentences, community service orders and hospital orders under the Mental Health Act, although they could commit to a higher court for sentencing.<br><br>
The Government cannot accept this new clause, which seeks to remove the option of imprisonment in the services that I have described. We do not believe that it would be right, first, to deprive the lower courts entirely of the option of a short custodial penalty in an appropriate case, whether immediate or suspended, nor do we think it would be right to deprive them of the opportunity of a partially-suspended sentence if the order before the House and clause 25 of the Bill are approved by Parliament.<br><br>
Also, we think it important that they should continue to have the option of a community service or hospital order under the Mental Health Act.<br><br>
The Committee is aware that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs established by the Misuse of Drugs Act to advise the Government on all aspects of drug abuse asked a group of eminent experts to assess the evidence of the harmfulness of cannabis misuse. The group's report, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House, states after a very careful assessment that there is insufficient evidence to reach any incontestable conclusions and that more research is needed, especially with regard to long-term effects.<br><br>
As long as there is substantial uncertainty about the harm caused by cannabis, the Government take the view—it is a view that the Advisory Council itself expressed—that a cautious approach to any change in the present law is necessary. Even before this report on the evidence as to harm was available, a substantial minority of the Council— 11 as against 16—were evidently not prepared to go along with the recommendation for a reduction of penalties, and their cautious counsel is, in the Government's view, the right one for a responsible Government to take at this stage.<br><br>
I think it is worth while detaining the Committee for a few moments to refer to what that substantial minority said. They said in paragraph 3.16:
<br><blockquote><p>"The scientific evidence could not be pushed to a premature verdict, and the risks to the population of long-term exposure to cannabis, possibly at dose levels with which we are now in the Western world unfamiliar, remained an open but worrying question."</p></blockquote>
The latest report of the expert group)—the "yellow report" referred to by the hon. Lady—does not appear to invalidate that opinion in any way. Paragraph 6.5 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our colleagues who held the views expressed in paragraph 3.16 above objected to this proposal"—</p></blockquote>
it is referring there to the minority—
<br><blockquote><p>"on the grounds that it was untimely to take legislative action which could as a side-effect be seen as conveying
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
to the public a message that the Advisory Council had now reassessed the possible risks to the individual and community of cannabis use, and deemed those risks to be substantially less than scientific opinion had previously believed. This would undermine that aspect of preventive policy which is concerned with demand reduction … when there was factually no scientific basis for a reassessment in the direction which might seem to be implied. Tie recommended changes in the law might have as their cost an adverse educational impact while probably at the same time having as their gain only a small real impact on sentencing practice. Such tampering was not justified."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that it would be responsible for the Government in today's circumstances to accept a change in the law such as that represented by the new clause. I appreciate that it is not seeking to legalise the drug, but I believe that the educational signal—to use the words in the report I have just quoted—might very well be extremely dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman say what sort of evidence he is looking for, that would enable him to take the view that imprisonment for possession of a small amount of cannabis is not an appropriate penalty? What sort of evidence would he seek to rely on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, perhaps the Minister will not forget my question as to how many are now in prison for this offence, and what is the recidivism rate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One has to approach any amendment with the basic attitude that the law is as it is. One has to ask oneself what would be the implications of an alleviation of that law. Here we are dealing with something that is potentially dangerous —that is common ground. We are dealing with something the extent of whose dangeous potential is unknown. We are dealing with something in which a body of experts considers that caution with regard to the changing of the law is prudent and is the right policy.<br><br>
That being the position from which we are starting, we would be very rash as a Government to say that we would run the risk of giving a green light to cannabis using, that we would accept that this would be seen as the thin end of a wedge and that a bit more pressure would open the split a bit more. I do not think that would be a prudent and sensible thing to do. We shall have to wait and see what the conclusions are as a result of the additional research that is going on. Meanwhile I believe it to be the right advice to the Committee that we should retain the penalties that are established and which are well undersood.<br><br>
I shall turn to what the hon. Lady has asked—or part of it at any rate—in a moment. I said that I did not think it wise to give any signal that could be interpreted as the Government or Parliament being more lenient towards the use or the possession of cannabis. There is also the question of the practical effect of such an amendment.<br><br>
In 1980, of the 10,000 or so person who were found guilty under the Misuse of Drugs Act, or who were cautioned solely for possessing cannabis, only 150 were given an immediate custodial sentence by lower courts. Taking into account the average
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 555</span>
level of sentence imposed, and allowing for remission, the likely effect on the prison population at any one time of removing the power of imprisonment, is estimated at a maximum of 20 persons.<br><br>
Even this figure is somewhat theoretical for the following reasons. All those 150 offenders were either convicted at the same time for other offences, or had previous convictions. Had the new clause been in force then, it is probable that at least some of those who were sentenced at the same time for other offences, would still have received a custodial sentence, and those with previous convictions might have been committed to a higher court for sentence, if the lower court was unable to award a custodial sentence.<br><br>
Therefore, the effect of the new clause on the prison population would at best be marginal. If the new clause were adopted, magistrates would lose the power to impose these other sentences of suspended sentence, community service orders, hospital orders, and so on, to which I have referred. The lower courts have found some of those sentencing options useful. In 1980, of those whose sole offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act was unlawful possession of cannabis, about 200 received suspended sentences, and a similar number community service orders.<br><br>
Do we want to deprive the magistrates' courts of those options? A very small number was made the subject of hospital orders. We do not consider that the sentencing practice adopted by the courts under the present law is so inappropriate as to require parliamentary intervention in the present state of medical knowledge.<br><br>
I conclude with a statement bearing upon medical knowledge. I cite the concluding paragraph of a paper prepared for the expert group to which we referred, which is advising the Advisory Council. It has been prepared by the head of the addiction research unit at the Maudesley hospital, Professor Griffith Edwards. He puts the conclusion of his paper in these terms:
<br><blockquote><p>"The final conclusion should probably be that the possibility and significance of a dependence potential for cannnabis must be taken more seriously than has been the case in some debates over the last ten years. It has not been shown that cannabis has a clean bill of health in this regard and some of the indicators are worrying ".</p></blockquote>
In the light of all those circumstances, I have no doubt whatsoever that I must advise the Committee that the new clause, limited though it is in its extent, must be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: am sorry that the Minister was quite so hard-faced in opposing the new clause. I did not anticipate his accepting it, but I suggest that the argument about cannabis is becoming polarised in a silly way. I have never smoked or drunk in my life. My drugs are something else. They are certainly not cannabis. We are not going back to the previous discussion. That is not a drug. My weight would be less if I did not use an alternative for alleviating nervous disorder.<br><br>
The true difficulty, I find, in discussion with people who actually smoke cannabis, is how those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 556</span>
who regularly get drunk on alcohol can claim that cannabis is a more serious drug than alcohol. By any test at all, it is not. If I had my way, if I were dictator, I would no doubt say that we ought not to have any drug at all, but society asks for a social drug. Society has espoused two social drugs. One is nicotine and the other is alcohol.<br><br>
Nicotine has now been proved to be so detrimental to health that even the Government are coming round to the view that it has to be limited in some way, and possibly ultimately proscribed. I suspect that had the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) remained at the Department of Health and Social Security, it would not have been long before there would have been a campaign about alcohol as an abuse, too. The truth of the matter is that alcohol is a more dangerous drug, and has much worse social effects than cannabis.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
I would not want to decriminalise cannabis. Most of the argument used by the Minister against the suggestion of decriminalising cannabis, which is not what is intended. All we are saying is that cannabis is not a serious drug such as heroin or cocaine and that we ought to treat it for what it is—something that we do not want to encourage but not something to be considered as a serious social evil in the same v/ay as hard drugs.<br><br>
On that basis, it may merit keeping it as a crime and having fines to penalise it, but it does not merit imprisonment. Although it took me some time to get to that stage, I am convinced now that we ought to de-penalise it and take away imprisonment as a penalty. Although the Minister can produce the odd expert who is so equivocal in his opinion that I should not have thought it counted for very much, I am certain that we could produce expert opinion which goes the other way in saying that cannabis does not create a dependence factor and, unlike alcohol, is not something to which people become addicted. The evidence from cannabis users sugests that they do not get the addiction in anything like the way that people become addicted to alcohol.<br><br>
We ought to have a more serious discussion about cannabis. I recognise that the Government are not yet in the position to say that they want to remove imprisonment, but we should have a more serious discussion about it so that the public understand what we are talking about. When people talk about drugs nowadays, they think that cannabis is equivalent to heroin. It is not, and never will be. For that reason, we should not treat people who smoke cannabis in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) said that the new clause was 20 years ahead of its time. I do not think that was an accurate statement of the argument. According to the Minister, of the 10,000 people last year who were convicted for the possession of cannabis, 150 receiver custodial sentence. So, in effect, the social sanction that society imposes through the courts on people who possess cannabis is overwhelmingly not that of imprisonment. We are almost at the point suggested by the new clause.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 557</span>
The Minister emphasised that his was a cautious approach. I should have thought that the approach underlying the new clause was cautious. All it seeks to do is to take away the possibility of imprisonment for the possession of cannabis from 150 people a year out of a total of 10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understood the Minister correctly, the figures are even more in favour of my hon. Friend's argument. I understood the Minister to say that of the 150 a large proportion had committed other offences, presumably connected with cannabis, perhaps dealing and selling. So the numbers sent to prison for the pure possession of a small quantity of cannabis were very low. It seems to indicate that the courts now do not take a serious view of possession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. and learned Friend for drawing my attention to that fact. The view of the general public on what the law does, and how strongly society condemns the use of cannabis, is surely influenced much more by the knowledge that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 558</span>
the vast majority of people convicted of the offence will not receive a custodial sentence and that the very small percentage likelihood of anyone receiving a custodial sentence is unlikely to have a deterrent effect on the others who will take a chance, safe in the knowledge that they are not likely to be given a custodial sentence if they are convicted.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I listened very hard to what the Minister had to say. I am not influenced by his main argument, but I am influenced by the fact that his considered view is that the effect of the new clause would also be to take away from courts the right to impose community service orders and it would also weaken the position of the courts as regards mental health legislation. For those two reasons, and those two reasons only, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
