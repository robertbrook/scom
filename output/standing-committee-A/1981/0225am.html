	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin, Mr. Watkins, with a warm welcome to you to our Committee proceedings. Although we are sad not to have Mr. Dean with us, we know that we shall benefit from your guidance of our affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of our last sitting I was asked a number of questions in the course of some excellent speeches on the debate that clause 9 stand part of the Bill, and I hope that I may take a little time to reply to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) asked what establishments would serve as remand centres. There was some interest in that general point so perhaps I could begin by saying a little on that. New section 43 (1) of the Prison Act 1952 provides the definition for remand centres. They are described as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"places for the detention of persons not less than fourteen but under twenty-one years of age who are remanded or committed in custody for trial or sentence.</p></blockquote>
Section 43 (2) goes further by saying that although statutory provision for remand centres was first made in 1948, none of the establishments now called remand centres has been legally designated as such. In law they are still prisons. The main reason why no remand centres have been designated is that the present law imposes certain inflexible requirements that cannot be satisfied in practice. Once the Bill is in force, including clause 9, the modifications to the law that are necessary to remove these difficulties will have been made and the existing remand centres will be legally designated as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline briefly what the inflexible requirements of the present law are. First, the Secretary of State is obliged to provide facilities in remand centres for the observation of any person detained there on whose physical or mental condition the court wants a medical report. There is no similar obligation in respect of any other type of establishment. It is not considered feasible to provide permanent facilities for the medical observation of offenders in all remand centres. For example, a
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
remand centre is quite often attached to, or is close to a local prison where there are facilities for medical examination, and therefore it is not practicable to comply with this requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further necessary modification in the use of remand centres is made in the new section 43 (2), which provides that a woman aged 21 years or over who is serving a sentence of imprisonment, or who has been committed to prison for default may, as the Secretary of State may from time to time direct, be detained in a remand centre or a youth custody centre instead of a prison. The reason for this is set out in paragraph 25 of the White Paper, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because of the relatively small number of women in custody, it has not in recent years been considered necessary or desirable to enforce a strict segregation between the various age groups; indeed, it is generally considered to be positively beneficial for younger women to share facilities with suitable adults. This practice will be continued where approprate."</p></blockquote>
The third requirement of the existing law, which is impracticably inflexible, is met by the new section 43(2) of the Prison Act which will be created by the Bill. A woman aged 21 or over who is remanded in custody or committed in custody for trial can be held in a remand centre instead of prison. The need for this arises because there are few womens' prisons and many parts of the country are a long way from an establishment that can hold adult women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three of the places that are now called remand centres—Pucklechurch, Low Newton and Risley—do have facilities for women. They are in law still prisons, and if under the present law they become remand centres, it will no longer be possible to hold adult women in them. Without these centres, the women's system will not be able to cope with the reception and production in court of women remanded in custody. It is therefore necessary to take statutory power to hold them in remand centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if the hon. and learned Gentleman is coming to what the White Paper said on the subject, which I quoted in the last debate. Is he saying that the reason why adult women prisoners are put in with young girls, who could be 15 years-old, is purely geographical, or is he saying that it is appropriate to do so in certain cases and that it could be beneficial, which was the implication of the White Paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come to that, but I shall deal with it now. The hon. Lady has raised the matter and it is germane to what I have just been saying. It is not the only reason. Our experience is that in the case of young female offenders there is benefit to be gained through an association between the slightly older age group and the younger age group. Our experience of the behaviour of young male offenders is different. The differences in experience lead us to the view that there is advantage to be gained, among other things a settling influence or younger female offenders by certain suitably selected slightly older ones. However, not everything is capable of formulation in a neat tabular structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
A great deal of importance must be attached to the actual experience of dealing with these extremely difficult creatures called " human beings ". Some Labour Members may experience difficulty in contemplating the fact that people are not readily allocatable into neat and tidy compartments. I was asked by the hon. Lady why there is this difference. The answer is that experience shows that young men behave differently from young women. So we are not doing this solely for reasons of convenience. We also find that behavioural advantage is to be gained as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I shall ponder and consider his report to the Committee that young men behave differently from young women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found one point in his observations a little difficult and perhaps he can help me. As I understand the general view which is expressed of women in custody, a very high percentage are psychiatric cases or women who are disturbed in one way or another. If that is right, how can that fact be reconciled with the greater benefit that the younger girl is likely to derive from contact with older women?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter for individual selection. There is no hard and fast rule and each case differs from the next one. Plainly, there will be circumstances where to place the young in contact with an older female offender who has a particularly different psychiatric problem would not be at all appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we turned to the provisions relating to sentenced young women and girls, the hon. Member for Barking drew attention to the increase in the number of girls coming into custody. She suggested that the White Paper had not given sufficient prominence to this side of the problem. I do not think that that is so, and I certainly welcome the chance to correct that impression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, as the hon. Lady rightly says, there has been a significant rise over the years in the number of young women coming into custody, from 491 receptions in 1970 to 1,018 in 1980. Juvenile girls account for a fairly small proportion of this increase—receptions rose from 41 in 1970 to 77 in 1980—as do borstal trainees of all ages. Receptions increased here from 305 in 1970 to 379 in 1980. The really notable rise has been in young prisoners and fine defaulters. There receptions rose from 152 in 1970 to 634 in 1980. For the women's system of establishments, which is fairly small, that has been a substantial increase. Against that, the number of girls in custody is still only a small proportion of the numbers of boys. In 1980, the 1,018 young women and girls received into custody compares with 28,191 young men and boys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why the White Paper did not say much specifically about girls is that many imporatant respects the provisions for them will be similar to those for boys. They have been discussed separately only where differences are necessary in the provisions made for them. I shall come to those differences
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
when discussing the other points that have been raised by members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the point I was trying to make, could he say specifically what it is intended to do with Bullwood Hall. That is the point that some of us tried to make. Will it simply have its name changed or is it to go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First of all, Bullwood Hall is a modern purpose-built establishment and we cannot contemplate its closure, but it can be a difficult establishment to run, not surprisingly, because there is a high proportion of disturbed young people there and the fact that a large number of them have to be held a long way from home is an added disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that I subscribe to everything that has recently been said in publicity about Bull-wood Hall. Certainly, we all wish to acknowledge the devotion of the staff at that institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking up a point made by the hon. Lady during the last sitting, it is true that drugs are administered more frequently in female establishments than in male. That is based on need, not just the medical officers' perceptions of need. The Committee may be interested to know that whereas one in 21 of the people received in Prison Department establishments after sentence in 1980 was female, one in eight of those remanded in custody for medical reports was female. There are two ways in which we hope that the new sentencing scheme, and the allocation arrangements we propose under it, can help Bull-wood Hall and its inmates. First, we propose to place an adult offenders unit in Bullwood Hall. We think that that will bring the sort of benefits that I have described from the mixing of different age groups. Secondly, if we put some adults into Bull-wood Hall, we can create places for young offenders elsewhere, enabling us to hold them in more locations around the country. I hope that that, incidentally, will do something to overcome the difficulty of detention far away from home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman not realise that what he has just announced makes the difficulties worse, not better? We are not complaining about Bullwood Hall in itself. We are not saying that there is something inherently or intrinsically wrong with that particular institution or its staff. The complaint is about its location and its inaccessibility, particularly for those parents, relatives, probation officers, social workers, of girls located there but who live and come from the North and Narth-West—indeed, from my own constituency. If the Minister is now saying that one of the ways in which to overcome the disadvantages from which Bullwood Hall suffers is to locate an adult centre there as well, the same kind of difficulties that currently apply to the young girls will apply in future to the adults who will be located there? While we do not expect him to announce today, tomorrow, or next month, that Bull-wood Hall is to be closed, it would help if he would accept the arguments that have been put forward,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
not just here but outside, by the Magistrates' Association, and by probation officers, that Bullwood Hall is in an inappropriate location, and that what is needed there is a dispersal of smaller units attached to adult prisons, not the relocation of adults at Bullwood Hall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my hon. Friend's point. One of the problems at Bullwood Hall, we are told, is that these girls are very often violent and mentally disturbed. I do not see how putting adult women with them will necessarily solve this problem. What evidence has the Minister, from research or any previous practice of this kind, that the treatment of violent delinquent behaviour is simply to mix them with adult women criminals? As my hon. Friend said, people who have studied this problem think that one partial solution is to see that these girls have more visits from outside—parents, relatives or friends—not criminal adults, but adults from outside the prison system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for both these interventions. I absolutely understand the nature of the criticisms that have been made of Bullwood Hall, and I suspect that if we all had our time over again, Bullwood Hall would probably not have been sited where it is. Equally, I fully understand the desirability, especially in the case of young offenders in custody, of enabling them to keep their links with family and with the community, and that means being as near home as possible. Of course that is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to say at the outset that in today's circumstances, having regard to the fact that Bull-wood Hall is a relatively new, purpose-built institution, we simply are not able to say that because of the shortcomings that are acknowledged in its siting, we are going to write it off. We cannot do that in today's circumstances. We ought, therefore, to try to mitigate the acknowledged shortcomings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept that in making the variations in the age of offenders who will be confined there we should, wherever possible, seek to ensure that the offenders will be those whose homes are nearer rather than further away. I am certain that the Prison Department will want to have that consideration very much in mind, but I shall return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has asked how putting some older female offenders in a special unit will mitigate the difficulties at Bullwood Hall. I will deal with that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a mistake to say that simply by putting older offenders in a special unit at Bullwood Hall nothing will be done to overcome the problems of distance. I know very well that the Prison Department attaches great importance to having offenders, wherever possible, not very far away from their homes. This is a very important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the hon. Lady's point and I shall expand what I was saying earlier on. First of all, there are three main reasons why the Bill permits mixing of age groups in female establishments. Long experience of dealing with women and girls who have been given sentences of imprisonment suggests
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
that the mixing of selected individuals—a point I tried to emphasise—with the other age groups benefits both sides. It introduces greater stability into the younger group and it gives a greater sense of responsibility and maturity to the older group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has asked why female offenders should, in this respect, be different from male offenders, and I have tried to indicate that the answer lies in the prison service's experience of dealing with each category in custody. We do not think that the same principles can usefully be applied in male establishments. I have not had experience of dealing with male or female offenders in custody. I rather doubt whether anybody who has not had that experience can speak with great authority about it, though each of us would expect certain things to follow and each of us would have certain expectations and possibly prejudices. This is what I understand to be the firmly held view of those who have had this experience on our behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason is that it should help us to place more young female offenders nearer to their homes, which assists not only family contact and visits but also with preparation for release and it will provide a wider choice of opportunities and outlets for young women than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further reason is that the smaller size of the women's and girls' system does not permit such a strict separation between types of accommodation. Facilities need to be shared and some establishments cannot easily be subdivided. Those are the principal reasons. We shall be looking for suitable individuals. We shall exclude from mixing with young offenders those adults who have convictions for offences against children, offences of murder or attempted murder, serious violence or arson, or those who are serious drug addicts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to spend more time answering the debate because I believe I have in the last twenty-five minutes dealt reasonably fully with the points raised. I believe that this clause provides a sensible structure for the provision of premises for young offenders. It is of essential importance to the Bill and I believe that the Committees will wish to see it stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it would be right to detain the Committee for long after the Minister has spoken, but he will agree that he has given fresh information and it would be right to comment a little on that. I should also like to raise a totally different point on the structure of this clause. I am not by any means opposed to the idea of bringing carefully selected adult prisoners into contact with the young. On the contrary I can well see that that would be advantageous to both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, there are many people who take that view, and many prison systems act upon the view that enabling people to feel that they are playing a part in redeeming and helping others is an extremely valuable part of their own rehabilitation. From the point of view of the selected adults, in addition to the point of view of the young offenders, there are many advantages. I assume, although the Minister did not specifically mention the category of disturbed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
women, that seriously disturbed women would be excluded from those selected, unless it were felt on very strong evidence that they were suitable in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once one has accepted that principle, so far as women are concerned, I find it difficult to see why the same principle could not and should not be applicable to men. Once one has accepted that there must be selection so that one has the type of person who is likely not only to benefit himself or herself, but also to be of benefit to the young offender, what difference is there between men and women in this respect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister and the Home Office will not simply go on past experience, which may not have been based on the clear policy the Minister is now enunciating, but rather upon a kind of haphazard bringing together which has arisen in the past for reasons with which we are all too familiar. I hope that this is a general question which could be seriously studied to see whether assistance could not be given to the development of the penal system to apply this both to men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most interesting experiments that I saw when the Royal Commission visited the United States was an establishment in California, where the policy went even further and brought the penal establishment very much within the neighbouring township. It was an accepted thing for citizens of the neighbouring township to get to know and, as it were, adopt prisoners in that establishment. When it first started it was probably regarded as an evil, but by the time we examined that establishment it was regarded very much as part of people's lives and the help that they gave to the prisoners was enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, in many cases they formed associations which led to employers offering employment to prisoners when they left. I saw something similar when I visited Styal prison which was built in the face of heavy opposition from the local population. But by the time that I saw it some years later there was a remarkable co-operation between the villagers and the women there. I hope that all these matters will be studied and that sort of policy developed when we come to decide on the location and manner of operation of penal establishments in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say a little about the clause as a piece of drafting. It is a typical modern piece of drafting which creates the greatest conceivable difficulties for anyone who wants to understand and apply it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Blame the parliamentary draftsmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not blame the parliamentary draftsmen because I know that they are always racing against time. I am sure that if they were told they could have as long as they liked to draft a Bill they would do it in a very different way, but because they are racing against time they have to do it by this terrible process of insertions from one
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
Act into another. The clause is a substitution for a section in the Prison Act 1952, and they have to do it by cross-reference. For example, we find that in order to understand clause 9(2)(c) in its translated form as part of the Prison Act 1952, we have to go to section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act and section 23(3) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, because the provision in clause 9(2)(c) is " notwithstanding anything" contained in those measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (4) we find that in order to abbreviate and save time, certain sections of " this Act"—that is, the Prison Act 1952—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall apply to remand centres, detention centres and youth custody centres and to persons detained in them as they apply to prisons and prisoners."</p></blockquote>
So we have to go back to the 1952 Act and look at all the provisions in the sections mentioned in subsection (4) to find out what is applicable to remand centres, detention centres and youth custody centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (5) we find that the other provisions "of this Act"—that is the Prison Act 1952 again—except for certain sections, apply to all the centres already mentioned but in this case
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to such adaptations and modifications as may be specified in rules made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
We must then see whether any rules apply in such cases and we have to consider how those rules may modify the provisions of the 1952 Act in its application to these establishments, other than sections 28 and 37(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I allowed my right hon. and learned Friend to expand the point because a former law officer acquitting the parliamentary draftsmen of blame is like whitewashing the Devil. The truth is that the White Paper came out in December 1980 and the parliamentary draftsmen have had more than a year in which to deal with the Bill. There is no question of their being short of time. The trouble is simply due to the attitude of the parliamentary draftsmen which, as a former law officer, my right hon. and learned Friend knows only too well. They decide how they draft Bills and they do not let Ministers interfere in that. It is about time that this was stopped. We can only stop it if it is brought out into the open, and if the attitude of Ministers who say that the parliamentary draftsmen must never be criticised changes. It is like the Civil Service, which must never be criticised. Things are always the Minister's responsibility. It is not the Minister's responsibility at all. The parliamentary draftsmen will never let a Minister near a Bill and my right hon. and learned Friend knows that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend that I am not someone who has never criticised parliamentary draftsmen. When I take the view that criticism of the draftsmen is required, I make it. Parliamentary draftsmen are highly skilled and often idiosyncratic. They do not all draft in the same way, but the fact that the White Paper was issued a long time ago does not derogate from what I was saying. It is the Government—in this case the Home Office together, no doubt, with the Lord

	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
President—who decide at what stage the parliamentary draftsmen should be taken off other urgent drafting and put on to this. It happens again and again, in my experience. My hon. Friend should know from his Government experience that, when it comes to the point, they have too little time to do the job, and I can well understand that on a Bill of this complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made my point and I need not go on to subsection (7). I understand why these kinds of cross reference and insertion, however undesirable, are from time to time necessary. But I hope that on a major Bill such as this, steps are taken even before it is introduced to ensure as early, speedy and comprehensive a consolidation as possible. Certainly in this case there is every reason why that should be so. I hope that what I have said may spur the Government on to ensure that that takes place, so that those who want to look at the system in future will not have to go through this terrible process of going from one Act to another and often to rules and regulations as well, which makes it extremely difficult to find out what the law really is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without detaining the Committee for more than 30 seconds, I simply say in reply to the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), that Ministers take the responsibility for the drafting. In my short experience of Government, I certainly have not found that one is warned off the sacred ground of drafting, but there are considerations of time and Parliament is always changing its mind. If we were to embark on drafting the brand new, definitive and consolidated statute that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would like—and so should I—we should have to wait for many more months and, I suspect, years, before reforms in the Bill which are common ground as being desirable were brought about. We do want a consolidating one, and though I do not govern these matters, I look forward with some confidence during our next term of office to being able to meet the right hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never have intervened in this clause stand part debate had it not been for the words of the Minister a moment ago. I was once appointed to a committee to consider the revision of statute law under Lord Scarman. I remember the attitude of the chief parliamentary draftsman on that committee. It has been with me ever since. Whenever we asked a question involving any kind of delicate handling for the parliamentary draftsmen, he used to say, " Well, that is the view of the office." The view of the office prevailed over very other consideration. I talked to a number of Ministers during my period in office and they all had the same reception for any suggestion they made to the parliamentary draftsmen for improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that we shall never get it right unless this issue is brought out into the open. Judges go on complaining bitterly about the nature of draftsmanship. There has to be a full public debate about the nature of drafting and the role of the parliamentary draftsmen. As long as Ministers go on
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
doing what two hon. Members have been doing today—excusing them and saying that it is all the responsibility of Ministers—the longer we shall go on with this nonsense of drafting what is totally illegible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

to be added after the words "in a prison". The English, at least, is questionable even if the subject matter is not. That is on page 9, line 27. It then reads:

	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would prevent juveniles serving youth custody sentences from being placed in adult prisons. Clause 10(2) makes provision for people serving youth custody sentences of between four and 18 months, who would normally be detained in a youth custody centre, to be detained
	<br><blockquote><p>"for any temporary purpose in a prison."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) provides for those serving youth custody sentences of other lengths to be detained either in a youth custody centre or a remand centre or, again, in an adult prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Magistrates' Association has pointed out that, on the face of it, this would enable juvenile offenders—those aged 15 and 16—who are sentenced to youth custody to be detained in adult prisons in the course of their sentences, even though at the moment no one, as the Minister will well know, under the age of 17 can be sentenced to imprisonment. The Magistrates' Association has already asked the Home Office for an assurance that these provisions of the Bill will not apply to juveniles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my understanding that that assurance has not yet been given and part of the purpose of tabling these amendments is precisely to seek such a clear and unequivocal assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to tell the Committee again about the undesirability of detaining 15 or 16-year-olds in overcrowded adult prisons where the conditions, as we all well know—not only from the debates in this Committee but from what we have heard in recent weeks from Wormwood Scrubs, Gloucester and Pentonville and elsewhere—are the most appalling in all the penal estate. The staff are geared to running a prison essentially for adult prisoners, not to meet the needs of young prisoners and certainly not to meet the very peculiar problems of juveniles
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will not mind if I remind it just once more that the inappropriateness of holding juveniles in adult prisons is also- endorsed by the prison and borstal governors. It was the prison and borstal governors who referred to the conditions in which juveniles were being held in adult prisons,
	<br><blockquote><p>"nothing short of a national scandal".</p></blockquote>
It is bad enough that anybody serving a youth custody sentence should be detained in the conditions that are described as occurring in the adult prison system, but for those under 17 to be subjected to them is equally, or even more, deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be extremely unfair on young offenders, and unfair on the court in passing a youth custody sentence on somebody of that age, which would normally intend that he or she would be serving a sentence not in an adult prison but in a proper youth custody centre. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give a clear assurance that the principles of the amendments are such that he endorses and supports them and would like to see them carried into effect. I hope that he will provide the assurance that the Magistrates' Association has been, and still is, seeking or perhaps more simply and efficaciously, that he will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a great deal of sympathy with the thinking that lies behind the hon. Gentleman's two amendments. He is right in saying that the Bill forbids a sentence of imprisonment on a juvenile. There are, however, circumstances that will rebound to the advantage of a juvenile, exceptionally, in permitting the Secretary of State to direct that a juvenile may be detained—not sentenced—in certain circumstances in a prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is threefold. To enable the efficient allocation of offenders sentenced to youth custody, just like borstal trainees and young prisoners now, young offenders will after sentence be received direct from court into local prisons, which are the establishments that serve the courts. Incidentally, they are normally closest to families, probation officers, and legal advisers, which can be particularly important just after a person has received a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The period is normally no more than a week for allocation. It is important that allocation should take place at the establishment which serves the court, and which normally will be near to the officers and agencies, and certainly to the families, as I have described. The process of allocation—interviewing, gathering of information, assessment, decision about where the person should go, and the actual transfer—should normally take about a week. We are anxious to make that process as quick as is consistent with the need to take proper decisions, so that the person can reach a training establishment without unnecessary delay. The local prison is the best place to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Direct committal from courts to training youth custody centres is not desirable because the establishments could not readily be geared to receiving direct from court. If they tried to gear themselves, they would take staff away from training activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will know that proper selection of individuals for open or closed conditions, and medical, psychiatric or educational facilities, would still require a form of allocation process, resources devoted to assessment units, and further transfers between establishments. Combined remand and allocation centres normally on urban sites, therefore local sites, such as urban prisons, for persons under 21, are, however, a possibility for the future. They are plainly desirable. That is currently under consideration in the context of the developing remand structure. They could not be established all at once, and certainly could not offer complete national coverage in the next two or three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the first practical reason. It is in the interests of young offenders that their allocation process should be as quick as possible, and that it should not detract from the resources available for training at the training youth custody centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second circumstance is that it will be used, in appropriate cases, for compassionate purposes. Although there will be about 30 youth custody centres for young men and boys, there will still be parts of the country without one, or without one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
that can hold a particular offender near to his home. If, for example, there are sudden and urgent family problems—for example, a relative who is seriously ill or dying, or a family cannot visit without great difficulty—it can be to the advantage of all concerned to transfer the young offender temporarily to a prison nearby where his family can make a series of visits in a short time, or from which he can be taken under escort to make a series of visits to his relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, in the last of the special cases or circumstances, it will be used for judicial purposes, for example, to enable an appearance in court, possibly in respect of a further offence or for an appeal, in a part of the country where there is no nearby youth custody centre or none with the requisite security. It is not better that the offender and his escorting staff should travel many miles each morning and night for several successive days. It is more sensible to have the power temporarily to detain him in a nearby prison where special arrangements will doubtless be made. The power may be used when an offender is in transit between establishments, purely to break the journey. It may occasionally be used when an offender has to be reallocated to a different youth custody centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing sinister in the proposal. There is no intent to get behind the main purpose of the Bill, which is to abolish the sentence of imprisonment for juveniles. It is simply to take account of practical, special circumstances such as I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. What he has said so far is perfectly understandable. Will he give me the clear and simple assurance—there appears to be no reason why he should not—that young offenders will be not so detained normally in the course of their sentence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If by " not so detained normally in the course of their sentence " the hon. Gentleman means not as a means of giving effect to the sentence, I can certainly say that that is not the Government's intention. That is not the purpose of the clause. Through a circular or by other means we shall ensure that guidance is provided on the circumstances in which the power can be used. The circular will probably deal with the operation of the allocation arrangements as a whole. I hope that that is a full and acceptable assurance of the bona fides of the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. and learned Gentleman's reasoning. I think that we all do. Can he say how many per year will be affected? He must have some figure for the young people or juveniles presently held for the purposes that he has listed—and which we understand—in adult prisons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understood the Minister, he said that any direction from the Secretary of State would be a specific direction in relation to a single offender. Will he give an assurance that it will never be used to cover classes of offenders generally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. and learned Member for Accringtcn (Mr. Davidson) an estimate of numbers because the circumstances to be catered for are so unpredictable. We do not know how many cases there will be where family emergencies arise, and so on. The Government expect that the numbers will be low, and kept to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman would allow me a little time to answer his question. I expect that there will be cases where a specific direction is given by the Secretary of State in respect of a specific offender. I do not want to close the door on a small class being identified. Directions can be specific, but often they will be covered by the general categories in the guidance, which will direct itself to the three types of circumstances that I have tried to describe this morning. Therefore, a direction might be given in such terms as to embrace one or other of the categories. There is nothing sinister in that. The Government's purpose in including the clause is wholly consistent with the key purpose of ensuring that juveniles are not sentenced to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give a specific answer to the hon. and learned Member for Accrington. There are 1,000 juveniles in custody at any one time and about 1,400 borstal receptions a year. It is difficult, indeed impossible, to quantify the numbers who will be affected from year to year by the proposed provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to say a word about the second of the amendments, No. 70, in response to the hon. Member for Ormskirk. It relates to young offenders who are not subject to the guarantee of training. We shall undertake to examine whether an alternative can be prepared that will go part way towards meeting his objective, without preventing the proper operation of the youth custody allocation system or removing the necessary power of holding in prison for a temporary purpose. I hope that he will accept that as an indication that we share his broad objective. We want to go as far as possible to meet that, while at the same time retaining the temporary powers that I have endeavoured to describe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the Minister has responded to my argument. I accept his three grounds on which it may sometimes be necessary to detain juveniles in adult prisons. I do not like it, and wish that it was not necessary. It would not be necessary if we had the will not to put juveniles, in any circumstances, at any time, in adult prisons. However, I accept the arguments of allocation, of compassionate circumstances and of the need for court appearances—the three heads that the Minister advanced. I can understand these points. I am grateful for the fair way in which he gave the assurance that the ability to detain juveniles in adult prisons would not be abused—in the same way, for example, as the ability to reclassify young offenders over the age of 18 has been abused. We shall discuss that point in a moment. I hope that he will go a little further and agree to monitor what happens when the Bill becomes law. I shall certainly do so. On the basis

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment need not detain the Committee for very long. It is not desired that an offender aged under 15 should be detained in any Prison Department establishment other than a detention centre. The detention order is the only custodial sentence for 14-year-old boys—except for a sentence under section 53 of the 1933 Act—and they cannot be remanded in custody. It was through an oversight that this provision would have allowed 14-year-olds with very short detention centre orders to be held in a remand centre, a youth custody centre or a prison. The amendment remedies that defect by restricting the whole of clause 10(7) to offenders aged 15 or over. That is the beginning and end of it and I believe that all members of the Committee will accept that it is a necessary amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 73, in page 10, line 10, leave out "the offender " and insert " he ".</p>
	<p>No. 74, in page 10, line 14, leave out "an offender " and insert " he ".—	<i>[Mr. Mayhew.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had been one of the parliamentary draftsmen dealing with clause 10, I would have said first that the provision contained in subsection (3) should stand as the first requirement of the clause. Subsection (3) says that any offender sentenced to youth custody—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is to be detained—
	<ol>
	<li>in a youth custody centre;</li>
	<li>in a remand centre; or</li>
	<li>in a prison ".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is what will happen to the great generality of those sentenced to youth custody. That would immediately tell anybody who read the clause what would be the generality of provision. However, it appears only in subsection (3). It is preceded by the qualification of subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point only to indicate that it was not necessary to take a long time to consider such an issue and that is an example of the nonsense of draftsmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted also to make the substantive point that if subsection (3) is taken as being the general provision, we are really saying that the Home Office
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
will determine where youth custody is served. So far we have had very little information about what is intended for those who will have to serve youth custody. At present those over the age of 17 can serve a period of imprisonment in a normal adult prison. Frequently they serve it in a young offenders' prison, which is often only a block in another sort of prison. It would be interesting if the Minister indicated to the Committee the intention of the Home Office. I suppose that that depends on how many people are sentenced to youth custody under these provisions. If the number sentenced to youth custody increases above the number of those between 17 and 21 now sentenced to borstal and to prison—I suspect that very shortly it will—it is inevitable that more and more offenders will serve youth custody in adult prisons. That will happen because our borstals and local prisons are so overcrowded. That is a reprehensible consequence of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no more able to foresee the future than any other member for the Committee. I cannot prove that that will happen but I suspect that it will be the long-term consequence of the Bill, which was allegedly designed to deal more effectively with juvenile delinquency. If the offenders go to adult prisons, there will be little hope of reformation. I have often indicated my scepticism about reformation, but if there is such a possibility it must be in this age group. If the Bill means that we send more and more to adult prisons, I have considerable doubts about its provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enter into the internecine warfare that has broken out on this side of the Committee over the bona fides or the control of those shadowy figures the parliamentary draftsmen. I should not venture to express a view, but having worked alongside my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) I am always predisposed to accept his view unless there are substantial arguments to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill guarantees a training place in a youth custody establishment only to those serving youth custody sentences of between four and 18 months. To that extent, it carries out the intention of the White Paper " Training Guarantee ". I quote from the notes on clauses with which the Minister has kindly provided us, and which have been most helpful. The White Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is … intended that all young adult offenders receiving short to medium sentences of youth custody will be guaranteed a place in a training establishment. Those receiving longer sentences will be placed in training establishments so far as vacancies permit, but no individual will be guaranteed such a place."</p></blockquote>
The effect, therefore, is that those serving sentences of more than 18 months will not be guaranteed a training place. Those serving longer sentences, who will be subject to all the dangers of institutional life, particularly young people, will be less likely to benefit from a regime of training intended to equip them for taking their places in the community and earning a proper living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, envisaged that there will be a shortage of places in youth custody establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
I therefore reiterate what my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) said, that the clause has to be seen in conjunction with the arguments that have been rehearsed over and over again, and which I do not intend to dwell upon, that tight criteria should be laid down for the courts so that only those on whom it is essential to impose custodial sentences should receive them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of regime does the Minister envisage for those serving sentences of more than 18 months and how will they be better equipped to take their place in the community as a whole? He will recall that the previous Labour Government's Green Paper devoted a considerable amount of space to setting up the nature of the regime which they hoped to bring about for new custody centres. It said that it should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"based on the best of existing practice in the borstal-system."</p></blockquote>
It proposed that educational activities should be related to the individual's future educational needs and employment prospects, and that educational courses should be designed to prepare the offender for further educational training in the community after release and during supervision. It proposed also that greater use should be made of day release courses in the community and that the training programme that it had in mind should be related especially to the offenders' home needs and intended to help them look after themselves in the community once they were released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many who previously would have been sent to borstal would have received that sort of training. Now the danger is that such training will not be received by them. Is it the Minister's long-term objective that all those sent to youth custody in future should receive proper training and should be assured of a training place? I hope that that is his long-term objective. Will he inform the Committee what sort of regime will exist for those who are not to receive a training place and for how long they will be subject to it, and whether he envisages that some offenders will not receive a training course at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reply to the important issues that have been raised in the speeches of the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) and the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As clause 10 recognises, through pressure of numbers we are likely to find that some young offenders cannot be held in youth custody centres. The only alternative will be to hold them in prison or possibly, in some cases, in remand centre accommodation. We do not intend to mix these young offenders with adults and separate accommodation will be used. In some cases limited daytime contact will be unavoidable—for example, occasionally in education classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of local prisons is undesirable because there are serious limits on the staff time and resources within the regimes for sentenced offenders in those prisons. But rather than ignore the prob-
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
lem, we think that it is more realistic and will be more to the benefit of young offenders to issue guidance to those establishments on how they should deal with sentenced young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still distinctive young offender requirements and objectives towards which the establishments should work. I acknowledge that they are not achieved as often as they should be, as the hon. Member for York said. The establishments are not always separate. Sometimes they are included in normal or adult prison establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are anxious that the resources that the establishments have are used in ways that are appropriate to the younger population. Thus, for example, young offenders should receive exercise appropriate to their age, educational opportunities, access to the employment facilities which are available and adequate preparation for their release under supervision. We hope in that way to ensure that, for young offenders who are unavoidably placed in prisons, the resources that we have for them are well directed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads directly to what the hon. and learned Member for Accrington asked about our long-term objectives. It is our hope and long-term objective that every young offender shall have access to training. It is because we recognise that our resources, especially accommodation, are limited that we have thought it right to give priority in the form of a guarantee of training for those who are sentenced to terms of between four and 18 months. I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that that is a sensible priority. I readily give the assurance that he asked for on the long-term objectives.

The hon. Member for York asked about allocation. Youth custody centres for male young offenders will comprise the 21 existing training borstals together with the 11 young prisoner centres or units which can operate training regimes. Allowing for some present sharing of sites, this will create 30 youth custody centres. They will not generally specialise in certain lengths of sentence except that five establishments will cater primarily for young offenders with sentences of over three years. Once youth custody trainees within the statutory guarantee range have been given their places, remaining youth custody centre vacancies will be allocated in the following order of priority: section 53s and young lifers; juvenile short-termers who are not subject to statutory training guarantee; young offenders of any sentence length needing psychiatric or other specialist oversight best provided in youth custody centres, and other young adults with sentences of more than three years; those with over 18 months to three years and those, on terms of 21 days to four months respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be the sensible way to allocate given that, unhappily, we do not have the resources that we would like to ensure that all young offenders have access to training when in custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
be the less serious offenders. Where are they to serve that period if the youth custody centres are full? Where will they go then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to the correction, the shortest termers will go to youth custody centres. However, it is unlikely in many cases, I would guess—we believe that the requirements of those in this category will place them at the bottom of the priority table for training places—that they will receive training. They will be in youth custody centres. I shall return to that issue as I may not have expressed myself entirely accurately. It seems that I was right to begin with and that I should not have corrected myself. The answer is " mainly in local prisons, occasionally in remand centres ". These are young offenders—I am more confident that I am right here—who are not physically or mentally fit for detention centre orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my deduction is correct, those who are now sent to borstal for a very short period may in future find themselves in local prisons serving youth custody orders of six months or thereabouts. The object of the scheme, which is to keep young people out of prison, will be overruled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We are talking about the category which was the last in the order of priority that I mentioned, those who are sentenced to terms of from 21 days to four months respectively. We are not talking about those who would have been sentenced to six months in a borstal institution. A person cannot be sent to borstal for a very short period, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows. The span is normally six months to two years. I shall return to that point if there is anything that I can usefully add.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to turn briefly to the numbers that I have been asked about. Youth custody centres will be formed from existing borstals and from the young prisoner centres that can operate a training regime. At present about 5,100 places are provided for male borstal trainees and 1,400 training places for male young prisoners—a total of 6,500 places. In 1983 youth custody centres should, therefore, hold three-quarters of the youth custody, custody for life or young defaulter population. Another one-tenth could be held in young offender wings and on working parties in remand centres, and the remaining 15 per cent, would need to be held in prisons in similar conditions to those of adults, but separate from adults. That is the breakdown. On that basis, 15 per cent, would need to be held in prisons, in similar conditions to, but separate from, adults.

	<div class='title'>CONVERSION OF SENTENCE OF YOUTH CUSTODY TO SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause empowers the Secretary of State to convert terms of youth custody to sentences of imprisonment in two circumstances—first, where the offender reaches the age of 21, which seems to be perfectly reasonable and, secondly, for those aged 18 and over whom boards of visitors have reported as being disruptive or as exercising a bad influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand why the Prison Department consider it necessary to have the power to reclassify young offenders aged 18 and over if they are proving to be a disruptive influence in the prison, and if they are presenting a management and control problem. But the Magistrates Association has suggested that the pressure of overcrowding in prisons has led to a much greater use of the power to reclassify young offenders as adults than would be justified purely and simply on the ground of disrup-tiveness. In its observations on the White Paper, the Magistrates Association expressed the hope that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State's powers to re-classify a young offender to adult status will be limited so that they cannot be used, as we think they have in recent years, merely to relieve the pressures on space in young offender establishments and that they will in any event be used sparingly-Otherwise the powers could be used in ways which would nullify the guarantees that young offenders sentenced to four months and over and up to 18 months would serve their sentences in designated training establishments."</p></blockquote>
The number of young offenders who have been reclassified as adults in recent years gives some credence to the suspicion that the Prison Department is using this power not to reclassify individuals who have become a nuisance but to reclassify them to relieve the overcrowding in young offender establishments. A parliamentary answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) on 23 December last, showed that on 30 June 1980, 796 prisoners under 21 had been reclassified as adults, and an additional 63 prisoners over 21 on that date had been reclassified as adults when they were under 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister will accept that those figures are rather high and slightly disturbing. They show what has been happening within the young offender institutions. They certainly give much credence to the suspicions and fears of the Magistrates Association and others, who believe that the Prison Department has been involved in an administrative procedure which helps to make their lives more convenient and acceptable, but is not necessarily in the best interests of the young offenders concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree with the statement of the Magistrates Association that this power is currently being used far more than is necessary? Does he accept that it is being used because of the overcrowding in the Prison Department as a whole? Will he consider the Magistrates Association suggestion that these powers should be further limited
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
so that they cannot be abused in the way in which they are currently abused?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause enables an offender sentenced to youth custody to be treated as if he had been sentenced to imprisonment in one of two circumstances, either if he has reached the age of 21, or if he has reached the age of 18 and is a bad influence or disruptive while in custody. We are concerned in this debate with the second reason. At present, prisoners aged 18 or over may be reclassified as adults either because their character or level of sophistication would have an undesirable effect on other young prisoners, or on general grounds of personality. That is the present position which is a good deal more indefinitely and widely drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure is purely administrative, because there is no difference in law between young and adult prisoners. There is also statutory provision for a borstal trainee to have his sentence commuted to imprisonment, if he is reported to the Secretary of State by the board of visitors to be incorrigible or to be exercising a bad influence on other inmates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 11 makes roughly similar provision for those who attain the age of 21 during the currency of a youth custody sentence, to be treated as if they had been sentenced to imprisonment. It also replaces the present measures for dealing with disruptive young offenders. The emphasis is placed not so much on the reprehensibility of the offender's conduct as on the detrimental effect on others. These offenders, too, can be treated as if they had been sentenced to imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that can properly be made in answer to the anxiety expressed by the hon. Gentleman and the Magistrates' Association is that the restriction placed upon this power in this clause of the Bill is more narrowly drawn than that which affects the power under the present statute. We have deliberately restricted the new power of conversion. The offender must be a bad influence or disruptive while in custody. This is a good deal more tightly and narrowly expressed than the present provision which speaks of general grounds of personality. Were we to continue with the present widely drawn power, there would be a risk that with continuing pressures on the prison population the numbers would increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To save me making a mini-speech later, can I just ask the Minister whether he accepts that the fears expressed by the Magistrates' Association about the existing system have some basis and that there is evidence that youngsters have been reclassified to relieve pressure on space rather than for sound reasons of disruption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not agree with that, but v/ill accept that if the pressure on places remains high—we hope that it will diminish—the broader power under the existing law would create a risk that reclassification might be carried out to relieve the pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a risk. I am not saying that that has occurred, but there is a risk. Therefore, it should
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
be welcomed that clause 11 is more tightly expressed and that the focus is exclusively upon the detrimental effect on others in the establishment housing the young offender. I think that is sufficient to answer satisfactorily the points that have been made. Perhaps we may now agree clause 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 12, line 12, leave out from " (5A)" to end of line 20 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"paragraphs 	<i>(b)</i> and 	<i>(c)</i> shall be omitted ".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) In section 60(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> shall be omitted.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) In paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> of section 60(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, the words ' or to a person who was under the age of twenty-one when sentence was passed on him' shall be omitted.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can move the amendments briefly. Their purpose is to make the length of licence of young offenders released on parole the same as that for adults. That would mean that the licence would remain in force—that is, the licence for young offenders would remain in force until the day on which an offender would have been discharged from prison remission. This is the case for an adult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Probation Officers feels strongly that the present differentiation in the duration of parole licence should be ended. It has evidence that it gives rise to serious anomalies and, on occasions, has put young offenders in a worse position than adult offenders. If a licence is revoked, the offender is liable to serve the unexpired period of the licence in custody. Because a licence for a young offender can extend beyond the remission date, while an adult licence ends at the remission date, the young offender could serve longer in custody than an adult serving an identical length sentence. That is difficult to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument—I do net use it as the main argument—is that as the treatment of young offenders under the parole system is otherwise the same as that of adults, there is no clear reason why the length of licence should be different. The young offender should not be put at a disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hen. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson). For the fourth time, I wish to commend what the Government are doing and to congratulate them yet again on having initiated a useful reform in line with the arguments that have been advanced by both the National Association of Probation Officers and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
chief conference of probation officers. My hon. and learned Friend is trying to ensure that the logic of the Governments position is extended and that their proposals in the Bill will be taken further still.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one point. If young offenders are subject to longer licence periods, it puts them in a worse position than adult offenders in two respects, bearing in mind that it is possible for a parole licence to be revoked, and the offender is then liable to serve the unexpired portion of the licence in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the young offenders' licences are no longer those of an adult, and the young offender is at risk of recall to custody for breach of the conditions of his licence for some time after an adult's licence would have expired. Secondly, if recalled, the young offender is liable to serve the unexpired part of his licence in custody, which means that he is liable to serve a longer term in custody than an adult whose length of licence is shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a manifest injustice, for which there is no obvious rationale or justification, especially as all the other strong arguments, such as shorter periods of supervision, that are likely to be more effective, are generally accepted by the Court. I hope that the Minister will feel able to go a long way towards accepting both the arguments advanced by my hon. and learned Friend and myself and the amendment tabled by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what has been said by the hon. Member for Ormskirk about his pleasure at the way in which the Government have moved in this regard, and I fully understand the concerns that have motivated the amendment moved by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson). I appreciated the brief and fair way in which he moved it. All offenders released from custody under the age of 22 will be under supervision. Young offenders serving sentences of youth custody will be eligible for earlier release on parole licence, in the same way as young prisoners are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause amends the existing provision in section 60 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, which deals with the duration of licences granted to young offenders, so that it fits in with the arrangements in clause 14 for the supervision of young offenders released otherwise than on licence. As with an adult, a parole licence cannot end before the remission date. Subject to that, a young offenders' parole licence runs to the end of 12 months from the date of release, or until his 22nd birthday, whichever is the earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendments would be that young offenders released on parole would be treated in exactly the same way as adults released on parole. I say at once that I can quite see the attractions of that argument. They v/ere made clear by the hon. and learned Gentleman. The difficulty is, however, that if the amendments were to succeed, young offenders released on parole would be treated in a quite different way from young offenders released under supervision in the ordinary way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
It seems to us better on the whole to try to maintain a kind of equality of treatment between young offenders as a class, than to ensure parity between adults on the one hand and young offenders on the other. All young offenders will be supervised on release. It is an integral part of the sentence for a young offender, and it is important that a period in custody should be followed by a period of supervision in the community. It must not be too long, otherwise it becomes unrealistic. We think that we have the duration about right. That is clearly necessary, and indeed, can often be of great help to the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 provides that young offenders will be supervised for roughly the final third of their whole sentence. There is an overall maximum of 12 months, and an overall minimum of three months. These represent the limits during which it is thought that a period of supervision can realistically be maintained. The limits will mean that in some cases offenders are supervised beyond the expiration of their sentences, and that in some cases the period of supervision will expire before the sentence would have done. There is a general cut-off point at the 22nd birthday, which applies also to the parole provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point the Minister is making, that for a large number of young people the provisions of the clause will mean that they have shorter periods under licence than they would otherwise have had. But as he has rightly pointed out, some will have longer periods under licence- Does he not accept that the whole purpose of supervising in the community is, presumably, in some way to reintegrate them back into the community? That requires trust between the supervising officer and the young offender—that they must work together amicably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that can destroy that relationship is a feeling on the part of the young offender that he is being treated unfairly and unjustly. The feeling that he is being supervised for longer than would be the case if he were an adult, will generate within him a resentment and an opposition that will in no way help him to be properly supervised and make a success of the attempt to bring him back into the community. Does not the hon. and learned Gentleman acknowledge that that is a real fear of what may happen, apart from all the other arguments about the injustice of actually expecting a young offender to accept, in a docile and complacent fashion, a longer period under supervision than would have been the case had it been an adult convicted, perhaps, of a far more serious offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the argument, but I think that it is overstated. After all, supervision is intended to be of help to the young offender. As I said just now, we think it important that its duration should be limited to what is likely to be of practical help, and we think that we have the duration about right here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that there may be a feeling of being unfairly discriminated against in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman describes, but against that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
one has to weigh a similar feeling that might well arise, as I have said, in circumstances in which young offenders released on parole would be treated in quite different way from young offenders released under supervision in the ordinary way. One might well look at the other side of the coin and say, " I have been discriminated against, because I am being treated adversely here compared with a young man who benefits from the system that would pertain if the amendments were to succeed."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, it seems to us better on the whole to try to maintain a sort of equality of treatment as between young offenders as a class. Young people as a whole are strongly affected by the concept of equity, which they tend to regard as synonymous with equality, and the younger one is, the more likely one is to feel that it is unfair if one is treated adversely compared with somebody of the same age—another offender, for example, who had the advantage of gaining parole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendments would be that those offenders who had the advantage of being released early from custody on parole, before they had served two-thirds of the sentence, would have the additional and substantial advantage that they would only be supervised up to the two-thirds point of the sentence, the remission date. For the reasons I have tried to outline, it does not seem right that these offenders should be so highly favoured over those who are released in an ordinary way, with remission and supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is that a young offender would be liable to be recalled to custody beyond the two-thirds point of his sentence, when those who are released on supervision cannot be recalled, and are liable only to be sentenced under clause 14 for the offence of breach of supervision. I do not find that argument very persuasive. The offender released on parole has, after all, had less time in custody than he would usually have to serve. He has had that substantial advantage. He remains liable to be recalled, certainly, to serve that time, but the liability will run only until he reaches the age of 22, or until the remission date if that is later. Only in a few cases will it run until or beyond the date when a sentence expires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will clear up one point about which I am not absolutely certain, arising out of our debate on clause 11.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes it does. I should still like to delay my reply for the moment.

Perhaps I may be allowed to breach the rules of order a little later by doing so, rather than delay the Committee at the moment. So efficiently am I served that I am able not to have to be relied upon. I ask for that indulgence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 applies if the offender was under 21 when he was sentenced. This is not altogether an easy question, though I am clear where my preference lies. One is balancing one's sense of injustice against another. On the whole, as I think the hon. and learned Member for Accrington now acknowledges, there is more to be said than he had at first supposed for the scheme contained in our clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very willing to look again at what has been said in the debate, because I acknowledge that to some extent this depends upon a subjective evaluation of the arguments. I think it is inherent from what I have said, that there is no commitment on my part to change, but I would welcome the opportunity to read again what has been said and to reflect upon it.

I accept that that is a very difficult balance. It is a question of which side one comes down on in the end. I do not think I need labour the point. The Minister has explained it fully.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 14, line 24, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this amendment on behalf of the all-party Penal Affairs Group. This amendment would repeal the prohibition on making an attendance centre order on an offender who had previously served a custodial sentence. This was a recommendation of the all-party Penal Affairs Group in our report " To Many Prisoners " published in July 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
In general, I welcome the provisions of the Bill concerning attendance centres, particularly the extension to the Crown Court of the power to make attendance centre orders. Attendance centres provide a simple, straightforward and useful penalty that does not have the undesirable effect that we all wish to avoid, of incarcerating an individual in an institution. They are also extremely cheap to administer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average cost of an attendance centre order in 1979-80 was about £35. In 1980, Home Office research study No. 60 " Junior Attendance Centres " found that junior attendance centres:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…appear to be satisfactorily achieving t'.ie objectives set them by the courts, that they are used for a wide variety of offenders and that there are no contra-indications to their continued use for any particular type of boy. Their use might, indeed, be extended to some of those to whom the courts reluctantly award custodial penalties."</p></blockquote>
Although the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 envisaged the phasing out of attendance centres, in 1975, as the Committee will recall, the House of Commons Expenditure Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes) in its report on the 1969 Act recommended that the attendance centre system be retained and, indeed, extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our report " Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future" the all-party Penal Affairs Group supported this view. We recommended that the provision in the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 for the phasing out of attendance centres should be repealed. I am pleased to see that the Bill does, in fact, repeal that particular provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the present Government came into office they have adopted a very much more positive attitude towards the expansion of attendance centres than did the previous Labour Government. There is now a network of more than 100 junior attendance centres covering a great part of England and Wales. Before the present Government took office there were only two senior attendance centres for the 17 to 20 age group. I particularly welcome the fact that the Government have asked a number of chief constables to open senior attendance centres in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary has told the all-party Penal Affairs Group that the Government intend eventually to establish such centres in at least the main areas of population, subject to review in the light of experience with the current expansion. Although, I warmly welcome the Government's positive attitude towards attendance centres, I consider that they could be used far more flexibly, more effectively and more imaginatively by the courts, if the prohibition on using them for young people who have already served a custodial sentence were repealed. I regard that particular prohibition—that someone who has already served a custodial sentence cannot in future be given an attendance centre order—to be inappropriate and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That view is shared by the Magistrates' Association, which has said that the question of whether an attendance centre order would be appropriate in
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
a particular case for an offender who has previously served a custodial sentence, should be left to the discretion of the courts. Those are magic words which I hope will have the right response from Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will not be tuned in to' the nuances of what is going on here, Mr. Watkins, but I want the Government to follow me in giving the courts a greater area of discretion than they have currently at their disposal. This proposal is shared and endorsed by the Magistrates' Association. The Government have frequently stressed the view that the courts should be given greater flexibility in sentencing. I therefore expect the Minister to welcome this particular amendment, especially as the removal of this fetter on the courts would help them to use attendance centres more often as a genuine alternative to- custody than they are able to at the moment. As the Association of Metropolitan Authorities pointed out in its comments on the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group report "Young Offenders—a Strategy for the Future ", and I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there must be considerable doubt about the extent to which attendance centres are used as an alternative to residential or custodial measures for juveniles. Most courts appear to place attendance centres between a fine and supervision in their tariff of penalties."</p></blockquote>
The principal argument which traditionally has been advanced against making attendance centre orders on those who have previously served custodial sentences is that they might contaminate the less hardened, the less delinquent offenders who are attending the centres. I do not accept that argument. I do not believe that it is a sufficiently strong or powerful enough argument to prohibit the courts from making such an order on those who have previously had a custodial experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hardly likely that the courts would sentence to a detention centre somebody whose background was such that he was likely to contaminate others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I welcome the hon. and learned Gentleman's support for the point that I am making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the courts will be able to make a detention centre order for as little as three weeks. At present, the majority of juvenile offenders sent to detention centres have two or fewer previous convictions. Can the Minister seriously suggest that there are no circumstances in which a court could reasonably decide that a young offender who was up before the court for a second or perhaps even a third offence, and who had served a custodial sentence of three weeks—with remission, only two weeks—in a detention centre, should receive an attendance centre order? I do not believe that such an offender is inevitably so hardened by what will now be a new shorter two-week experience in a detention centre that the court would feel prohibited from imposing an attendance centre order. Indeed, he might consider in the particular circumstances of the new offence that that is the most desirable option. In that case, I would like that option to be at the disposal of the courts in a way that it is not at the moment. I hope that the Minister will be able to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
accept the amendment. If he cannot, perhaps at the least he will agree to amend the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support to some degree what the hon. Gentleman is saying. It would strengthen his case a great deal more if the courts considered the detention centre in the light of an earlier offence rather than merely as a last resort, as they have been doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that both can apply. If an offender has served a custodial sentence, an attendance centre order, however appropriate it is to that offender for the new specific offence, cannot be given. I regard that as an unnecessary fetter on the court's power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. If he cannot accept it, perhaps at the least he will agree to amend the Bill to allow the courts to make attendance centre orders on such offenders if special circumstances related either to the offender or to the offence justify this course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to ask the Minister if he would be ready to consider this amendment. I understand that he may be. I can see that when someone has been sentenced to a detention centre some months or a year before, and is in some scrape the attendance centre, which is a positive kind of penalty, would be appropriate. It seems a pity that it should be automatically ruled out. I go further. It would be a pity if such a young person were then sent for some form of residential care which could have been avoided if he had been kept at home with the beneficial training available at an attendance centre. I hope that the Minister will at least make that degree of amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and urge the Minister to consider it sympathetically. I should like to put one additional argument. An offender, having previously served in a detention centre, may be in trouble again for an entirely different offence. In those circumstances it would be inappropriate to have to put him in custody when the offence itself would not normally merit such a sentence and, indeed, when the offender's record suggests that he has made a determined effort to improve since his last time in custody. The offence which brings him before the court may be an aberration but the court is obliged to put him in custody although it may not wish to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's amendment in its full width. I do not ask for reservations in the Minister's reply or for any assurance which is limited to detention centres. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) has made the valid point that one may be faced with a totally different type of case than that on which the young offender was previously sentenced, to one of the other types of custodial sentence referred to in subsection (3). The provisions of clause 16 can be used, among other things, for default in
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
payment of a sum of money or failure in some other direction which arises out of a probation order for instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the earlier provisions of the Bill, the court is required not to pass a custodial sentence on a young person if there is any other way of dealing with him. The subsection would remove ways of dealing with him which might be perfectly proper in the circumstances, thus forcing the court to pass a custodial sentence on him, notwithstanding that it may be inappropriate or unnecessary. I hope that the Minister will view the amendment favourably. I sense that it is supported on the Government benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been helpful. It was marked by unanimity. I shall say a word of introduction about detention centres and then see to what conclusion the nuances of the debate have pointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause re-enacts, with some amendments, the provisions of the 1948 and 1961 Acts which empower magistrates' courts to impose attendance centre orders on offenders under 21 and on persons under 21 who failed to comply with the requirements of a probation or supervision order. But there is a significant change. We propose that the Crown court should have power to make an attendance centre order on conviction or for breach of a probation order made by the Crown court. It has always been rather surprising to me that the Crown court does not have power to make an attendance centre order in respect of somebody who has been convicted at the Crown court on appeal or commital from a magistrates' court. We are putting that right, and I think that is a sensible measure. The change will increase the range of non-custodial sentences available to the Crown court when dealing with young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What lies behind the exclusion of those who have previously served a custodial sentence is that these are simple establishments, in nearly every case run by police officers in their spare time, under the direction of chief constables acting as agents for the Home Secretary. They are run for periods of two hours or so in an afternoon, perhaps in a gymnasium or a local hall and broadly speaking they are not geared to cope with hardened young criminals. It is important that we do not prejudice the undoubted success of these attendance centres, or make more difficult the task of dedicated police officers and others who staff them by introducing to the attendance centres people who are too tough to be coped with. That is the reason behind the exclusion in the existing statutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must take note of what has been urged upon me, not only by the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) but by the all-party penal affairs group which gave perceptive attention to this and other subjects. I also note what has been said by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell), and I accept that there may be circumstances in which somebody, notwithstanding that he has had a custodial sentence, would be a suitable candidate for an attendance centre order.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
Generally speaking, I think that the rule should remain as it is, but I accept that there may have been exceptional, or at any rate different circumstances from those of the offence now to be dealt with, which in the past led to a short custodial sentence. That should not write the offender off as unsuitable for an attendance centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am influenced by what has been said. There is probably a way of expressing this thought, perhaps through the concept of special circumstances or special reasons. I emphasise that the genera] rule must remain, but I give an undertaking to look with care and sympathy at the possibility of giving guidance to courts, so that they will realise that while the general rule must be as I have stated, there may be special circumstances which warrant a departure from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is keeping the Committee in quiet suspense so far, and I am grateful for what he has said. If the prohibition remains in the Bill he cannot give the kind of guidance to the courts that he suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping to make it clear that the prohibition would be qualified. I was hoping that we could find a way of qualifying it by having an exception which would apply in special circumstances. If that would be enough to satisfy the hon. Member for Ormskirk I hope that we may be able to proceed. These are extremely important institutions. We have greatly enlarged the numbers, and I am grateful for what the hon. Member has said about the attitude that this Government have taken to attendance centres which is more positive than that of the Labour Government. I never really understood why that Government were apparently reluctant to build upon their success; I am pleased to say that since we took office 33 new attendance centres have been opened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain why? The actual decision to extend attendance centres to junior attendance centres was taken in my time. There was a specific allocation of money, we began the process, and this Government have built on it. Unlike my hon. Friend, I at least pay tribute to some of the things done by the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to acknowledge what my predecessor in office was able to do in this regard. I am glad that we have extended it, especially for senior attendance centres. There were only two of them, there are now seven, and more are planned. That is our approach to the matter. I am persuaded, at least in part, by what has been said. I end with that expression of the Government's attitude. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn so that we can make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon), I give credit where credit is due. Unfortunately—and it is a matter of great regret—not much penal reform was introduced by the Labour Government. That is unfortunate,
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
but true. I am grateful for what the Minister has said and for the assurances that he has given. On the understanding that we shall return to this point on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REQUIREMENTS IN SUPERVISION ORDERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 19, line 42, leave out paragraph 	<i>(b)</i>.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to move the amendment briefly, although it is an important amendment. The reasoning behind it is simple. By deleting paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> a provision would be deleted from the Bill that empowers the courts to require juveniles to refrain from specified activities. I accept that that is something that the Government have for the first time specifically included in a criminal justice Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several reasons why that deletion is desirable. I accept that in most circumstances magistrates using such a power—that is, the power to require juveniles not to indulge in certain activities—would consider matters carefully and would exercise care and restraint. However, occasionally there is a danger that such restraint might not be used and that unreasonable restrictions could be placed on a young person—restrictions that would bear little relationship to the nature of the offence for which he had been convicted or to his behaviour. It is always easy for a supervisor, or someone carrying out a supervision order, to check whether a juvenile has engaged in a specific activity. He can carry out simple investigations to find out whether a juvenile attended a particular activity. It is difficult—indeed, it borders on the impossible—for him effectively to monitor whether a juvenile has refrained from carrying out a particular activity. The obvious example that springs to the minds of the Committee is that of attendance at football matches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, some activities are impossible to supervise and some negative orders cannot be enforced. But there are many which can easily be enforced, such as an order not to attend a certain cafe or amusement arcade. That could easily be checked upon, that might be necessary in the supervision of a young person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, some activities could be checked more easily than others—but there are some that it would be impossible for the supervisor effectively to check upon. One is non-attendance at a football match. It would be impossible for the supervisor to find out, other than by asking the offender, whether he has attended perhaps one of 10 league football matches in a particular area. In those circumstances, the authority of the court, of the supervisor himself and of the supervision order
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
could be substantially undermined in the eyes of the juvenile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of a football match it would be far better and more effective for the supervisor to engage the youngster in alternative activities. That could lead to preparing him for the normal juvenile activity of attending a football match, and is surely better than banning him from football matches. One method would be to involve the juvenile, the supervisor and perhaps a trusted adult in a scheme under which the youngster could go to the football match with the trusted adult. As a result, he would behave himself all the better and, for the rest of his life, could join in what is a common and normal activity for youngsters, and enjoy a football match without indulging in violence or bad behaviour. I have put the case very simply. It is a simple argument and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) says that he puts the case very simply but, as always, he puts it clearly. It is a simple case, which I understand. He has, however, not given due weight to the safeguards written into the clause to ensure that no negative requirement would be imposed in an unreasonable case. That is the word that the hon. and learned Gentleman used. I ruefully acknowledge that the clause is grist to the mill of the right hon. and learned Member for Dul-wich (Mr. Silkin) in his campaign for slightly more pellucid drafting. I do not say that by way of criticism of the parliamentary draftsmen. In new subsection (3E) at line 10, we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court may not include requirements under subsection (3C) of this section—</p></blockquote>
that means that it cannot do what we are talking about—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a supervision order unless—
	<ol>
	<li>it has first consulted the supervisor;</li>
	<li>having regard to the circumstances of the case, it considers the requirements necessary for securing the good conduct of the supervised person or for preventing a repetition by him of the same offence or the commission of other offences; and</li>
	<li>the supervised person or, if he is a child, his parent or guardian, consents to their inclusion."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is a pretty effective trio of qualifications to the exercise of this power. I see what the hon. and learned Gentleman has in mind. We do not want to prejudice the chances of success of a supervision order by attaching to it a negative condition—"you shan't go here, you shan't do that"—if the youngster concerned is likely to feel that those are unreasonable and a source of proper resentment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, the supervising officer must be consulted. It is a pretty unlikely circumstance that a court, having consulted the supervising officer, none-the less goes ahead and makes a supervision order with a condition of which that officer, when consulted, has disapproved. If there is a real chance of a conflict of opinion between the two, is it really very likely that the court will make a supervision order at all if it would be supervised by somebody in conflict in a serious way with what the court had in mind? That is the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
The second point is that the court is specifically directed to consider whether it is necessary to secure the good conduct of the youngster, or to prevent a repetition by him. Thirdly, and not the least important, he must either give his consent himself or, if he is a child, his parent has to give consent. So I believe that all that adds up to a pretty reassuring package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that to disregard the anxieties that have been expressed in certain quarters, but I think that a negative requirement can be of use in certain circumstances. There are certain precedents for provisions of this kind. Parole licences, for example, sometimes include negative requirements and care is taken to make sure first, that they are enforceable in the sense that a breach is identifiable and unequivocal and, secondly, that every breach which is detected will be enforced. I think that some value is to be gained from that precedent of the parole licence not altogether different in character. It has been found to be valuable to have this power in certain circumstances to put in a negative requirement to a parole licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is not the supervisor's job to police an offender's every move, nor could he do so. A supervisor cannot necessarily personally ensure that the juvenile never does what he is supposed not to do. His role is rather to make sure that the offender understands his obligations under the order to which he has already consented—either himself or through his parent or guardian—and the consequences of a breach. Generally, he will advise, assist and befriend—if I remember accurately—the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, it is discovered that the offender has attended a football match, for example, when he has been told not to, there is no question but that he is in breach and can be brought to court and punished for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This measure builds on an existing provision in the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, section 12(3)	<i>(b)</i>. That provision which was modelled on the probation order was inserted in 1977. It allows a court already to impose negative requirements on a juvenile offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that it allows those negative requirements to be imposed without any of the safeguards in this provision in the Bill. We have no evidence that that has caused any difficulty. Having drawn the Committee's attention to this trio of qualifications in clause 19, and also to the fact that this is a constriction of a power already included since 1977 in the Children and Young Persons Act, I believe that the Committee may be satisfied that there is not only virtue in the power to include a negative order, as has been demonstrated in parole licences, but that the restrictions imposed upon that power in the Bill are sufficient to meet the reasonable anxieties expressed by the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister has said, but I am a little troubled by the expression
	<br><blockquote><p>"refrain from participating in activities".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
It parallels the provision in subsection (2), which is in the positive form. One can understand a requirement to participate in certain activities. That is very clear. When one gets the negative, the Minister can most help the Committee on the question whether it would include, for example, to refrain from consorting with a particular person or persons? That might be an important aspect of supervision, supervision, although somehow it does not seem to fit the words " participating in activities ". I do not know whether there is any authority on that, but perhaps the Minister can help us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that participating in activities, in its most natural sense and most immediate connotation, relates to a broad activity, such as going to a football match. But it can also be applied, without violating the language, to a much narrower focus, such as going to a cafe, and thence to consorting with an individual. I shall consider that point. I acknowledge that there may be circumstances in which it would be sensible to impose a negative condition—for example, " You shall not consort with X or Y." I believe that, at first flush, the language is sufficiently wide, but I want to consider that. I am grateful that the point has been raised, and will take whatever necessary steps if the language is insufficiently wide at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one wanted to prevent somebody truanting from school, and that was one of the problems associated with a supervision order, would not the power to require him to present himself to somebody, possibly even at the school, to show that
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
he was there at a particular time be helpful? Although that might seem to be negative, if it ensured his continued attendance and overcame that problem it might be extremely positive. If the paragraph were removed, that power would be lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that may well be right. I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend about the desirability of ensuring attendance at a certain time or a certain place, and especially in the circumstances that he put forward. I am grateful for that intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having given myself such a hostage to fortune earlier when I said that all my inclinations were to accept the arguments of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), unless there was overwhelming evidence to the contrary, how can I possibly do anything other than withdraw the amendment Before I do so, however, I wish to say that I was interested to hear the Minister say, in effect, that he did not conceive the role of the supervisor as being that of a policeman. That is what some supervisors feel is the danger in the clause—the juvenile, whose relationship with the supervisor depends upon trust, might see him in a different role. However, with the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
