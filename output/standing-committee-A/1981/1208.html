</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Iain Sproat)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the previous sitting, my hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) and Luton, East (Mr. Bright), and in an intervention my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins), raised strongly the important question of the privatisation of the British Airports Authority. I was struck by the constructive and open-minded way in which they did so and by the fact that they urged on the Government totally new possible ways of organising and funding the British Airports Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, I am strictly constrained in what I can say to the Committee by a number of factors, of which the most obvious is the current process of litigation over user charges, under which not only is the British Airports Authority being sued but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is being named. In those circumstances, I ask for the fore-bearance of my hon. Friends and of the Committee as a whole if I restrict myself to only two comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, my right hon. Friend said as much as he felt appropriate on the matter in the Second Reading debate at column 42 in 	<i>Hansard.</i> Secondly, I shall study with the greatest attention the novel, important and constructive proposals put forward in Committee by my hon. Friends on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) and Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) spoke properly of their concern about Prestwick airport and the fact that it was a British Airports Authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
airport. They know already that I am 100 per cent, behind them in their campaign to do everything that is reasonable, practical and feasible for the thriving and continuing prosperity of Prestwick. I urge them in all non-partisan sincerity, while they and my hon. Friends properly pursue that legitimate aim, that they should do so in a manner that bears some relation to reality. I do not say this in a strong sense of criticism, but the hon. Member for South Ayrshire claimed in his interesting speech that somehow there was a bias against Prestwick and Scotland because so much that we and the British Airports Authority discussed was related to the South-East of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So much money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So much money and so much attention had been paid to the South-East. As my hon. Friends will readily remind us, every year some 360,000 passengers go through Prestwick and some 36 million passengers go through the airports in the South-East of England. The balance of attention, funding and our speeches must properly be guided by the variance between those two statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, of course I appreciate the importance of Prestwick. I give a total assurance to the Opposition that I shall do everything in my power to make certain that Prestwick continues, as far as is practical and reasonable, to be a thriving and prosperous airport for the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the statistics that the Minister has put forward, but does he not accept that it is also part of our case that a percentage of the traffic that currently goes through the South-East airports could be diverted to Prestwick and other Scottish and provincial airports? As well as redirecting attention and finance, we should also redirect many of the aircraft. The routes out of Prestwick and out of Scotland should be encouraged and developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to that question is " No ". I do not believe that passengers should be compelled to go through airports that are far out of their way. I am not talking just on behalf of Conservative Members, but I remind the hon. Gentleman that Labour's White Paper of 1978 stated specifically that one could not say to someone who wanted to do a business deal in London that from Paris Charles de Gaulle he would be flown to Prestwick and could then make his way down to London. That is unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I meant transatlantic flights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same applies. For example, if people want to go to Prestwick, it is open to them to do so, but it would be wrong for the Government to try to impose upon passengers a pattern of travel that did not suit their immediate needs. I beg the hon. Gentleman not to pursue that. If he wants Prestwick to be considered realistically and if he wants to win support for it, which I am sure many hon. Members in the Committee and in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
the House would like to give generally, he does not better his case by putting forward such arguments for Prestwick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Wavertree)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that my hon. Friend says " Hear, hear ". He knows the problem in Liverpool. The argument is the same. Once we say that people must go to Liverpool or Prestwick and not Heathrow or Gatwick, we are a long way down a slippery slope. However, I appreciate the proper concern expressed by the hon. Members for South Ayrshire and Central Ayrshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that subject, will he comment on the specific point that I raised about transport between Prestwick railway station and Prestwick airport? That has been a cause of great concern for some time. As the Minister knows, the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) raised that subject en a number of occasions when he was a Back Bencher. That is one cf the factors that discourage passengers from using Prestwick airport and the rail link. Will the Minister undertake to consider that matter or to ask the British Airports Authority to consider it seriously, so that the link between the station and the airport can be improved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give that assurance. I shall be seeing the chairman of the British Airports Authority this evening. I shall seek to discuss that matter with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is seeing the chairman of the British Airports Authority this evening. The managing director of the British Airports Authority has written to hon. Members. He says that although he does not like writing to hon. Members, he is concerned about a number of matters that have been aired in the Committee, particularly in relation to landing charges. This may not be a convenient time to raise the matter, but will the Minister have a word with the chairman about the letter from the managing director? The figures in the letter suggest that increases of about 12 per cent, to 13 per cent, will be made by the British Airports Authority, which are high. They are not nearly as high as British Airways suggested. Their figure was around 17 per cent. However, it is an astronomical increase and a matter that will give concern to both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond directly to the point made by my hon. Friend. I have not seen the letter. Either it has not arrived yet or Mr. Mulkern did not send me a copy. If my hon. Friend will give me the letter after this sitting, I shall study it before speaking to Mr. Payne this evening. No doubt I shall speak to Mr. Mulkern this evening, and I shall express the concern of my hon. Friends in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar made an extremely constructive speech. I wish to associate myself with the kindly remarks that he made at the beginning about the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Hackney Central (Mr. Davis). I think that all sides appreciate the way in which he looked after the interests of aviation for so long, and I certainly wish to be associated with the compliment that my hon. Friend paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken careful note of the points that my hon. Friend made about the different ways of funding the British Airports Authority, but perhaps he will apply my earlier caveat to the whole of his speech in as much as it referred to the privatisation of British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made a valid point about security charges. I have considered the matter and have decided to reduce the security charges from £1-50 to £1-20 for a six-month period to give some relief to the airlines. The charges will then revert to £1-50, but I hope that the reduction will give the airlines an interim breathing space.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish not to say how pleased I am that, in response to a humble Back Bench contribution in Committee, the Minister has made such an important announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to remember, however, that I coupled my remarks about the cost of the security levy with the suggestion that it might be reduced still further if the service were either returned to the airlines or put out to private enterprise. I appreciate that he cannot say too much about privatisation of the British Airports Authority generally, but there is nothing to prevent him reacting to my suggestions about the security levy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, there is not, and I am happy to do so. I can tell my hon. Friend immediately that I have decided to look at that matter again as well. I must tell him, however, that some people are worried about building up what they describe as private armies of security personnel. Nevertheless, I have decided to look again at the ways in which other countries deal with these matters, and particularly at the experience in America where the individual airlines are responsible for their own security personnel. I shall certainly discuss the matter with the British Airports Authority and with British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the remarks of the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie). I think that I dealt with his main point when I referred to the speech of his hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). The hon. Gentleman asked whether the increase took into account the situation at Prestwick, the closing of British Airways operations and possible future operations by Laker and North-West Orient. The simple answer to that question is " Yes, they do."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that insufficient information was given in the British Airports Authority's annual report. I share his feelings about the opaqueness of most financial reports. On this occasion, however, I must tell him that the financial report of the British Airports Authority received the supreme accolade of being judged the clearest set of financial reports of almost any public sector body
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
last year. Therefore, although it is always difficult to follow these matters, the British Airports Authority must be given credit for attempting to set them out as clearly as is possible in such a complicated area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to monitoring the British Airports Authority's performance in comparison with foreign airports, I think that I covered that point last week in my comments about the difficulties of making fair comparisons. The fact that a task is difficult, however, does not mean that it should not be attempted, and we are doing precisely that. Once again, however, I ask the hon. Gentleman's forbearance if I do not go into great detail, as user charges lie at the heart of the current litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lambie	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Central Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this context, I draw the Minister's attention to the guidelines issued by British Airways as compared with a statement in the letter received by hon. Members from the British Airports Authority. It is difficult to evaluate charges and to make comparisons with foreign airports if one cannot obtain vertification of what is happening in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Airways guidelines state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"British Airways' total bill from the BAA would be likely to increase from £52 million to more than £60 million (16 per cent.) in a full year. British Airways' revenue, on the other hand, is increasing at only about half that rate."</p></blockquote>
Dealing with the same question, paragraph 3 of the British Airports Authority letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"British Airways' total traffic charges with the BAA will not rise from £52 million to £60 million (16 per cent.) in a full year. The correct figure would be from about £47 million to £53 million, i.e. 13 per cent, excluding DoT security costs."</p></blockquote>
Two nationalised concerns are therefore dealing with the same sums—one paying and the other receiving them—but neither knows the correct figures. Will the Minister deal with that? How can we evaluate the position at Atlanta, John F. Kennedy or Paris airports if we do not know what is happening in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I have not seen the letter from Mr. Mulkern, but when I do so I shall compare the figures and tell the hon. Gentleman in detail how the two sets of figures may be reconciled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to respond to two points made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin). First, in regard to the National Car Parks facilities at Glasgow airport, I have ensured that that part of his speech was brought specifically to the attention of the chairman of the British Airports Authority. I wished to ensure that his comments reached the board before its meeting this morning, and that has been done, I shall be speaking to the chairman about it this evening and I hope that a suitable opportunity will arise to discuss it even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point related to baggage handling. I doubt whether there is a member of the Committee who has not at some time been deeply irritated by the fact that it may
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
take almost as long for baggage to travel from the aircraft to the carousel as for passengers to travel from one airport to the other. It is an extremely vexed question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) was right to make the distinction between the responsibility of the airline and that of the airport. In fact, it is the responsibility of the airline to convey bags from the plane to the carousel. As a general rule, if they are late, the airline is at fault. That is not always so, of course. If the conveyer belt breaks down or the carousel is not working, it is the fault of the British Airports Authority, but in general, baggage handling is the responsibility of the airline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an extremely interesting speech, and I thought that that point deserved further consideration. I therefore asked the British Airports Authority to provide the Committee with details of the performance of all the various airlines. A document is now available in the Committee Room showing how the various airlines performed in relation to the British Airports Authority performance criteria. The performance criteria are as follows. The authority allows 20 minutes from the touchdown of the aircraft to the appearance of a piece of baggage on the carousel. If the airline takes more than 20 minutes, that counts against it in that it has not fulfilled the performance criteria. If it takes less than 20 minutes, it has exceeded them. I am sure that the Committee will be most interested to see which airlines have excellent records and which have poor records. They will also be interested to see that the record of British Airways differs between Heathrow and Gatwick, so it is not just a matter of the airlines concerned—many other factors are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said and the papers provided will satisfy the hon. Gentleman. I thank him on behalf of the Committee for raising that important topic and enabling us to clarify a matter which deeply irritates many travellers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is grateful for the prompt attention that my hon. Friend the Minister has given to the matter and for the efficient way in which he has produced the figures at such short notice. I do not know whether there will be another sitting of the Committee—I imagine that if I continue intervening we may well have one—but if so, I wonder whether the Minister can give similar figures for car parking charges? It is an important matter, not just for Prestwick, but for London and Gatwick, where the cost of the 24-hour service is now approaching £8-40 or £9. When the Minister meets the chairman of the British Airports Authority will he ask him, in view of the fact that there are to be increases in landing charges of 12 per cent, and 17 per cent., to undertake that he will not permit that sort of increase in car parking charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can respond directly to my hon. Friend's intervention by saying that I shall seek to get from the chairman of the British Airports Authority a statement of policy on car parking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
charges, which I agree are important. However, even at this stage, I can tell my hon. Friend that one of the major problems of London Heathrow is the volume of cars. I believe that I am right in saying that in spite of the new London Underground service, which is faster and more convenient than the old bus service, the number of passengers coming to Heathrow by public transport and private cars remains the same. If hon. Members study a map of Heathrow or think about the last time that they went there, they will recall that all cars enter the airport by way of a tunnel into a round pool at the far end. Pressure on that pool in the middle of the terminal is intense. The British Airports Authority deliberately uses its car parking charges as an attempt to discourage people from bringing their private cars into the airport. Whether it is right or wrong to do that is a policy matter for the Authority. Anyone who has seen the traffic at Heathrow on an August morning or afternoon can appreciate why the authority does that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said that we must keep a close eye on monopolies' and nationalised industries' finances. I do not think that any Conservative Member will disagree with that, and I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall do everything in my power to follow his instructions on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright) made a powerful speech about privatisation. I hope that for the moment he will accept my opening remarks as an answer, and I assure him that I shall study his comments closely. I certainly endorse his remarks about the excellence of Luton airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having explained some of the reasons why I believe that it is essential that the British Airports Authority makes these limited increases, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. K. J. Woolmer	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Batley and Morley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up a few of the points made by the Under-Secretary of State, but, first, may I respectfully suggest, Mr. Mitchell, that we regard this matter as dealing with clause stand part, too, so that we can make the progress that we should all like to make?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman may make certain assumptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to make good an omission from my original remarks and convey my congratulations to the Under-Secretary of State on his debut as the Minister in charge of a Bill. He was extremely generous in his remarks to me, and I should like to reciprocate that and say how considerate he has been to me so far—but by omission rather than commission. I want to press him on some of the matters that I believe he could have clarified further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State will not be surprised if we recognise none of the virtues in the remarks about privatisation made by his hon. Friends, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
so appealed to him. The more we heard, the more convinced we were that they were pursuing the same sort of folly that led the previous Secretary of State to proceed with the attempt to privatise British Aerospace. It is interesting that the Government have no mandate from the electorate for that sort of proposal, although I realise that that did not stop them proposing to privatise British Airways, for which there was no electoral mandate, either. There was no mandate to double VAT. There are another dirty dozen lies emblazoned on my mind. I almost wake up these days with that front page of the 	<i>Daily Mail</i> still imprinted on my mind from my dreams. I am sure that the matter will feature large in the forthcoming election that the electorate hope is not too far away. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) whispered—I thought extremely generously—"Prescriptions". I did not wish to add grief to the broken oromises on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Under-Secretary of State was cautious in his reply to his hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel) about Stan-sted and Heathrow. He has not so far mentioned the matter in Committee. I was fascinated by the interest that was given to the word "before". The Under-Secretary of State said that he would certainly not withdraw the word "before". He assured his hon. Friend that

the fifth terminal and its relationship to Stansted.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's views on the matter have been well known for a long time ".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 16 November 1981, Vol. 12, c. 86].</p></blockquote>
I took that to mean that the Under-Secretary of State might have the open mind which the Secretary of State declaimed was the feature of all good Conservative Ministers. I wonder whether the word "before" has any significance or whether it implies that there is an open mind on the matter in the light of how events unfold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I link that question with another about the Department's latest view on passenger growth figures and aircraft movement figures. Has that been altered in the light of the depth and widespread nature of the recession throughout the world? Many of us deplore the fact, but there are considerable signs that the recession will be with us in many parts of the world for some considerable time. If the United States economy continues on its present course, the recession will get deeper as well as longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State spoke last week about users paying for the use of assets and commodities. I recall that the hon. Gentleman said that the previous Labour Government enunciated that principle and that he was sure that Labour Members would still accept that the general approach was sound. That appears to be reasonable. Most people agree, however, that public transport in most parts of the world has a large element of subsidy, but in relation to the British Airports Authority I concur with that.

	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
That is not the same as agreeing to a six per cent, current cost accounting return. The need to pay for services does not go as far as that, and my point is—and I shall press the Under-Secretary of State again for an answer—is that to set a target and to adhere to it regardless of the depth of the depression poses a real danger. In order to achieve a rate of return when faced with a falling market, a paradoxical position could arise of prices being forced up causing an upward boost in the price level which the Government wished to keep down. That could make matters more difficult for the customer of the service. That is a pattern that we have seen in other industries in the last year or so as the Government's economic policies have pushed the country into depression. Will the Under-Secretary of State say what was the actual current cost accounting rate of return in 1980-81 and what the forecast is for the current year? We are now approaching the half-way mark of the current financial year, and there must be some idea of whether the British Airports Authority will come somewhere near this figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of paying for use is also not the same as a 100 per cent, self-financing capital investment or even a 75 per cent, self-financing capital investment. What is happening is—this was a point made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle)—that the present generation are paying not only for their current use but for use by future generations. I believe that there will be a measure of agreement across the Committee that there must be some room for discussion and movement on the balancing of the burden of generation payments. Obviously, the bigger the proportion of internal self-financing, the more the current users are paying not only for their own use but for the investment for future use. The notion cf borrowing in order to pay for the use of the assets as they are made use of is well established and practised by large areas of the economic system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Under-Secretary of State again to tell the Committee why it appears that a 70-75 per cent. self-financing ratio is aimed at. I do not suggest that it should be a great deal less or a little less, but why does the Under-Secretary of State aim at this figure? If the British Airports Authority is to achieve the six per cent. CCA return, it appears that they would have little difficulty in raising the finance externally. It is not a loss-making business and therefore unable to raise the finance. If this is an area where current users can have lower charges and a profitable business can go to the market and raise finance, surely this would enable investment to take place on sensible terms and would also help to keep down current charges to users. That case is widely put forward, and I believe that some of the Minister's thoughts should be made a little clearer to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was similar confusion in the other place not long ago when the Under-Secretary of State replying to a question about the proportion of in
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
vestment financed from revenue said that to suggest a bigger borrowing proportion
	<br><blockquote><p>"would mean a subsidy from public funds—which I cannot countenance."—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i></p></blockquote> 26 November 1981; Vol. 425, c. 851.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That answer cannot be correct. Will the Under-Secretary of State confirm that the reply given in the other place was a misunderstanding of the issues involved. If that was put on record, we would be able to appreciate the thinking behind the approach to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State spoke about the comparison of landing charges. I accept that it was difficult for him to go into much detail. He said that "comparisons are misleading."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that comparisons can be misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The Under-Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Comparisons are not odious, but merely misleading."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 3 December 1981, c. 35.]</p></blockquote>
Those were the words that the Under-Secretary of State used. Whether they are misleading or not, the six per cent, rate of return has an effect on landing charges. The Public Accounts Committee Report said that the effect of establishing these higher rates of return would be to increase the authority's charges. In paragraph 5, the report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department stated that the targets had been agreed in time to be reflected in BAA's 1980–81 operational planning and were responsible for the substantial increases in the Authority's charges effective from 1 April 1980."</p></blockquote>
Although comparisons may be odious, there is no doubt that, as a result of setting certain targets, substantial increases in charges took place. To imply that the six per cent, rate of return is irrelevant to the argument is unfair to the issues involved. Equally, it must be true that the setting of a 75 per cent, internal financing ratio must have an effect on the current level of charges. I suggest that, in the middle of a recession, a more modest expectation of rate of return would be sensible and on a profitable business a greater willingness to turn to the market for funds. If both those courses were followed, I believe that it would be possible to alleviate the increased charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the subject of performance criteria. We had an even more unsatisfactory response from the Minister on that subject. I put to the Under-Secretary of State three areas of performance criteria which were specifically dealt with in the Public Accounts Committee Report. I do not believe in over-emphasising one report rather than another, but if the Public Accounts Committee examines certain matters and makes specific recommendations, I believe that our Standing Committee should look carefully at those recommendations and see what progress can be made when the opportunity arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firstly, there were two performance criteria which had already been put into place in 1980. The Minister, when dealing with that matter at the end of his remarks on Thursday—I readily accept that owing to a shortage of time he could not go into that as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
deeply as he might wish—said precious little We do not know what was achieved in measurable terms in the first year of operation and what has been achieved so far. I assume that these criteria will have been laid down and will have been measured in quantifiable terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot hide behind the existing litigation as an excuse for not setting out the results. This must be a matter of fact. If the results have to be revealed in any case, the Committee has every right to know them. I should like the Minister to say what were the targets and what has been achieved in relation to the criteria that have been in place for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have been told that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the reduction in passenger traffic which has taken place over the last two years because of world recession has made it extremely difficult for the authority to live up to the standards that it had hoped to achieve ".—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 3 December 1981, c. 36].</p></blockquote>
I take this to mean that the authority has not achieved very much in terms of measured results. It is not the case that the authority has not been trying its best to try and improve productivity. The fact is that lower growth than expected in traffic means that productivity will fall below what otherwise might have been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is linked to the 6 per cent, rate of return, it shows that the rate of return that was hoped for cannot necessarily be achieved when targets are set before a recession occurs. The question that arises is whether performance criteria that are not as good as hoped imply that the 6 per cent, rate of return will not materialise. It seems to me that the Minister is asking the British Airports Authority to square a circle. If the productivity is not coming through in the way that had been hoped because of the recession, does that affect the rate of return? If so, are the Government willing to moderate their demands of the British Airports Authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6 of the Public Accounts Committee Report said that the Department was looking for other performance criteria.
	<br><blockquote><p>"particularly to reflect the interests of the consumer."</p></blockquote>
That part of the Public Account Committee Report has not produced any comment from the Minister. I should like to know what other criteria and performance measurements have been considered and whether any have been turned down because they were thought inappropriate or not practicable and those that he has in mind to have in their place. If the answer is " None, so far ", will he say why no progress has been made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another measurement of performance aims to which the Public Accounts Committee referred was a comparison of performance at international airports to which the Minister referred in his remarks. When did the Minister commission the study to examine the possibility of establishing suitable parameters to compare performance? Does the study have as its terms of reference not only the examination of the possibility of establishing parameters but also the production of performance criteria in relation to international airports? When does he expect
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
the study to report, and to whom will it report? Will it report to the British Airports Authority, jointly to the Minister and the Authority or to the Minister himself?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have dealt with matters that arise from the Minister's remarks. If the answers are those that the Committee is reasonably entided to expect, it will be the Opposition's intention to withdraw the amendments and to proceed immediately to conclude the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of my intervention is to emphasise to the Government the importance of selling assets at this time. Our economy is in dire straits. It is imperative that the borrowing requirement be diminished in order to reduce the need for extra taxation and to help reduce the pressure on interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not sufficiently emphasise last Thursday the role that Stansted can play. I feel that Stansted on its own could be sold off to an independent operator and a profit derived from the operations at Stansted. At present, the British Airports Authority loses £4 million a year at Stansted. However, the airport has great potential for trans-Atlantic charters, air cargoes and European inclusive tour and charter flights of the kind developed by Luton airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noteworthy that increasing scheduled operations are beginning from Stansted. Air-UK is starting a service to Amsterdam, with 12 return flights a week. It intends to operate scheduled services on the Stansted-Paris and Stansted-Brussels routes. Jersey-European Airways has announced a further scheduled service flying between Stansted, Liverpool and Dublin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that Stansted has great potential. I do not think that there is any necessity at this time, with air traffic so depressed, for the kind of developments envisaged by the British Airports Authority there. I wonder really why the authority spent £10 million in the last financial year to acquire land in the Stansted area. It must be emphasised once more how damaging to airlines is the policy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
pursued by the British Airports Authority whereby so much of its capital programme is financed from current revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members referred briefly last Thursday to the proposal of the British Airports Authority to increase its charges by 12 per cent, in line with inflation in the next financial year. This means that charges at Heathrow and Gatwick may go up by 17 per cent. This is intolerable for British Airways. Its bill from the authority is likely to increase from £52 million to £60 million in a full year, an increase of 16 per cent., while its revenue is increasing at about only half that rate. At the same time, the Government are denying British Airways the ability to increase its fares by anything like the rate of inflation. Applications by British Airways for some increases of 3 per cent, in European air fares were recently rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which charges to airlines will be reduced is for airports to be sold off and for them to compete with one another. There is very little competition between the principal gateways into London. The situation would be greatly improved by selling off the component parts of the British Airports Authority in England and Scotland. I do not believe that Stanstead need have nearly as bleak a future as some people imagine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The attitude of the British Airports Authority to general aviation into Heathrow and even to some extent into Gatwick leaves much to be desired compared with the attitude of the operators of major airports in the United States and the principal airports in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I could not be present because I was away on official parliamentary duties. I am conscious that my hon. Friends have more than adequately dealt with some of the detail of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Under-Secretary of State made some remarks which are worth probing a little further. When he spoke about air traffic, and answered some questions about northern airports, he said that passengers should not be forced to use airports that did not suit their needs. I am sure that that is highly principled and very attractive for the passengers, but contained in such a statement it also presents many other problems for those who must live with airports in their environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State said that from time to time massive traffic congestion was created in London, which is a problem that must be tolerated by the residents of the London area. There would appear to be a case for some sort of control, because in all ordered societies there are impositions and restrictions en everyone to make a balanced community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to my area of the North-West of England, where we have Manchester airport, which is an international airport of the highest repute. The Under-Secretary of State mentioned Liverpool airport to one of his hon. Friends. I am sure he will
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
agree that, when I make special reference to Manchester airport, it can at least be acknowledged that it is one of the few highly successful international airports in Britain and possibly in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It bothers me greatly that hon. Members who have spoken have mentioned massive costs and more air terminal expansion in the South. That will conse quently cost a considerable amount of money. The case is already being made that Manchester airport still—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must remind the hon. Gentleman that Manchester is not a British Airports Authority airport and therefore does not come under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but the Under-Secretary of State made a few remarks which it would be useful to clarify for the record. If you will be a little tolerant with me, Mr. Mitchell, I shall be grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter mentioned by the Minister was privatisation. That worries me a little, because Manchester airport is one of the few that are making a very handsome profit. That handsome profit is being ploughed back to the ratepayers, two million of whom annually receive the benefits of the courageous and determined investment of public money that has taken place for many years. I am worried about whether there are other factors in the Minister's mind which will not wear off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the good weather in the extreme North of Britain. It is rather novel that often many flights are diverted from London to Manchester, where the weather conditions are better. Everyone seems to believe that if one lives in the North-West of England one has webbed feet, but I can assure the Committee that that is not so. Manchester airport has a proud and handsome record of weather conditions. It diverts a large amount of money into the coffers of the Manchester ratepayers from extra profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that an inquiry is being conducted at the moment about the extensions down south, but if we are conscious about public expenditure, is there a justifiable need for millions of pounds of further investment when the Minister's Department knows full well that we have an airport such as Manchester, which has a greater capacity and an excellent service? Will he comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish I knew many good things to say about Southampton airport, although it is not a British Airports Authority airport, but I am sure, Mr. Mitchell, that you would be as firm with me as you have been with my hon. Friend if I tried to say them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the speedy response from the Minister to the question that I asked about his discussions with the British Airports Authority about a link between the railway station and the airport at Pres-wick. I hope that the discussions will be fruitful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it from me to offer the Minister any advice about what might be done, because there are various options that the British Airports Authority could consider for a proper link between the railway
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
station and the airport, but I hope that he will not let the chairman of the British Airports Authority off the hook with some vague promise. I hope that he will ask the chairman to study the matter seriously and consider its feasibility. At the moment, the position is appalling. Passengers must get off the train and either take a taxi for a very short distance—which is a ridiculous thing to do—or walk into the High Street at Prestwick, go up the High Street and into the airport. The link is impossible. I do not know whether any hon. Members have tried it, but I invite them to come to Prestwick and have a go. Some of the more fit Members may manage it, but the hon. Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright) and I would be greatly inconvenienced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will ask the chairman of the British Airports Authority to consider closely the land acquisition that may be necessary and the sort of permanent link that may be possible. I hops that he will press the British Airports Authority to discuss the matter with British Rail, because obviously it would be closely involved. As the meeting is scheduled for this evening and as we shall probably be here again on Thursday, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us then what Mr. Payne said in response to his proposals. I should be grateful for that, as would my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) and all my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is a stand part debate, I have a few points to make that I omitted from my contribution last week. I do not disagree in any way with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer), but I wish to make one other point about the relationship between discussions on targets, performance indicators and efficiency of the airport and the question of consumer satisfaction. Sometimes performance indicators and increased efficiency can go too far. If accountants are deciding policy, and the only criteria in decision-making are figures, balance sheets and accounts, often the wrong decisions are made. I hope that we shall not totally be caught up with the need. I know that the Government are very anxious about expenditure, but I hope that that will not be the only criterion. I hope that they will consider not only the figures about passengers per employee but the satisfaction of the passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn (Mr. Martin) mentioned the inadequacy of the catering facilities. If the staff is reduced for the services provided, the services become inferior. The Minister made some comments about baggage handling for which it is also important to have the right number of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) mentioned the currently equable weather at Prestwick. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham) described it as " the far north ". I am not sure that the Minister would not think of Prestwick as " the far north", as his constituency is hundreds of miles north of that, and even when in his constituency there are still
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
hundreds of miles of Scotland left. Prestwick may seem " the far north " to some people, but to us it is the south-west.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The point to this story is that the reason why the plane was unable to get off before the snow really came down was that there was not enough de-icing equipment. Money should be spent not only on providing equipment but on keeping it in order. It was a sudden snowstorm, and some of the equipment was not working properly. It is important for an airport to keep its equipment in order. It is already snowing today, and the winter is likely to be a harsh one, so the equipment will be necessary this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem was mentioned in the report of theCommittee of Public Accounts when it asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the harsh winter of 1978–79, how do you ensure against, or take account of, the possibility of other bad v, inters, and of safeguarding Heathrow, say, against the severe criticism that it had apparently been unable to face up to the consequencese of a high snowfall winter?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister will obviously have an interesting evening—we are giving him many things to talk about to the British Airports Authority.

I had a terrible experience at London airport not long ago, just at this time of year as we approach the Christmas Recess. I had the misfortune to have the Adjournment debate on the very last sitting day before Christmas—the competition was not great. I started the debate, and it was just beginning to snow, as it is today. It became worse and worse as the debate went on. When it was concluded, I took the Underground to Heathrow airport and the snow was still coming down. The passengers went on the plane while the snow came down and got worse. Eventually, to cut a long story short, we spent six hours in the British Airways plane. The passengers, particularly the women, were becoming hysterical and running out of the aircraft because of the length of time they had spent there and the claustrophobic atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Report 738 of the Committee of Public Accounts also mentions rent and other charges to the concessionaires at airports, particularly London airport. I wonder if the Minister can discuss with the authority the excessive profits being made by the dutyfree shops. I know this is an important element in the costing of the airport, but recently I have had a number of complaints from people about the excessive cost and particularly about the term
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
"duty free". If the duty is reduced we should be told that it is "duty reduced"—it is not duty free. How is it possible to arrive at the current prices, particularly at Heathrow, if all the duty has been taken off? The answer is that a substantial profit is then added to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have given the Minister enough topics not only for his reply today but also for his discussions with the chairman of the British Airports Authority when he sees him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.35 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the Committee wishes to get on, but I feel that it is only right and proper for the matter of landing charges to be raised. I am greatly concerned by two pieces of paper we have received since we last met. One is headed " British Airways Guidelines: Airport charge increases must be opposed ", and the other is a letter from the managing director of the British Airports Authority saying that he strongly refutes the claim circulated by British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airports Authority says that it is proposing to increase its landing charges by 12 per cent, while British Airways say that the increase is likely to be 17 per cent. Whichever is right, the increases are high. I am concerned that the increased charges will have a damaging effect on the private operators who operate from Heathrow. Whereas the State airline seems to have recourse to increased powers to borrow money, such as the opportunity under clause 2, the private airlines do not have the same chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be an increase of even 12 per cent., which is the proposed increase that the British Airports Authority is putting to its board today, that is 8 per cent, more than the current rise of wages in the public sector. It will cause considerable hardship to the private airlines. It will mean that the price of fares will go up, particularly on the domestic routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wishes to privatise the State dominated routes, particularly the trunk routes, it will be increasingly difficult for the private operators to compete if they are to face an increase of anything like 12 per cent, in the landing charge. These are matters with which the Comittee is rightly concerned. I can see my hon. Friend the Member for Southgate (Mr. Berry) turning round to signify his concern, and I am sure that all members of the Committee are as concerned as he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respond first to the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer), and thank him for his kind remarks. When I used the word "before", I may have appeared rather more opaque in my use of language than is my wish or custom. I did that because I am under yet more constraints due to the present Stansted inquiry. It would be improper to dwell at any length on that inquiry because, at the end of the day, I may have to consider the report which is produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let me try to explain succinctly the force of "before". Before the inquiry was set up, the Government were minded to develop Stansted fur
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
ther. Without changing their mind, the Government are now obliged to open their mind to further evidence and to the report which may come out of the Stansted inquiry. That is precisely the situation now, and I hope, without wishing to be opaque or cloaking the actions or thoughts of the Government, that the hon. Member for Batley and Morley will accept that that is the current situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Under-Secretary engages in his forthcoming talks with Norman Payne of the British Airports Authority, will he specifically inquire how in the past year it has spent some £10 million for the acquisition of land in the Stansted area in advance of the outcome of the inquiry? The Under-Secretary knows perfectly well that as it now exists Stansted is more than adequate for its current traffic and for the traffic that can be foreseen in the immediate future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without going into the latter part of the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), which is fair, there are two answers. One, the expenditure by the British Airports Authority is a matter for the economic consideration and judgment of the British Airports Authority board. The £10 million was used with the very best of intentions to protect residents and people living and owning property in the area against the possibility of planning blight arising out of the British Airports Authority's intention, subject to relevant consents, to develop Stansted. That is why it was done. It is a normal procedure. There is nothing abnormal about it. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that the British Airports Authority was acting with the best of intentions to protect the property values of residents living in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point made by the hon. Member for Batley and Morley concerned the revision of air traffic forecasts. That is a fair point and, as soon as we received the revision, we immediately decided that it must be put to those who had given evidence at the Gatwick 2 inquiry. We did that as soon as possible in conjuction with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, and we are now awaiting and will consider the comments of those who care to respond to our invitation about part of the forecasts being lowered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is true that part of the range of forecasts have been lowered, even the lowest forecasts—speaking from memory—show an increase of 70 per cent, of traffic over the next 15 years. The upper end very much more. Therefore, my right hon. Friends are not now minded to say " No " to Gatwick 2 because of the revision of the forecasts. However, they thought it fair to put the new figures to those who had given evidence to the inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, by any chance, it was concluded that it was no longer necessary to proceed with Gatwick 2, where would that leave the Stansted inquiry? Surely it would be automatically wound up if the effect was that the limited amount of additional passenger handling capacity already agreed was reversed as a result of the new figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an important point, although he must understand that it is not so much a point for me as for those conducting the Stansted inquiry. It would be a germane point to be considered by the inquiry. However, that certainly would not automatically mean that the inquiry ended. It is a piece of fresh evidence that the inquiry might want to consider, but I put it no higher than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the vexed question of the 6 per cent, current cost account return, which the hon. Member for Batley and Morley raised, I shall read to the Committee what the Labour Government's White Paper of 1978 enunciated as the principle. They did not consider
	<br><blockquote><p>"that there is any justification for air transport facilities in general to be subsidised by the taxpayer and the ratepayer."</p></blockquote>
That is the principle on which the previous Labour Government and the present Government proceeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Government have added to that principle the precise and specific statistic that in order to achieve the principle there laid down there should be in our best calculations a 6 per cent. CCA rate of return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exact amount can be quibbled about but, without going into great detail—because I am constrained on the user charges problem—for many years the British Airports Authority has been living off the fat of the duty-free shops and other concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the latest reports, which I do not have but know from memory, the hon. Member for Batley and Morley will understand that even in recent years the amount of money which has come in as income from; traffic is less than the amount of money which has gone out as expenditure. Even with the increase, we are still not getting a satisfactory return for the future. We certainly would not have got a satisfactory return unless we had the determination to ensure that all nationalised industries, including the British Airports Authority, made a proper return on capital employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Batley and Morley asked a very fair point: what has been the result of that? The British Airports Authority got a current cost account return last year of 5-9 per cent. Our best estimate this year is that it expects to get a return of 4-2 per cent. I reiterate what I said during our previous sitting: the CCA return is a flexible criterion in that it is supposed to be spread over three years. I am therefore glad that the British Airports Authority is well on target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Batley and Morley thought that my noble Friend in the other place had got it wrong when he said that borrowing on the market would be more expensive. However—many of my hon. Friends may want to take up this point—borrowing from the National Loans Fund is cheaper than borrowing on the market. Even with the Government acting as a type of guarantor of last resort, it is cheaper to borrow from the National Loans
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
Fund than on the normal market. Therefore, what was said in the House of Lords is correct. Whether or not the taxpayer subsidises the nationalised industries by providing loans at a cheaper rate than would be available to hon. Members is a point that my hon. Friends may wish to take up on another occasion. However, it does not come so well from the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Simply to get the record straight, will the Under-Secretary look again at the question and answer and confirm, in due course, that at issue was not borrowing from the market and the Public Works Loan Board but internal as opposed to external finance? The answer given in the other place appeared to imply that borrowing money, rather than financing from internal revenues, would in some way be a subsidy from public funds. That point simply escapes me. The clear impression given was that to finance more investment by borrowing rather than from internally-generated funds—from revenue—would mean:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a subsidy from public funds".—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 26th November 1981; Vol. 425, c. 851.]</p></blockquote>
That point totally escapes me, and I simply do not understand it. I was making that point and not suggesting that the British Airports Authority should borrow from the market as opposed to the Public Works Lean Board, which is a red herring that has been successfully introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not believe that the hon. Gentleman would prefer that. I should like to look at the precise question to which he referred. I imagine that my noble Friend was making the same point that I am making, which is that if the British Airports Authority borrows from the National Loans Fund, it gets the money at a subsidised rate of interest. That rate of interest is subsidised by the taxpayer, as opposed to any other sources of funds that may be available from franchises, duty-free shops, and so on, where the money is paid by members of the public who wish to purchase what is for sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Batley and Morley referred to performance criteria. He asked whether the report that we commissioned following the PAC's comments had come in and what it said. The answer is that a preliminary report has come in, but a great deal more work will be needed before it is in a fit state to be put before the House of Commons. We are working on that with all possible speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention two other performance criteria, about which the hon. Member for Batley and Morley made inquiries. He asked whether there were any other performance criteria. There are. This is relevant to a matter raised by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire. There is a performance criterion about customer complaints. Those have been monitored and are being checked. I am glad to tell the Committee that over the last 12 months the number of complaints by customers has gone down at British Airports Authority airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one consumer criterion that we have instituted. We are aware of the need not to be entirely bound by accountants, as the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
for South Ayrshire rightly said, but there is a tightrope to be walked between what the accountants seek to persuade the board to accept and what is beneficial to the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there is a welcome trend in that consumer complaints have gone downwards. Does he agree that that is either because people are more satisfied with the service or because, when they raise complaints, nothing is done and they become so fed up that they decide that there is no point in raising them again? Will the Minister assure us that it is for the former reason that the number of complaints has gone down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is right. When I saw the statistics that showed that the number of complaints had gone down, I wondered whether that was because of the heavy burden of apathy over the years, which meant that the customers had thought that it was not worth while to complain. However, that was rejected by implication. The British Airports Authority is extremely concerned about its public image. It does everything possible to improve not only the image but the reasons for the image. It is monitoring and will analyse what that monitoring brings forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other performance criterion that I mentioned was the speed with which baggage is transferred to the carousel after touchdown. That is important and shows how the British Airports Authority is doing everything possible to help the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-North-wood mentioned Stansted and user charges in his normal forceful way. I hope that he will accept that I cannot go into more detail other than to say, like the late President de Gaulle: "I hear my hon. Friend."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham) made an interesting contribution. We are considering British Airports Authority airports, and it is natural that the hon. Gentleman would like to consider the effect of what we are giving to the British Airports Authority on the airports that are not part of the British Airports Authority, such as Manchester airport. I agree with him that Manchester is an exceptional example of what a non-British Airports Authority airport can do. I went there the other day when I opened the International Civil Aviation Conference. I was taken to the perimeters of the runway and shown the improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree about the way in which Manchester conducts its finance. Many other local authority airports could learn much from the efficiency and the proper accounting procedures applied by Manchester. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Government have allowed a record amount of capital expenditure to non-British Airports Authority airports this year—well over £40 million. Manchester will benefit from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there was a need for increased spending in the South-East of England on the British Airports Authority airports
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
of Heathrow and Gatwick. The answer is that there is that need, but it is not a contradiction in terms to say that we wish to encourage traffic to go through Manchester. The two matters are separate. There is a need, for the 36 million passengers going through the London airports, to provide improved facilities there. There is also a great opportunity for an airport such as Manchester to draw on the catchment area that surrounds Greater Manchester and to make Manchester into a bigger and better airport for those who live in the Manchester area or who wish to come into that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Minister about Manchester, but I emphasise an underlying point. As an international airport, Manchester serves not just Manchester, but areas up to the Scottish border. It is not just for a parochial reason that we say that we want to see more traffic and the expansion of Manchester. Spinoff benefits to the nation, for example in tourism and many other areas, possibly industrial development, would come in the wake of expansion. Therefore, we are not being parochial when we talk about our own airports. People in Cumbria, Yorkshire and Newcastle are saying with one voice that it would be a great shot in the arm for all areas if Manchester could be given encouragement by the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. It is the intention of the Department to encourage Manchester in every reasonable way. The allowance for capital expenditure is one such way. I am fully aware that the airport serves not just the city of Manchester but a huge catchment area. I know of the efforts that those who run the airport are making to improve the surface transport to and from the airport. I hope to go there in the near future to see it in greater detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire also mentioned the rail link to Prestwick Airport. I doubt whether anything can be done by Thursday, but I shall do my best to proceed as fast as possible. With regard to the accountants and consumers, I have mentioned already that the monitoring of the British Airports Authority has regard to what the consumers want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also drew attention to the winter problems. In the few moments that I have free with Mr. Norman Payne this evening, I shall attempt to discuss that matter and the duty-free shops, which play such an important part in the British Airports Authority's finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Steen), I shall see that the documents that have been received from British Airways and the British Airports Authority are studied by those two organisations and that they give their comments to me. I shall be glad to pass them on to anyone who wishes to see them.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that we wish to make all possible progress within reason, but I am sure that hon. Members do not want to proceed at the cost of proper debate on various matters. We have indicated our willingness to ensure that the debate proceeds without undue delay. Nevertheless, a number of points are likely to require substantial discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two of our amendments, relating to British Airways, are essentially probing amendments. The Committee will readily appreciate that we do not wish to reduce the finances available to British Airways. We well understand that, in common with most other bodies wishing to pursue a substantial investment programme, such finance may be a necessary part of its programme. Before turning to the subject of denationalisation or privatisation, I wish to deal with the question of British Airways finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
I think that all members of the Committee realise that British Airways, in common with almost every other airline in the world, has had an exceptionally difficult time over the past couple of years and may expect an extremely tough time in the immediate future. As we know, that is the result not only of the further rapid increase in oil prices and the effects of recession but of the adjusting mechanism of market relationships between the different airlines in the air routes of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the boom in Atlantic travel was in part related to the value of the pound—or of the dollar, whichever way one looks at it. It was also thought to be related to the reduction in air fares o nthose routes. As a newcomer to the scene, I have not yet had the opportunity fully to assess what lay behind and what were the consequences of the reduction in fares. Any remarks that I make are therefore at best tentative and based at this stage on an extremely cursory examination of the matter. Nevetheless, I believe that when the developments of that period are examined, there will be important lessons to be learned for civil aviation about pricing and air routes. This should not be a matter of partisan difference between us, but it is one to which considerable attention should be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I address myself to just a few points at this stage, and I repeat that my comments are not based on the kind of examination that I intend to give the matter. They are very much preliminary views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I believe that the so-called expansion of traffic which was thought to be related to low fares may turn out to be less great than was supposed, and the impression created in the public mind about the benefits of this may turn out to be less than fully justified. I believe that this is an example of how the public may have a distinct impression about what is happening without perhaps realising the full facts of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as has been seen in the recent discussions in Geneva, I believe that sooner or later industries with massive investments and massive lead times will engage in unregulated cut-throat tactics at almost everyone's peril. It is far easier to get into that difficulty than to get out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is almost certainly a genuine problem of over-capacity which must be resolved but which I believe cannot be resolved simply through market pricing mechanisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are three first views on what I regard as an important part of airline history. Can the Minister give the Committee any assessment of what progress has been made in the discussion on Atlantic pricing which I undertand have been taking place in Geneva? This is enormously important for British Airways. No discussion of borrowing requirements or the investment programme can make sense unless there is a satisfactory answer on this. Indeed, if there were no time constraints, I suspect that we should suggest that the Government bring the Bill back in six months when we have a better idea of what may emerge. However, time is not on our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
side and we must make progress in the present situation. For that reason, we do not intend to delay progress at this stage. Nevertheless, I suspect that we shall make that progress without the benefit of the fullest view of the unfolding situation that we would like to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the parallel question of European air fares. I have given some preliminary views on the Atlantic routes. I have even less knowledge of the European routes, and I wish to ask the Minister a question about them. He is perfectly entitled to say that I should know all about it and to ask why I have not read up on it. The short answer is that I have not had the time. Nevertheless, I am sure that other members of the Committee would also find it useful if the Minister could give us a broad outline of the Secretary of State's response to the various European Commission reports on air fares and on the draft directive. I have not yet had time to read it, but I believe that the Secretary of State issued a substantial letter running to several pages in response to the directive. It would be helpful if the Committee could be reminded of the bare bones of that response. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the time scale now is for movements in relation to the draft directive, what kind of development he expects and when, and the likely significance of this for British Airways in particular but also for other British airlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The threat to British Airways' route systems was one of the many matters that we considered when the previous Civil Aviation Bill was in Committee. There was concern at that time about whether routes would be taken from British Airways and about the effect of that on profitability. Again, it would be helpful, now that the Act is in operation, if the Minister could give his assessment of what has happened in the intervening period and whether he sees any further clouds on the horizon by way of threats to British Airways' route systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for me to comment on the stories and possibilities that one hears postulated, but many hon. Members will take the view that British Airways are the flag carrier of this country, that they have been an effective airline over the years, and that they are, of course, improving their productivity and efficiency day by day. We would not wish to see their problems made worse at this difficult time by losing some of their routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Privatisation has so far proved to be an illusion. We forecast that at the time of the Civil Aviation Bill 1980, and there are now signs that many of the activities of British Airways are a desperate bid by the Government to get the airline into some sort of financial shape in order to sell it off before a general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, there is nothing wrong with improving efficiency and attempting to keep costs down wherever possible, but it would be wrong if decisions were taken in a time scale simply in order to meet a political deadline, without weighing
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
up the various consequences of the decision. There is always a balance in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Minister will obviously recognise that the Opposition totally oppose the notion of selling off—I expect him to reaffirm the Government's intentions in that direction—I hope that he will be able to assure us that a political deadline is not being imposed in such a manner that British Airways would have to act in such a way that they would not otherwise feel was in their and their employees' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Under-Secretary of State gave a specific and immediate pledge. He said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government intend to denationalise and privatise British Airways at the earliest practical moment."—	<i>[Official Repoit,</i> 16 November 1981, Vol. 12, c.84.]</p></blockquote>
If the word "practical" means "judicious", and not "political", while opposing the move, we shall at least understand the method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw to the attention of the Committee two further points about privatisation. It would be of concern if there were to be some sort of writing-off of British Airways' debts or a capital reconstruction that in effect—I shall not say " cooked the books"—so produced a package that enabled British Airways to be seen in one light under private ownership and in a different light under nationalised ownership. If there is an argument for capital reconstruction or so changing the financial arrangements of a nationalised industry, it should be done on its merits, regardless of privatisation. Do the Government have any thoughts along those lines?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to draw attention to the effects of privatisation on employees' pensions. During the Committee proceedings on last year's Civil Aviation Bill one drew specific attention to the great concern of employees that the pension arrangements that had been entered into through proper negotiation and agreement between employer and employee would be threatened as a result of the Government's stated and clear intention to privatise British Airways. Naturally, the large number of employees of British Airways were bound to be—as it has turned out, with justice—concerned about the threat to pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us agree that pensions, next to housing and the wage packet, are the most important conditions of service and the most important aspect of people's lives. The threat to an established, decent pension scheme is one of the most serious reductions of employment standards that could be made to anyone. This is relevant to the debate because there is currently a proposal from British Airways that would have the effect of significantly reducing and worsening pension conditions of British Airways employees. The manner in which it is being done and the terms of the reductions are causing great concern and provoking much opposition from the employees of British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that the pension arrangements for British Airways staff are in line with pension arrangements in the public service generally. The Minister still has some responsibility for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
British Airways, and I ask him to look again, with British Airways management, at the arrangements for those pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reductions in pensions will fall most harshly on the lowest paid. It is not for us to enter into the current discussions between the employer and employees, but it is a consequence and in part as a result of the previous Bill and the financing arrangements of British Airways that this move is being made now. We hope that British Airways, through the financing arrangements that they are able to make, will be able to look again at the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can make reasonable progress and that the Secretary of State will deal with the issue of pensions. Tens of thousands of employees are involved, and they would be most concerned if we discussed the finance of British Airways and their future without considering the matter and hearing the Minister's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of increasing the borrowing limits is, of course, to finance investment. What will be the investment programme over the five- or seven-year period? In so far as there is a non-aircraft component of that investment programme, will the Minister indicate the balance between the aircraft and non-aircraft components? Will he also indicate the internal-external financing ratio that exercised our minds in relation to the British Airports Authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary of State indicate what that ratio is, in relation to British Airways. In so far as there is a difference, will he state the reasons for the difference in internal financing from revenues in the two authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is similar in intention to the two amendments which I moved in a previous debate. The effect would be to allow the borrowing limit of British Airways to be raised to £1,200 million but would withdraw the provision for further charges of £1,400 million and £1,600 million to be raised by statutory instrument. In other words, we would be voting an increase in the borrowing limit of an extra £200 million up to £1,200 million, but the two further tranches of £200 million would no longer be applicable. I believe that is right in principle. I have always believed that the House of Commons should exercise the strictest control over the borrowings of nationalised industries, and the best way to do that is to ensure that a Bill is passed by the House of Commons and that extra borrowing should not be provided by means of statutory instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extra borrowing provided—the extra £200 million—should be sufficient for British Airways to put their house in order and to carry out modest re-equipment and significant re-structuring along the lines of their corporate plan in time for the privatisation of British Airways to take place by the end of financial year 1982–83. I comprehend the suggestion that it may be impracticable to imagine that equity finance will be found at a time of deep reces-
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
sion when the airline is making losses. It is important to establish privatisation during the life of this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important aspect of British Airways finances is the debt equity ratio. It is the trend of the debt equity ratio that leads me to speak on the amendment because if the full borrowing is permitted and if the upper limit is raised to £1,600 million, the ratio of debt to equity will be of the order of 5 to 1. That is a horrendous burden of debt on the airline. The trend in the last two financial years has already been seriously adverse. In 1980, the ratio of borrowing to equity was 52 to 48. In financial year 1981 that had moved to a ratio of 71 to 29. If we allow the full extra £600 million which is envisaged, it will become a debt equity ratio of the order of 5 to 1. I do not believe that the airline is in a position to finance that, given the current level of interest rates. The airline should be rationalising its operations still further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am appreciative of the immense sacrifices that have been made by the employees of British Airways many of whom are residents in my constituency. Office facilities in South Ruislip in particular are being done away with by British Airways and the functions transferred to Heathrow airport. The employees are not receiving a pay increase until September 1982. About 10,000 jobs have been lost with the objective of reducing British Airways manning to 43,000 by the middle of 1982. Some 16 international routes have been suspended and there are changes in the methods of operating Scottish services with the introduction of purely turbo-prop internal operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also changes in Europe. Certain routes are being discontinued and great advances are being made in fuel saving. These measures, however, will not be adequate to pull the airline round. We should set out a clear objective—I have said this before—that by the end of financial year 1982-83 the airline should be so structured, reorganised and rationalised as to provide a good, sound investment for future equity participants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not as unrealistic as some people would imagine. If British Airways operations can be concentrated largely at Heathrow, if all ideas of further diversions of operations to Stansted are removed and if the impediments of, as it were, flag carrier operations on the thinner routes are taken away, there is a chance of privatisation by 1982-83. Hon. Members may accuse me of being totally unrealistic, but if we allow this opportunity to pass, I cannot envisage when British Airways will be privatised. The employees have made sacrifices and major changes have been made in British Airways' operations. If all those measures were taken with no clear objective in mind, and if we were merely to allow the airline to continue to borrow more and more, the capital reconstruction to which the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer) referred would become inevitable. Unless privatisation takes place and unless there is an injection of equity from the market, I cannot see how the equity base of British Airways can be broadened without
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
a capital reconstruction. That would cost the taxpayer money and, in the present economic circumstances, I do not believe that that should be condoned by the House. Therefore, economic necessity demands that we carry through the privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be argued that we shall be selling off a proportion of State assets at a cheap, bargain, price but there is no other way in which the necessary private investment can be secured. Therefore, private investment must be secured. At the same time, we would have a substantial degree of employee participation. The acquisition of shares by employees is to be thoroughly encouraged. That was one of the better features of the privatisation of British Aerospace and that has helped to encourage the whole workforce of British Aerospace to have a degree of loyalty to that enterprise, which probably, they would not have otherwise had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) that the Government also carried out a similar exercise at ICL. The Government were very keen to privatise ICL and believed that that would be a roaring success. That same organisation is now in a state of collapse with thousands and thousands of jobs withering away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not nonsense. It is a fact. There are factories in my city where people are given 90 days notice and where the closure of the most modern factories is taking place. They use the very technology and science that the Government say they wish to expand. The workers in such factories will not be confident that their futures are assured from the type of statement that has just been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any parallel between the computer industry, what has befallen ICL, the kind of measures that its management has had to take, the situation of the civil air transport industry and the position of British Airways. British Airways have been profitable in the past. ICL has never undergone such intense rationalisation and its position is relatively encouraging. It has taken the harshest measures to get its house in order. This is extremely painful but there is no alternative. No one imagines that the taxpayer can continue ad infinitum to bail out ICL, but British civil Air transport and British Airways, in particular, have a reputation throughout the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways have a unique geographical position. They have an excellent route structure. The basis exists for building a thoroughly profitable airline. It presents a good long-term opportunity for the investor. I believe that employees within the airline have confidence in it and also' in their ability to win a larger share of the world market and to generate better profits than in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) talks about the privatisation of British Airways. Will he comment on
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
the profitability of British Airways? Does he believe that the trunk routes, particularly the domestic trunk routes, should receive a measure of private competition? As he knows, the major trunk routes in Britain are dominated by British Airways. My hon. Friend argues that British Airways should be privatised. Does he accept that in the interim con> petition should be allowed, or does he believe that British Airways should still be allowed to have sole monopoly on the trunk routes in order to achieve the maximum; return on their investment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that British Airways occupy a monopoly position on the trunk routes. They have a dominant position that is buttressed by the licensing policy of the Civil Aviation Authority. British Airways experience some competition, notably from Dan-Air and to some extent from British Midland and British Caledonian. I believe in a competitive domestic environment. When that occurs, one finds that the appropriate equipment is introduced for the route. This is happening to some extent in Scotland with the introduction of all turbo-prop services by British Airways. This is a timely reform. British Airways will have to examine closely whether they want to stay in the domestic business or whether this is not something that could more appropriately be handed over to private operators. These are decisions that British Airways will have to make. They will not be forced fully to concentrate their mind on the problems unless a date is set for the privatisation of the airline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To avoid more borrowing by British Airways and a reconstruction of their capital, the injection of private equity has, in the long term, to be accepted. It should be done in this Parliament, preferably by the end of the 1982–83 financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a folk song [HON. MEMBERS: "A' Foulkes' song"] or a "Foulkes song" which goes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When will they ever learn? "</p></blockquote>
I think of that refrain when listening to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson). I read again recently the proceedings on the Civil Aviation Bill Standing Committee when the now Secretary of State for Employment gave all sorts of assurances and predictions about British Airways. My right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith) made some cautionary noises and put the other point of view. I think that my right hon. Friend has been proved correct in almost everything he argued while the Secretary of State has moved wisely to greener pastures to get away from the havoc that he created by the Bill that he "piloted" through. That is not bad for this time of the morning. The right hon. Gentleman has now left matters to the Under-Secretary of State for Trade, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat).

	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
pride in the country of which they are citizens. They keep talking about patriotism and pride in the country, and yet British Airways have been the national carrier. The first action of developing countries when they become independent is to apply for membership of the United Nations. Their second action is to examine the feasibility of setting up an independent airline, a national carrier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And they mortgage themselves up to the hilt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many have great difficulties and get into trouble. It is surely the case, however, that a country such as the United Kingdom can still retain the concept of a national carrier and still ensure that British Airways are encouraged to develop as a national carrier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having read the proceedings of the Standing Committee to which I have referred, I feel that all that was prophesied by the Opposition has been proved correct. I think that we shall be proved correct again in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have expressed on a number of occasions the disappointment felt in Scotland, particularly in Ayrshire, that the national carrier has pulled out of Prestwick on transatlantic flights. I do not wish to dwell on the issue. My hon. Friends and I have been to see Sir John King and Mr. Roy Watts. We have expressed in no uncertain terms the views for which my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) is now famous. We have expressed forcibly and firmly our disappointment. Unfortunately, we were unable to persuade British Airways that they should reverse their decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of pulling out of Prestwick is now under way. We can only pin our hopes on the fact that there is at least one application—from Sir Freddie Laker—to take over the route. Sir Freddie has not so far, I understand, submitted his commercial justification for the routes to Toronto and New York. I hope that he does so quickly. The longer the gap between British Airways closing and any new operator starting, the less likely the new operator will be able to take over the traffic. People start to find alternative ways of getting to the United States and may travel through London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention the Scottish division of British Airways. I welcome the restructuring. I also welcome the decision of the Civil Aviation Authority not to grant licences to Loganair, Air Ecosse and Alidair on the lucrative Aberdeen to Shetlands route. This is exactly what private operators want to do. They look for the one or two routes that are most profitable and say they wish to undertake them. They want to enter the lucrative routes and take the maximum profit. They are not interested in the other routes. The Civil Aviation Authority is right in saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Authority concludes that the broader interests of users generally should prevail over the specific interests of users of services between Aberdeen and Shetland".</p></blockquote>
If British Airways started losing money on the Aberdeen-Shetlands route, some of the other routes within the Scottish division would be put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
It is good to see the Civil Aviation Authority taking this line. I hope that it will adopt this approach to similar applications to ensure that private operators are not allowed to take the pickings of the rich routes and put other routes in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise two specific points, because I know that we do not wish to go too far into Thursday's sitting. The first is the question of the shuttle. Perhaps the Minister could raise that question with British Airways as well as with the British Airports Authority. The shuttle is like a cattle train.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Steen) for once is absolutely right. It is disgraceful. People are herded like cattle from the shuttle lounge to the aircraft, especially at Heathrow. We have been told that the British Airports Authority is doing something about it, but the system could be improved in the mechanisms of checking in, counting passengers and checking passengers through to the aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently I had the opportunity to travel on the shuttle from Washington to New York. In my view, the systems for checking in are totally different and much more efficient. They can check in more passengers more quickly and more efficiently than can British Airways. I ask the Minister to talk to British Airways about that. I know that he probably uses the services as much as I, so perhaps it is in his interests as well as in the national interest to see that something is done about it. I hope that he will have some serious discussions about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that it would be advantageous if the shuttle service was not a monopoly? One reason why the cattle flights, as he describes them, are like that is that there is no-one to compete or to make British Airways buck up their ideas. I have some difficulty in reconciling the hon. Gentleman's earlier statement about the low load routes with his views on the trunk routes. Surely he would agree that one of the most important things in Britain is to get away from the position that we have had to endure for years, where British Airways do what they wish because there is no-one competing with them to set a standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has high lighted a paradox, but not the paradox that he believes. There is competition on the Glasgow- London and Edinburgh-London routes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not from Heathrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as we understand it, Heathrow and Gatwick are interchangeable in South-East England. There is competition on the routes from London to Edinburgh and London to Glasgow. British Airways have problems with the facilities at Heathrow, which are very poor. However, the procedures for luggage check-in, security clearance and checking passengers on to the aircraft could be improved. I hope that some consideration will be given to that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12. 45pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As to the inconvenience of passengers and the facilities, does not my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) realise that the shuttle service is the most efficient one that I use? I probably use the service more than any other hon. Member, because I go up and down to my constituency as well as working here. It is the most efficient service, a fact that is being proved. On the 5 o'clock plane yesterday there was difficulty in getting a seat. The British Caledonian plane—which is private enterprise—was nearly empty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because it was going to Gat-wick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One cannot get on to a shuttle now because of the efficiency and regularity of its service. You can depend upon it. It leaves on time and returns on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend realise that the new edition of " High Life " magazine published by British Airways—which I read yesterday—states that in order to overcome the difficulty of people having to wait in the limited shuttle accommodation at Heathrow and Glasgow airports, passengers will be allowed to enter the plane up to 25 minutes before take-off? Instead of keeping people in the lounges and then suddenly shouting " The shuttle for Glasgow is now open, will you all come forward ", one can merge in. That is a limited change but a vital one that will overcome the problems that my hon. Friend is highlighting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who seems to be taking over the Minister's role in replying to the debate, using " High Life " magazine as his brief. While I welcome the change in the check-in procedures—I was not aware of the 25 minute period—that will not achieve all that I wish to achieve at Heathrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have stood in queues on the stairs of the shuttle departure lounge at Heathrow. There have been many people with young children and many elderly people waiting to go through the security procedures. There is then a huge rush as people get to the exit gate and try to enter the aeroplane. That did not happen at Washington. I believe that the 25 minute period will help, but it will not improve matters absolutely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want some private operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) said about the efficient service provided by the shuttle. I have used it on many occaisons, but I have one main grouse about the arrangements at Heathrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to British Airways' purchasing policy for aircraft. I have raised the matter with British Airways. I ask the Minister what discussions the Government have had with British Airways about their purchasing policy. I am concerned that British Airways seem to be standardising with the Boeing aircraft—which are American—and are not taking advantage of the excellent aircraft being pro
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
duced by British Aerospace. I do not have the most recent information, but the last information that I received was that British Airways had no intention of purchasing the Airbus, the 146 or the Jetstream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some parts of aircraft that are assembled in America can be made in other countries. No doubt someone will say that some parts are made in the United Kingdom, but we should encourage British Aerospace and ensure that it is successful. It is reasonably successful at the moment, but one way in which it can go from success to success is to make sure that the national carrier of the United Kingdom: buys British aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to suggest that British Aerospace does not make the most marvellous aeroplanes at every level of its aviation activity—the hon. Gentleman must understand that—but because of British Airways' commitment in terms of both the aeroplane and the engines they use, the cost of introducing new aircraft would have a radical effect on their support services around the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman must agree that British Airways should make decisions on the basis of the best aircraft for their flights and operations throughout the world. It may be that the Jetstream, the 146 and the Airbus, wonderful aeroplanes though they are, do not fit the bill in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but do not understand how they can fit the bill of other airlines with similar route structures to British Airways and they do not fit the requirements of British Airways. I recognise that it is sensible to concentrate on one manufacturer. There are some arguments for that, but also some against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today—perhaps the Minister can tell us about it—Lockheed is discontinuing production of the Tri-Star, yet British Airways seem to use that aircraft as one of their main aircraft in the fleet. Perhaps the cessation of production of the TriStar by Lockheed will have some effect on British Airways. I hope that if it does have an effect and if they are seeking another aircraft manufacturer, it will be British Aerospace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that the content of British-made parts and equipment in the Boeing 757 is actually greater than that in the airbuses? The 757 aircraft to be ordered by British Airways are to be powered by Rolls-Royce RB211–535 engines. Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that in value terms that is a higher British content than the airbus?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I was sure that hon. Members would raise with me the fact there is British content in many of the Boeing aircraft, particularly the notable example of Rolls-Royce engines. However, I am talking of the indigenous aircraft industry concentrated in Britain, especially British Aerospace. It is important to make sure that that has a successful future. The British national carrier should be encouraged to use British
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
aircraft. I am not sure that they have given full consideration to, the advantages of British Aerospace aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will tell us whether the Department of Industry has had some discussions with British Airways or if some gentle pressure has been put on them to buy British-built aircraft. That is the kind of policy we hear from the Government on many occasions and here is a good opportunity for them to put the policy into practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish either to oppose the clause or to support the amendments put forward by the Opposition but to direct a few pertinent questions to the Minister about some of the effects of the Government's aviation policy. Secondly, I take a slightly different view from that expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-North-wood (Mr. Wilkinson) on the timing of privatisation of British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in committee will need to be persuaded that British Airways face a large and daunting array of problems. The recession in world air traffic is not something which they alone experience but there is no doubt that as the international airline with the largest network of routes they have been particularly affected over the last 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways have been, by their own admission, over-staffed for many years. To their credit they have in recent months been turning their attention to slimming down their workforce to a more reasonable size. They are, at the same time, disposing of assets so that from almost every point of view we have to concede that British Airways are trying to help themselves out of their dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some would say that they are doing so not a moment too soon, and I agree, but it would be churlish not to accept that considerable efforts are being made. These efforts have not been assisted by the series of air traffic controllers' strikes earlier this year which in many ways have had a more devastating effect on British Airways than almost anything else. Nothing deters the traveller more than the lack of certainty about whether, when he turns up at the airport, he will be able to fly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strikes exacerbated the already considerable difficulties of British Airways. There is the further problem of their unprofitable routes. I was pleased to note that British Airways are withdrawing from some of the more unprofitable routes although I am by no means convinced that they have withdrawn from all those routes where by no stretch of the imagination is it ever likely that they could fly profitably. Nevertheless, they have embarked on a cut back of these routes and are to be congratulated for grasping this commercial nettle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member is very knowledgeable and I wonder whether he could explain how some routes, for example the Prestwick to Toronto and the Prestwick to New York routes, are deemed by British Airways to be unprofitable, and why if British Airways withdraw from them other airlines can see a potential profit. Perhaps because of their operating structure and the way in
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
which they run routes, British Airways have made the routes unprofitable, although they are not inherently so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may or may not be so. I am no expert on the Prestwick to New York and Toronto routes. However, understanding the hon. Gentleman's devotion to the maintenance of British Airways services from Prestwick, a consideration in the mind of British Airways when they decided to withdraw from Prestwick must have been that If they did not fly any services from any particular airport the need to man the basic services would reduce financial outlay. If they were flying full aircraft from Prestwick to New York and Toronto, and even if the costs of maintaining the structure—the presence—at Prestwick were in their opinion excessive, we could not assess the wisdom of the British Airways decision only on the load factors on the routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways have also been faced at a particularly difficult time with competition from the independent airlines. I support the policy in general, but there can be no denying that it has had a further disadvantageous effect on British Airways which has led to the dilution of revenues. Nowhere has that been more obvious than across the Atlantic. Finally, there has been the necessity for British Airways to turn their attention to the financing of new aircraft purchases. I do not need to say more to draw the Committee's attention to the formidable array of difficulties that British Airways have been faced with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the area of Government policy and ask whether there are not some areas in which the " perceived policy "—I use that phrase advisedly because I am never entirely sure that I understand the Government policy in certain areas—is always necessarily of the greatest assistance to British Airways, remembering that the most important policy to the airline is its disposal of at least 49 per cent, of the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to the subject of fares. I accept the limitation of the Government's role in settling fares but I am sure that the Minister will be the first to concede that the Government cannot contract out of that singularly important area of policy consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the Atlantic service, the Government are right to be proud that fares have come tumbling down to the consumers advantage. We must welcome that development, but one cannot simply leave it there without recognising that the result, in terms of the economics of the airlines, has been close to disastrous. We must somehow keep a balance between the consumers interests—understandably seeking a lower fare—and the continuing viability of British airlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the rates prevailing on the Atlantic routes simply cannot be profitable under any circumstances. Therefore, we are heading for the necessity of a substantial increase in transatlantic fares. I hope that the Government will not only stand in the way of such an increase but will recognise the inevitability of it if the economics of the airlines are to remain viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
I try to relate the pressures that I see building up—not only on the Government but by them on EEC airline fares—to what I have described as happening on the Transatlantic routes. I must concede immediately that there is undoubted scope for some reduction on some European routes. When there can be a load factor of no more than 15 per cent, and yet a route can run profitably, something is wrong.
