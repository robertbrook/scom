<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was drawn to my attention last night that there was a mistake in 	<i>Hansard</i> in relation to a contribution I made in the debate on prostitution. Unfortunately. I have looked for it this morning and cannot find it exactly, but I wonder whether permission might be given for the particular sentence to be amended. It was when I used a somewhat florid phrase about women selling their bodies to men. Unfortunately Hansard left the " n" off the men. Though the sentence is still legally correct, it leaves an imputation I am anxious to withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SENTENCING FOR MURDER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"In section 1(1) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, the word 'sentenced' shall be omitted and the word 'liable' shall be inserted".—	<i>[Mr. Kilroy-Silk.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause would make life imprisonment the maximum sentence for murder, not the mandatory sentence for murder as it is at present. This, as the Committee will know, was a recommendation of the Butler committee on Abnormal Offenders in 1975. It was a recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Penal System in its 1978 Report. It was also a recommendation of half the members of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, which on that particular occasion was fairly evenly divided in 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth recalling when we are debating this subject that when the Bill abolishing capital punishment and substituting mandatory life sentences was debated in another place, Lord Parker proposed an amendment very similar to the one we are discussing here today. The clause that he then proposed gave judges complete and unfettered discretion to determine the sentence to be imposed upon murderers. He argued that giving judges that kind of discretion—total discretion—to determine the length of sentence that would be imposed would enable them to mark out the seriousness of any par-
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
ticular offence with the length of sentence imposed while at the same time being able to show mercy in appropriate cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment that he then proposed was supported by all the Law Lords in the debate. It was actually carried in Committee, but unfortunately the whole thing was changed in what would appear to have been a fairly unsatisfactory and unhappy compromise on Report, when it was agreed that the life sentence should be mandatory, but that the judges would have the power to be able to make recommendatons as to the actual length of time an individual would serve in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that murder is an extremely important and grave offence. It must always be treated as a grave offence, but we also know that murders vary enormously one from another. There are those that are calculated, cold-blooded, premeditated and well-planned and which are properly to be despised and the offenders punished accordingly. But there are also those committed in what might be described as exceptional circumstances of great stress—perhaps great emotional turmoil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are quite different circumstances, and the individuals committing the murder are also themselves quite different and operating from totally distinct and separate motives. Unfortunately, at the moment judges do not have the ability to reflect in their sentences the varying degrees of culpability of the murderers committing the offence. The Butler committee pointed out that some manslaughters may be far more serious and culpable than some murders which may have mitigating circumstances. It quoted the words of Lord Kilbrandon in the case of Hyam, where he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is no longer true, if it ever was true, to say that murder, as we now defiine it, is necessarily the most heinous example of unlawful homicide."</p></blockquote>
Those members of the Criminal Law Revision Committee who supported this view in the committee's report "Offences Against the Person" published in 1980, pointed out that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many of those convicted of murder are much less of a danger than persistently violent robbers."</p></blockquote>
In the case of a persistent armed robber, the trial judge has complete discretion in the sentence he chooses to pass. In the case of a killing however, he has no discretion unless diminished responsibility or provocation are proved. As the Criminal Law Revision Committee's Report went on to say in paragraph 54:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are, of course, some killings under stress not amounting to provocation, where in spite of the psychiatric evidence the defence of diminished responsibility fails. In such a case or in cases where an accessory to murder has played only a small part a life sentence is undeserved and unnecessary for deterrence."</p></blockquote>
The Advisory Council on the Penal System argued in very similiar terms in its report " Sentences of Imprisonment—A Review of Maximum Penalties " published in 1978. It pointed out in paragraph 244 that murder:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not a homogeneous offence, but a crime of considerable variety. Instead of automatically applying a single sentence to such an offence, we believe that sentences for murder should reflect this variety with correspondingly variable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
terms of imprisonment or, in the exceptional case, even with a non-custodial penalty. This is primarily because we do not think that anyone should, without specific justification, be subject to the disadvantages which we see in indeterminate sentencing."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the statement he has just read out and how does he reconcile that with another new clause which I think he tabled making a custodial sentence mandatory in the case of rape?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do agree with the quotation I have just read out. The mandatory custodial sentence for rape clause was withdrawn by me after having reconsidered it and taken advice from my colleague, but in any event there is a distinction to be drawn between on the one hand saying, as we do for many offences, that a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed and saying here that in all cases and all circumstances—however much they may vary, however much to blame the individual committing the offence may be—the sentence shall be life. One can even maintain support if one wished to continue for a mandatory prison sentence to be imposed for rape offenders and at the same time support new clause 9 which removes the mandatory element of life sentences for murder. I see no inconsistency in supporting the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advisory Council whose report I just quoted also argued that efforts to alleviate the harshness of the mandatory life sentence had led to very serious complications in legal proceedings for which it believed there could be no proper justification. It meant by this the special defences of provocation and diminished responsibility which can reduce a murder conviction to manslaughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Butler committee went so far as to state that in order to enable a trial judge to show humanity in some cases, medical witnesses sometimes have to " stretch their conscience " in testifying as to whether one of the special defences applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another serious disadvantage results from the use of life sentence indiscriminately in all cases of murder, whether they really call for it or not. It dilutes what has been referred to as the " awe-inspiring " nature of this sentence. As the Criminal Law Revision Committee put it in paragraph 55:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As long as the life sentence is mandatory for all kinds of murder its imposition cannot mark the heinousness of any particular offence, nor can it appear to provide appropriate retribution."</p></blockquote>
It has been argued in support of the mandatory life sentence that a trial judge cannot be trusted to decide when it will be safe to let a defendant out. That argument is inconsistent with the fact that some mentally unstable defendants have their convictions reduced to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and in these cases the trial judge does have a discretion. If judges can be trusted with discretion in respect of disordered killers who are often, by definition, of the most unpredictable kind, they can surely be trusted to sentence relatively normal people who may have killed in circumstances of great emotional stress and great psychological upheaval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
Again, it has been suggested that if the mandatory life sentence were to be abolished, as is suggested by new clause 9, some judges would pass inordinately long determinate sentences in an effort to ensure that prisoners would not be released too soon. But if the courts took up that option, if they passed sentences which were inordinate or severe, presumably, that is something that could, and would, be rectified by the Court of Appeal. Therefore, there does not seem to me to be any substantial argument against the introduction of new clause 9 and the ending of mandatory life sentences for murder. Indeed, there was no powerful argument when this was first considered when capital punishment was being abolished and this was being debated in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying, and perhaps I should make this quite clear, that the offence of murder is not a serious and important offence because, clearly, it is serious and important and we have to regard it as such. I am not saying that in some cases life sentences are not appropriate because, clearly, they are appropriate in many cases of murder. Nor am I saying that in some cases a life sentence is inappropriate, because, again, clearly, a life sentence for some murderers, or a particular murder, is appropriate and may indeed be the only sentence that any sensible and reasonable person could impose at that particular time in those circumstances. I am saying that it is not necessary, nor is it desirable for all murderers, in all circumstances, at all times to be given a mandatory life sentence. I hope that the Minister and the Committee will agree with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the arguments for and against mandatory life sentence in the case of murder are finely balanced, and my hon. Friend has set out the arguments in favour of ending the mandatory sentence very well indeed, if he will not mind me saying so. The Committee is in a very fortunate position, because rarely do we have a document like the Criminal Law Revision Committee report in which both sides of the argument are so cogently put. Each argument that is put forward is the subject of a counter-argument in the report itself. So we are in the unique position of being able to see both sides put in an impartial way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I started by saying that I thought it was an evenly balanced argument. I come down against my hon. Friend on the grounds that the public's abhorrence of murder as an offence is so great that there is a need for them to see and to understand that those who administer the law regard it as such, and that because of the particular nature of the offence—the taking of a life—it should be marked by a unique punishment. The unique punishment is life imprisonment. That, to me, overrides the arguments that my hon. Friend has put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend and the Committee will know, the position at present is that the courts can, and frequently do, recommend a minimum period that the convicted murderer must serve. Sometimes that minimum period is very high. Also, even the prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment may be released on licence. On the recommendation of the Parole
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
Board, the Secretary of State may release him on licence. Equally, he may withdraw that licence, if other evidence comes to his notice. There are many cases where that has been done. In deciding whether a person should be released on licence, the Secretary of State should consult the Lord Chief Justice and, if possible, the trial judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, then, many safeguards as far as the convicted murderer is concerned, to ensure that there is a possibility of his being let out when the time is safe to do so, and when the public can feel satisfied that he is no longer a public danger. My hon. Friend says, in effect, that if judges can be trusted with passing determinate sentences, deciding how long a person should serve in prison, in the case of someone who has been guilty of murder but whose sentence has been reduced to manslaughter on account of diminished responsibility they should be similarly capable of deciding what the determined sentence should be in the case of somebody convicted of murder. He argues—an argument I can understand—that in the case of somebody who has been found to be suffering from diminished responsibility, the judge by its very nature is dealing with somebody who is suffering from a mental disorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a great difference between the judge's deciding in the case of somebody suffering from a mental disorder and thereby found to be not fully responsible for his actions at the time of committing the offence, and somebody whom the jury has found to have murdered in the full knowledge of what he is doing, and where the intent is fully there. In such a case a difficulty is presented to the judge of deciding when that person is likely, as far as the public are concerned, to be no longer a danger—in other words, no longer to present the likelihood of killing again. The two situations are very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that in other cases such as rape, robbery and grievous bodily harm with intent, life imprisonment is a possible penalty. In fact, it is very seldom imposed in these cases. Usually the penalty is six or seven years. That is the average sentence for crimes of that type. It would be rightly regarded by the public as completely inadequate in the case of murder. So I do not think that one can compare the two and say that because the judges can use their discretion in the case of rape or grievous bodily harm, they can similarly use their discretion in the case of murder. I do not think the public would take kindly to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that if one of the arguments against getting rid of the mandatory sentences was that judges would be tempted to pass very heavy sentences, such as 30 or 40 years, that would be all right because the Court of Appeal could deal with that by reducing the sentence if necessary. That is true, but what the Court of Appeal cannot do—and this has been proved to be a matter of great concern to the public in the recent rape case—is to increase a sentence if it thinks that the sentence is inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a case of murder where a low sentence has been passed because a judge has used his discretion, and perhaps used it wrongly—as everybody will agree
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
the judge in the now notorious rape case did—there would be a public outcry. There would be demands that the law should be changed to allow the Court of Appeal to have the power to increase the sentence. That is a separate argument. Some members of the Committee may feel that that should be done, but it would not be done by passing the amendment. The law would have to be amended in many other respects as well. I cannot see how the discretion of the judge to award a low sentence if he felt justified in doing so would not in some circumstances lead to some public outcry and some public outburst of rage and anger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, of course, aware of the arguments of the Butler committee, the Advisory committee, and of those on the Criminal Law Revision Committee who argued for a change, but it seems to me that on balance the present system give enough flexibility To my mind the public would not understand how any offence of murder did not merit life imprisonment. That seems to me to be axiomatic and I do not think it would be right to change it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone reading the Criminal Law Revision Committee's report—and I recommend that it should be read—will see clearly from the tables at the back that contrary to popular belief, most prisoners who are serving life sentences serve for a very long time indeed—10, 15 or 20 years in some cases. They certainly serve for far longer than the public are frequently led to believe is the case. There is a belief that nine years is about par for the course, but the tables give the lie to that, and I recommend that the Committee should study them carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman really consider that 10 to 15 years is a long time, compared with the sentences of the " Great Train Robbers"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think it is a long time at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is a long time, but I can see that in some cases people should spend longer in prison. There is a popular belief that life imprisonment merely means serving nine years. It does not mean that. In many cases—in most cases I would say—the majority of those serving life sentences serve far longer times than nine years. My hon. Friend has made a valid contribution by raising this matter, but on balance, I would be against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost as ambivalent as my hon. Friend about this issue. American jurisprudence allows for second degree murder so that on a perfectly formalised and somewhat rigid basis a distinction can be made between different types of murder. All of us know that something like 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of murders are, in fact, commited in the family, arising out of a family squabble or a family relationship, which is not normally the kind of situation which causes such anguish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In situations like that it would be possible for a judge to take a reasonable view about a sentence
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
which would be less than the normal. Equally, any kind of indeterminate sentence means that somebody has to decide when the accused is released and that somebody is the committee inside the Home Office, chaired by the Permanent Secretary, which normally liaises with the Parole Board and with the prisons and takes extreme care about when the release date should take place. Sometimes, more often under Conservative Governments than under Labour Governments, it is over-ruled in order to placate public opinion about a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the issue still has to be made that people are allowed out in something less than their natural life. Nobody has yet, as far as I know, ever been kept in for the whole spate of his natural life. When I was at the Home Office, I discovered that there was one man who had been there for 24 years and when I looked into the circumstances of his case I was satisfied that he could not be released. But the real reason why he could not be released was that he ought to have been in Broadmoor and not in a prison. His mental state was such that he would have been a danger had he come out. In a situation like that, where that man had been sent to prison rather than to Broadmoor, it would have been extremely difficult for the judge to have said that a particular finite period of imprisonment was safe for the community. That argues against allowing finite sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I had an experience which I think it is proper to make public at this stage because it is part of the argument. A man had been sentenced by Lord Salmon to life imprisonment following a trial for murder, a trial which took place over a day-and-a-half. When I arrived in the Home Office, I found that that man had been considered for release at eight years. All the evidence adduced by the psychiatrist, by the prison, by all the authorities had been enough to persuade the life committee that there was a reasonable proposition to release him, but they did what they always do, they consulted the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge. Lord Salmon sent back a reply saying that under no circumstances ought this man to be released because in his view this was one of the most dangerous men he had ever had to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That judgment was given after a day-and-a-half in court, but, coming from the trial judge—and particularly a judge of such distinction—it inevitably had an effect upon the life committee and certainly upon Ministers and so he was put off for another two or three years. His case came up again and the same experience happened again. He came up yet again some time afterwards, and the same experience happened again. By that time everybody—the local review committees, the prison authorities, the psychiatrist^—who had anything to do with this man said that he ought to be released because by that time it was perfectly plain that he would not be a danger to the public and that he might very well deteriorate if he remained in prison any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the time I came along, that man had been in prison for 14 years, at least six years more than the authorities thought was appropriate, given
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the man. The only reason why he was kept there was because the judge was irrevocably committed to the view that the man ought to remain there forever, but he formed that conclusion simply upon one-and-a-half days in court during which the man could have given evidence for only a short time. Lord Salmon's judgment was based not on the evidence, but simply from watching him in the dock. This had to be pitted against the professional advice of psychiatrists, prison officers, prison governors and the rest for a period of many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a totally inappropriate situation and something had to be done to resolve it. We askd Lord Salmon to come to a committee with everyone concerned in order to give his views. At the end he refused. The Lord Chief Justice came and the committee decided to release the man. He was released. He has now been out for six or seven years and no one has suggested that he has got into trouble since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the proper way to approach a situation like that? If the judge had sentenced him, there is little doubt he would have sentenced him for a very long period of time, yet this would have been wrcng in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to take the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) that it is to be left to the judiciary, it is highly likely that the judiciary acting at the moment when the feelings of horror about the death are at their highest, would be much more likely to give a longer than a shorter period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall), the train robbers got 30 years at a time when a sort of competition was going on with the judiciary. I say that advisedly, because I was once at a mess with a judge on the North-Eastern circuit where they were talking about the period being upped from a 19-year sentence, which was the longest that had been given by any judge at that stage, to something higher. In the court of that assize it went up to something like 22. Ultimately it got to 30 in the case of the train robbers. At the time it looked as if it might remain for some time. Then the Court of Appeal, headed by Lord Justice Lawton, who is no slouch about sentencing, decided that, in view of the fact that life sentences for murder did not normally extend at that time beyond an average of 12 years—although there are plenty of cases where it goes much higher—it was appropriate to bring down the length of sentence for other offences to a maximum of 15 years, because otherwise there would not be a proper disparity between the level of sentencing for murder and that elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was because the Home Office had been able to keep a rein on the length of sentence for murder. In that situation, supposing the judges were to have complete discretion to give higher sentencing, there is a real chance that the level of sentencing might go up again. My hon. Friend and I would certainly

contest that, but hon. Members might take a different view. In those circumstances, we have to decide what is likely to lead to the best result. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend; there are plenty of cases of murder that would not merit a very long period of imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that the first case that followed the Homicide Act 1957, which retained capital sentence for murder in the course of theft, was that of a burglar who had got into a warehouse and had been disturbed by the watchman. As he heard the watchman coming up the steps to the floor on which he was, he dashed out panic-stricken and tried to get away. He saw the watchman on the steps and pushed him out of the way. The watchman fell down the steps and was killed. The jury decided that that was with sufficient intent to come within the bounds of murder and that therefore he was guilty. That man was hanged because it was the first case after the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a situation like that I do not believe that the gravity of the offence, the degree of intent, was such that it warranted a very long prison sentence. I would have put it lower than the average. I agree with my hon. Friend that in those circumstances a judge would probably have given him a fairly low sentence. What worries me is the kind of sentence that would be given at the higher end of the scale and, indeed, the average. I suspect that the average would go up—and if the average went up for murder I suspect that it would pull the average up for other offences too. In those circumstances I regret I cannot follow my hon. Friend in his proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has not been troubled by my observations for some two weeks now and I have noticed how rapidly it has gone through its work in the meantime, so I will do my best not to slow down the rate of progress too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I find my preliminary ideas on penal matters at variance with those of my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), I automatically think very hard as to whether those preliminary ideas are right or wrong, and I have certainly done so in this case because he raised a very important issue, an issue moreover that both he and my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) have said can very reasonably be decided on in either direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is right perhaps to go back a little and look at the way in which the present law came into being. I can do so perhaps with greater knowledge by reason of the fact that I took a very prominent part in the proceedings of the Sydney Silverman Bill, and particularly in relation to the clause which eventually became that which dealt with the life sentence and the recommendation. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk that it was a compromise. I am sure that I will accept his adjective an " unhappy' compromise. It was a compromise, I think for the reason that those who were in favour of the law being as my hon. Friend now suggests it ought to be were, on the whole, the hard-
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
liners, and the fear was that they were advancing the view that there should be a determinate sentence in the hope and belief that in many cases of murder a sentence equivalent to, or even greater than, that passed in the train robbers' case would be passed by the judiciary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I, in relation to the train robbers, say in fairness to Lord Edmund-Davies, who tried that case and whom I got to know very well because we were fellow members of the Royal Commission on the Penal System, that I came to recognise and admire the liberal nature of his views. I think he took a special line on that case because he felt that his duty was to do his best to ensure that the vast amount of money which had not been recovered would not be available for the benefit of those who had taken part in the robbery. That, I think, was the predominant factor in his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a very special case. But those who felt that it would be quite wrong that people should be sentenced to excessively long terms of imprisonment were faced with the difficulty that, if one produced a form of words such as my hon. Friend is now producing, that could well be the result, and the compromise eventually arrived at was that we would retain the mandatory life sentence but would enable the judge to make a recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look at the position in retrospect 16 years or thereabouts later, I cannot see that the system has worked badly. It has worked in practice a good deal better than I expected it to at the time. There are today many learned judges who deliberately do not exercise their power to recommend because they feel, as my hon. Friend the Member for York said, that the moment of sentencing immediately after a trial is very often not the best moment at which the whole future of an offender, even in the case of this very grave crime, should be virtually decided. I should be interested to hear from the Minister how frequently in the past few years the power to recommend has been used. I suspect that it has been used much less frequently than in earlier days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The life sentence in effect is an indeterminate sentence which recognises the public attitude towards murder and at the same time recognises that those who are experienced and knowledgeable about cases which find their Way to court know that there is an infinite variety in reality between the extremes of the types of murder that are committed. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for York said, a high proportion of them are in the category of the family-type murder, the type of murder which is not carefully thought out and planned or part of a scheme of robbery, for example, but is committed very much on the impulse of the moment and dictated by circumstances in which any one of us, however calm in the ordinary way we may be, could find himself stirred to anger within the family, when somebody goes too far. That kind of offence is one which I think nobody here would think should be treated in the same category as the deliberate planned murder as part of robbery, for example.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
The weight of opinion of prison officers and governors whom I have met is that those who commit that type of murder and who have no other criminal record are very often the best type of prisoner with the best chance of leading an honest and honourable life thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question really is whether the system which we have impels the Home Office in such cases to keep a person in custody for longer, or substantially longer, than is justified, in taking into account the gravity of the offence of murder and the proper desire that a person should be released at the moment before keeping him in for a longer time would cause a deterioration which would be likely to criminalise him for the future.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there will be cases, such as that referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for York, where this may happen. I have come across cases where I have felt that an unduly cautious view has been take, and not having the benefit of my hon. Friend's knowledge from within the Home Office, I have often wondered what the reason has been. I imagine that many of us have had that exeprience, when we have taken up cases on behalf of constituents and we have not been able to find out precisely why licence has been refused, in cases where it seemed to us from what we had heard that the time had certainly arrived when licence should be granted. There have been cases in my experience where a licence has been revoked on grounds that I find difficult to understand. We must always keep in the back of our minds that in those cases there may be factors which the Home Office knows about and is not able to reveal, which may affect the reasoning. The type of factor to which my hon. Friend referred, when the learned judge expresses a strong view, may be one of them. The view of the trial judge possibly 10 or more years after the event shall be of much reduced importance. The view of the current Lord Chief Justice, in considering the case as a whole with objective eyes, not having taken part in the trial itself, is surely far more valuable than the recollection of the judge who happened to try the case. The trial may have taken place many years before and the trial judge's only recollection may be an impression that he gained at the time. That may guide his subsequent recommendation rather than an objective assessment of the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our laws have developed in the direction of trying to find ways of ensuring that people are not convicted of murder if there are mitigating circumstances that enable them to be convicted of lesser offences such as manslaughter or infanticide. With manslaughter we created the concept of diminished responsibility in the context of homicide legislation. We already have the concept of provocation. It would be well worth a Home Office study again considering the offence of murder to see whether we can go even further in opening up areas in which manslaughter could be the appropriate offence rather than murder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
I recall in particular one of the cases with which I was concerned when I was Attorney-General. It was a Northern Ireland reference to the House of Lords and where the defendant was acquitted. It was a reported case so I can freely mention the circumstances without mentioning any names. A young soldier was asked with others to look for terrorists in a country area. He asked a young man who was shambling past him to stop and the young man did not do so. The soldier blew him to pieces through the back at point-blank range. Unhappily the soldier believed that because the young man was shambling away he was probably a member or supporter of the IRA who wanted to inform others of the presence of a platoon of soldiers. In fact, he was a mentally subnormal agricultural labourer who had no connection with the IRA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was an extraordinarily unfortunate and tragic case and one which undoubtedly did the image of the British Army no good in that part of the world. As I said, the soldier was acquitted. He was acquitted because he had a reasonable belief that the man was a terrorist. That may have been a somewhat merciful view, but at the same time, whatever view one takes about that, the soldier was plainly disobeying orders. He disobeyed all the requirements of the yellow card. I argued that in such circumstances a court could convict of the lesser offence of manslaughter rather than of murder. However, their Lordships held that the law had not gone that far, and that it was either murder or nothing. That was an impossible dilemma in which to place a court, which might well consider that the soldier had been blameworthy but that to convict him of murder in the circumstances would be going beyond what was reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that that is not the only type of case where one should consider not so much the penalty as the offence itself. I hope that the Home Office will consider that the time has come to examine the offence. I am not suggesting the American system of first and second-degree murders. We have the offence of manslaughter and I see no reason why that offence, which carries a maximum penalty which is the same as the mandatory penalty for murder, though it is normally treated as something less serious, should not be extended to cover a number of cases where there are strongly mitigating circumstances, I hope that that issue will be considered by the Home Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might it not be possible to go some way towards meeting my right hon. and learned Friend's view if the defence of provocation were altered so that the cooling-off period was not a crucial element? Frequently provocation is a mitigating circumstance, but the cooling-off period restricts the operation of the defence to a point where the accused is convicted of murder when he should not really be convicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. That is only one of the areas in which we should emphasise that manslaughter could be a more reasonable alternative to murder. At the moment, it is murder or nothing. Provocation is one area that is too tightly defined at the moment, but there are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
others. The studies that I made of this subject in connection with the reference to the House of Lords convinced me, because of the way this has developed historically, that there is a great lack of good logic and good sense and that the whole area of law should be brought more into conformity with modern ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that perhaps that still would not deal with the family-type murder, although it might conceivably deal with the example that my hon. Friend referred to earlier about the man who almost accidentally caused somebody else's death, where again we might have the difficulty that it is either murder or nothing. It is a question then very much of the sympathy of the court, which might extend more reasonably to a soldier on duty than to others. I find it difficult to see how we can deal with the family-type murder other than by a system of first and second degree murder, which would leave an enormous discretion to the judge, and one which I think the judges would not be very keen to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we adopted the solution that my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk has suggested, we would be putting the judges in the invidious position of having to set a sort of tariff for different types of murder. With all respect to the late Lord Chief Justice, I think that most of them would not wish to accept that position. That is an area where it would be much better to leave the prison authorities and the Home Office with plenty of time to consider objectively and coolly both the person and the offence, and then to decide, quite courageously, wherever it may be necessary to do so, in whether a very short term would be adequate and would meet the public's revulsion while, at the same time doing justice to the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My trust in the judges and the judiciary may be somewhat greater than that of some of my hon. Friends. However, it would be very difficult indeed for a judge in the immediate aftermath of a conviction for murder, however much he may feel that there are mitigating circumstances of a family character, for example, to take out of his mind altogether the public's reaction if he were to pass a sentence of two or three years' imprisonment. In those circumstances it would require an exteremely brave judge to do that. I do not want to wish that task upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, while accepting a great deal of the logic of the arguments that have been advanced in support of the new clause, I find myself compelled to come down against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a measure of the non-party and thoughtful nature of our proceedings that the interesting and valuable debate that we have had on the new clause has taken place wholly on the Opposition side of the Committee. The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) moved the new clause with much thoughtfulness and with the benefit of great experience in these matters. As it happens, his right hon. and hon. Friends have all been against him. I shall not reply at great length
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
because so much of what I wished to say in response to the new clause has been said in varying ways by each of those who have spoken—the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) and the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), who spoke as a former Law Officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone is agreed that we must regard murder as an offence of unique gravity, and that is common to all the speeches that have been made so far today. I am certain that we must continue to take that view, and I agree with what was said by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington that the public's abhorrence of murder is so great that there is a need for a unique sentence to reflect it. Equally, I agree that there must be provision in our arrangements for the subsequent development of the prisoner, as the years go by in custody, to be taken into account, so that a time may be identified when the justice of the case can be met, together with justice being done to the prisoner himself by authorising release on licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the merit, as it seems to the Government, of our present arrangements. The unique quality of the offence of murder is recognised by a unique sentence—it is the only mandatory sentence of imprisonment and it is a sentence of life imprisonment —but at the same time there is a carefully developed system that ensures that a case is reviewed at regular intervals. The issue is then brought to the Home Secretary of the day for him to decide whether licence for release should be granted. That is the virtue of the two-limbed system, if one may put it like that. We believe that that system should be retained because of the uniquely serious nature of the offence and because those convicted of it, are those whose murderous intent and full responsibility for the act have been established. They include offenders who may be likely to kill again. Only the mandatory life sentence, apart from a mandatory death penalty which it replaced, offers the public adequate protection. The present arrangements for discretionary licence, subject to a recommendation by the Parole Board on whether and when to authorise release on licence, have worked well and with a degree of flexibility and consistency which would not have been achieved if the penalty had been at the courts' discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all agree that the protection of the public must be of paramount concern. The judge at the time of the sentence cannot predict with any great degree of certainty whether the convicted murderer poses a future threat. I agree with what has been said by the hon. Member for York and the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich that, the pressure of public opinion at the time of trial, and the freshness of the horrific event which has led to the prosecution and conviction, means that it is likely that a judge would impose a heavy, determinate sentence if he had the discretion to pass a determinate sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being the case, many years will be spent in prison. That is one side of the matter. Another side is that, when those years are completed, there will be no supervision in the community, no power
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
to recall, as there is when a murderer is released on licence. Nobody, having been convicted of murder under our present arrangements, is ever discharged from his licence. He is on licence, and that continues for the rest of his life. That is what is meant by a life sentence. That, however, would not be available were a determinate sentence to be passed, with remission if it is earned for good conduct. That man or woman is released, and then neither the court nor the Home Secretary has any power to recall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must acknowledge a lessening in the power to protect the public that our present arrangements give. The power to recall somebody who is on licence in the community as a convicted murderer is by no means a dead letter. It is not infrequently exercised, and among the circumstances in which it is exercised is certainly any development of behaviour that suggests that the risk of re-offending, to the danger of the public, has become greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. and learned Friend enlighten me, if not the rest of the Committee, on what mechanisms are used to ensure that the supervision implied in this licence procedure is watertight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not sure what my hon. Friend means by " watertight", but when somebody is licensed, he is licensed into the community but is subject to supervision of a degree that varies according to the circumstances of the case. In some circumstances it may with the passage of time become very light and lifted altogether. In other circumstances it may be retained at a fairly intense level. What matters is that at no time is he released from the obligations of licence, and at no time does the Home Secretary become deprived of his power, if so advised, to recall to custody. If he is recalled to custody, the matter has to be referred to the Parole Board. That safeguard exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, then, an important advantage of our present arrangements, over and above the advantage that it gives the Home Secretary the opportunity in consultation, as has been said, with the Lord Chief Justice, and with the trial judge if he is available, to review the progress made in prison and to see whether the time has come when, consistently with the safety of the public and with the need to fulfill the function of punishment inherent in the sentence, the prisoner may be released on licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I wanted to> say in addition to what has been said in the speeches so far. The debate brings into focus the situation that would obtain if determinate sentences were available for murder. Even if all the indications were that the prisoner serving a determinate sentence for murder presented a significant further threat to the public, he would nevertheless have to be released at the end of his sentence, and if the Parole Board did not recommend early release on parole, the prisoner would not be subject to any supervision in the community at all, even for a limited period. We ought not seriously to contemplate that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
It can, of course, be argued that, if the courts were given discretion the worst murderers would still be sentenced to life imprisonment. It might also be the case that very long determinate sentences, of 30 or 40 years, would be passed to ensure that the prisoner was not released too soon. In the words of the Criminal Law Revision Committee,
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is uncertain what sentencing pattern would emerge, and that the adoption of discretionary sentencing for murder would be a leap in the dark."</p></blockquote>
The Criminal Law Revision Committee was virtually evenly divided in its most recent fourteenth Report. It said that it was not, therefore, in a position to recommend any change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) said when introducing the new clause, that we are fortunate to have the report of the CLRC which very fairly sets out both sides. It is important to note that it felt itself unable to come to a recommendation. We have the long-established system' that I have described of life sentences plus the flexible arrangements for release on licence, subject to safeguards against the capricious use of that discretion—the requirements for consultation and so forth—where the Home Secretary is unable to release on licence unless the Parole Board agrees that that would be appropriate, but where equally the Home Secretary is not obliged to release on licence notwithstanding that the Parole Board would think that it was appropriate. Where we have this long-established system, which works pretty well, I think that is common ground. We would be rash to depart from it in the radical way suggested in the new clause, especially when the Criminal Law Revision Committee is so evenly divided on this and is unable to make a recommendation one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman suggested that we should look further at the possibility of developing the law of murder, so that there should be less need—I think that was how he put it—for courts to exercise feelings of sympathy in favour of an accused person in a case where perhaps the strict interpretation of the law required a conviction but where the circumstances of the case inclined juries strongly towards acquitting for the offence of murder as it is at present defined by the law. He said that we had developed the law on manslaughter on the grounds of diminshed responsibility and so on, and we will look carefully at what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said in that passage of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to my starting point, I think we are all agreed that the offence of murder is of so heinous a quality that a unique sentence is required. I do not believe that it would be right to invest the judges with the discretion, whether they would like it or not, to determine what is the right term, of imprisonment to be served. I do not think that that would provide equal protection to the public, for the reasons that I have sought to give. I agree that it might well have the consequences mentioned by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) of hoisting up the tariff generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
Although I appreciate the great weight of informed opinion that the hon. Member for Ormskirk can rely upon in support of the new clause, I do not feel that I can recommend to the Committee that we ought to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My new clause does not seek to preclude the possibility of a life sentence being imposed for murder. It simply seeks to give the courts a discretion. The new clause was moved in the knowledge that many of those who commit murder are not in the accepted sense of the word criminals. That is to say, they are not people who embark on premeditated and calculated crime. They are not a danger to the public. They are not even likely to re-offend, let alone commit another offence of murder, yet they are subject to a mandatory life sentence, even though the circumstances in which they committed the crime are probably wholly exceptional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The murder may have been committed at a moment of great emotional disturbance and stress, —yet at the same time a persistent, armed bank robber, who embarks upon a calculated, deliberate and cold-blooded crime, who is a danger to the public and who will commit further offences, not least upon release, is not subject to the same mandatory sentence. It seems to be unreasonable and unfair in those circumstances.

Unless I am tempted by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark), I shall not detain the Committee by attempting to answer the arguments that have been deployed against me. Some of them are answerable, not least several of those advanced by the Minister, some of which I regard as specious, but I am profoundly influenced by what my hon. Friends have had to say, not least my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin). I was influenced by his arguments, but, of course, I am even more influenced by the fact that not one member of the Committee is supporting me, and in those circumstances I can do not other than beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause would reverse the decision of the Divisional Court in 1980 in what has become known as the Nottingham Justices case. This was a test
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
case brought by a group of Nottingham solicitors who wished to challenge a policy decision made by the Nottingham magistrates that, on or after a defendant's third successive application for bail, they would refuse to hear arguments in support of a bail application unless there were new circumstances since the last remand hearing. The Divisional Court held in that case that the practice of the Nottingham magistrates was correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Committee will be aware, the Bail Act 1976 provides that a defendant should be granted bail unless one of the exceptions in schedule 1 of the Act applies—namely, that if granted bail he is likely either to abscond, commit offences, interfere with witnesses, or otherwise in some way obstruct the course of justice. In the Nottingham Justices case, Lord Justice Donaldson said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court will have been under an obligation to grant bail unless it was satisfied that a Schedule 1 exception was made out … on the next occasion when bail is considered the court should treat as an essential fact, that at the time when the matter of bail was last considered, Schedule 1 circumstances did indeed exist. Strictly speaking, they can and should only investigate whether that situation has changed since then."</p></blockquote>
In a recent article in the 	<i>Criminal Law Review 1981,</i> Mrs. Mary Hayes, a law lecturer at Sheffield University—herself a magistrate—pointed out that the decision of a court in a remand hearing is far from being a straightforward finding of fact. She said, on page 22:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court does not make a finding about what the accused has done, it makes a prediction about what the accused may do—that is, he will fail to surrender to custody, or will commit an offence while on bail or will interfere with witnesses … These grounds embrace objective facts and a subjective evaluation of the facts."</p></blockquote>
As we know, bail decisions are a subjective and evaluative exercise. They inevitably involve an element of informed guesswork as to whether the defendant is likely to turn up in court or whether he is likely to commit a further offence or whether he is likely to obstruct the course of justice, and so on. One set of magistrates is just as likely to reach a different decision than three of their colleagues sitting on a case in similar circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the effect of the Nottingham Justices decision is that some defendants who might have been granted bail on a third or subsequent appearance cannot now be considered for bail and that, I submit, is contrary to Parliament's intention in providing for remand hearings to take place every eight days, presumably on the assumption that circumstances can change, that these circumstances should be taken into account and that the opportunity should exist for a defendant to be able to make an application on successive separate occasions for an end of the remand in custody and, therefore, for bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that new clause 42, which I have supported, will end the personal appearance at remand hearings of every eight days but that is a very different principle from the Nottingham Justices case. New clause 42 only applies if the defendants actually choose to waive their rights to a personal appearance at a remand hearing. The Nottingham
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
Justices decision on the other hand denies a defendant the right to have his case for bail considered whether he wants it considered or not. As Alec Samuels, a law lecturer at Southampton University who is also a magistrate, wrote in the "New Law Journal " on 5 February 1981:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The idea that the decision of three lay magistrates, or indeed one stipendiary magistrate, taken last week in the course of a few minutes hearing in all the bustle of the remands court, should be binding for the future on another court, similarly constituted, hearing the matter next week, is truly astonishing, not to say ludicrous... Magistrates should decide each and every case as it comes before them, on its merits, without regard to the sensitivity, vanity or reaction of colleagues who were involved in the matter previously."</p></blockquote>
This is not to say that magistrates should take no notice of their own previous decisions or those of their colleagues. In practice, where the evidence presented to a court is much the same as that presented on an earlier occasion, magistrates will not lightly depart from their colleagues' decision, nor would one expect them to depart from that decision. However, as David Roberts, a Bristol solicitor, pointed out in the "Guardian Gazette", the weekly journal of the Law Society, on 25 November 1981:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every solicitor experienced in magistrates' court practice knows how the strength of a bail application can change subtly over a period of several weeks, that new factors arise, not very significant in themselves, which can make the third or fourth application significantly different from earlier ones, and yet he knows that it is very difficult to make a convincing case as to the significance of the difference. Similarly, the attitude of the prosecution to bail undergoes subtle changes. As police enquiries proceed, the objections to bail can be seen in a different light from the initial review, perhaps not sufficient to persuade the prosecution not to oppose bail, but sufficient to produce a significant change of response to a later application. If, as now, the later application cannot be made, the slight changes in the prosecution attitude remain unexpressed."</p></blockquote>
The position after the Nottingham Justices case— and the decision of the Divisional court is that even if the earlier decision was a bad one, for example, because the evidence was misunderstood, or because the reasons for refusal of bail were not justified by the evidence—if those two circumstances exist, the decision cannot be reconsidered by a later court. That, I submit, would be less disturbing if we had a satisfactory system for reviewing magistrates' bail decisions. But, as I will argue in moving new clause 24, it is widely accepted that the system of applying for bail to a High Court judge in chambers is grossly unsatisfactory except for the minority of remand prisoners who can afford to pay for private legal representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in some cases the Nottingham Justices decision will result in a saving of court time. But, as Alec Samuels wrote in the article in the " New Law Journal" that I have already referred to earlier:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a robust court should be able to control its proceedings to get fairly but expeditiously through bail applications, to shorten the prolix advocate, to express displeasure at hopeless application, to curb abuse, but nonetheless still to consider the matter on its merits."</p></blockquote>
The Nottingham Justices case has made serious inroads into the rights of defendants to be considered
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
for bail. This new clause, by reversing the effects of that decision, would help to ensure that defendants are not detained unnecessarily in prison where the courts would have granted them bail if they had been allowed to consider the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will look favourably on this new clause and be able to give the Committee an assurance that if he is not for some reasonable to accept it today, he certainly applauds and supports the principle behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's new clause. There are two aspects of the matter, first, the interests of the defendant and, secondly, the interests of the public in not having the prisons cluttered up with people who need not be there. This is an aspect which again and again in the courts we have been considering. It applies particularly to persons who can justifiably be on bail, but are kept in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the interests of the individual are concerned, the philosophy of the Bail Act, which I strongly supported at the time and since, was that there should be at all times a presumtion in favour of bail, and that presumption should not vary from day to day or from week to week so that at times they cannot win and the presumption may be said to be out of date and goes the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause is to ensure that at all times the presumption does remain a genuine and valid one, so that the court may on each occasion look at the matter with open eyes and completely objectively in order to see whether at that time it is unsafe to allow bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has given expression to the circumstance that it might well apply. I should like to put forward another one which is within the experience of those of us who practise the law in the courts. This is the circumstance where at some time in the preparations for trial a defendant decides that the time has come when he ought to have legal representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that, prior to that, he either has not tried to put his case or even considered the points that are likely to be in the mind of a court when it decides whether bail should be granted. Then he comes legally represented and those who have the knowledge and experience of the facts that weigh with him look into his case and come to the conclusion that there are factors that have not been advanced on his behalf which could be forcibly advanced, given the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even those of us who are not lawyers but who must carry out our ordinary constituency duties on behalf of our constituencies know how often this is the case. We find in our own experience that by questioning the constituent we discover factors that have not been advanced that may have a material bearing on the decision of the authority which has been refusing relief to our constituent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly the same applies in the case of more legal representation. One of the primary functions of the representatives is not so much, as I have said before, the advocacy in court as discovering the relevant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
factors in the preparation of the case. Often, success is achieved as a result of doing this on the basis of a factor which has never been in the mind of the court before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that the terms of the new clause merely seek to restore Parliament's intention that bail and presumption in favour of bail was at all times the operative presumption. I wholeheartedly support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the new clause. Like my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), I shall put my arguments very briefly. There is no doubt that the decision in the Nottingham justices case has resulted in serious inroads into the whole philosophy behind the Bail Act 1976, and equally that it has seriously undermined the presumption in favour of bail, which was thought to be established and was intended to be so by the 1976 Act. One of the reasons why I argued so strongly in favour of the retention of the present eight-day remand period—I can assure you, Mr. Dean, that I shall not go over those arguments again—was that it gives the remanded prisoner an opportunity to apply for bail every eight days, and to ensure that his counsel who is making the application does so adequately, and properly represents his views and the circumstances that he wishes to be put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His presence at the remand hearing equally ensures that some spurious or unsubstantiated reason that may be put forward by the prosecution, which may have been transmitted to the prosecution third-hand, upon which the prosecution has no direct evidence, can be challenged. Without the accused's being there it frequently cannot be challenged, because the defending solicitor himself may have no first-hand knowledge of those particular facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the eight-day provision in clause 42 a serious inroad into the rights of the individual to apply for bail, in my view—although I do not necessarily take my hon. Friends with me—but the decision of the Nottingham justices compounds the felony. Now, once a Bench has decided, that decision has to be upheld. Once a Bench has decided not to grant bail, that decision is unchallengeable. It is sacrosanct, unless there are new circumstances to present to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That decision may be fine. The idea that one court should bind another may be legally acceptable, if the decision of the court has been reached on firm principles and rules of evidence. But that is not the case in bail application. Sworn evidence is rarely given, as anybody who has made a bail application will know. As I have said before, in many cases the decision is taken on the basis of something which the prosecution solicitor has put forward and which strikes the ear of the Bench. The standards of proof which are required in other matters …
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standards of proof which are required in other matters, certainly in the matter of whether a person is guilty or not, do not maintain in case of
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
bail decisions because the Bench need only be satisfied that specified reasons exist to refuse bail. There is no " beyond reasonable doubt" or the " balance of probabilities " or anything of that sort, merely that the Bench need be satisfied. One Bench merely being satisfied without having to consider sworn evidence or without having to adhere to standards of evidence, and proof seems to me to be unacceptable. It is quite wrong that a Bench which comes to a decision in that way should bind all future Benches considering that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the charms and strengths of the system of lay magistrates always put forward is that different Benches are sufficiently robust to be able to take different decisions from their colleagues sitting on another Bench. That seems to me to be a very good argument in favour of the independent minded-ness and the abilities of Benches. However, that apparently is no longer to be the case. One Bench, whatever its attitude may be to bail, and however different a decision it may have reached on exactly the same circumstances, is now to be denied the use of that independent decision, and, furthermore, without an adequate right of appeal existing for the person who has been turned down for bail. I applaud my hon. Friend for Ormskirk for putting down a new clause to give those who have been refused bail a proper right of appeal to the Crown court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the circumstances it seems to me, as my right hon. and learned Friend has said, that all this new clause does is to put the position back to what it was and was always considered to be as a result of the Bail Act. It is not altering the law in any way. It reverts to the spirit of that Act—what everybody considered that Act did. In my view, particularly having regard to the Government's change over the necessity for the accused to appear in person every eight days. I hope the Government will feel able to accept this very modest but nonetheless important new clause as far as the liberty of the subject is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Magistrates' Court Act 1980, in section 128 provides that a migstrates' court where it has power to remand a person may, subject to the provisions of the Bail Act of 1976, remand him in custody or on bail. Section 4 of the Bail Act applies to three categories:

Subsection (2) applies to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person who is accused of an offence when—

Subsection (3) applies to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person who, having been convicted of an offence, appears or is brought before a magistrates' court to be dealt with "—</p></blockquote>
for—

	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
but remanded for
	<br><blockquote><p>"inquiries or a report to be made to assist the court in dealing with him for the offence."</p></blockquote>
The section provides that such defendants have a right to bail unless reasons specified in the Act exist for refusing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Nottingham Justices case, the Divisional Court presided over by Lord Justice Donaldson took the view that the starting point for the consideration of bail in the case of a magistrates' court must always be the finding of the position when the matter was last considered by the court. I emphasise the words, " the starting point"; not the beginning and the end, and that the court can investigate only whether the situation has changed since the last remand in custody. However, the court in considering afresh the question of bail, is both entitled and bound to take account not only of a change in circumstances which has occurred since the last occasion, but of circumstances which, although they then existed, were not brought to the attention of the court. In practice, this means that a court, having inquired once fully into all the circumstances, need not make a further full inquiry unless there is a change in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the points made by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) and the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) have not fully taken into account the width of what was said by Lord Justice Donaldson giving the judgment of the court. It is worth emphasising that he said that the court was bound to take account not only of a change in the circumstances that may have occurred since the last hearing by the magistrates, but of circumstances which although they then existed had not been brought to the attention of the court. That bears upon the circumstances that were envisaged by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington, that on the occasion of a subsequent hearing a solicitor may have realised that the case put forward for bail is fuller than at first was made known to him, or similar circumstances of that kind. That is envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall risk detaining the Committee for a few minutes, and read a passage from the judgment. Lord Justice Donaldson said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Finally, I accept that the fact that a bench of the same or a different constitution has decided on a previous occasion or occasions that one or more of the Schedule 1 exceptions applies and has accordingly remanded the accused in custody does not absolve the bench on each subsequent occasion from considering whether the accused is entitled to bail, whether or not an application is made."</p></blockquote>
That bears upon the question not only of whether an application is made for bail, but the points that have been made in our short debate today on what will arise when somebody, having given his consent and been represented legally, does not need to be brought before the court more often than once every 28 days, or thereabouts. The important point arising from what I have just read is that, notwithstanding that an application for bail has not been made, the court is not absolved from considering whether the acused is entitled to bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
Lord Justice Donaldson went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However this does not mean that the justices should ignore their own previous decision or a previous decision of their colleagues. Far from it. On those previous occasions, the court will have been under an obligation to grant bail unless it was satisfied that a Sch 1 exception was made out. If it was so satisfied, it will have recorded the exceptions which in its judgment were applicable. This ' satisfaction' is not a personal intellectual conclusion by each justice. It is a finding by the court that Sch 1 circumstances then existed and is to be treated like every other finding of the court. It is res judicata or analogous thereto. It stands as a finding unless and until it is overturned	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --> on appeal. And appeal is not to the same court, whether or not of the same constitution, on a later occasion. It is to the judge in chambers. It follows that on the next occasion when bail is considered the court should treat, as an essential fact, that at the time when the matter of bail was last considered, Sch 1 circumstances did indeed exist. Strictly speaking, they can and should only investigate whether that situation has changed since then."</p></blockquote>
The matter is not as stark as was indicated by the hon. Member for Ormskirk. Lord Justice Donaldson also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will always be a possibility that there has been a change, because more time will have elapsed. For example, the ability to interfere with witnesses diminishes as police inquiries progress and statements have been taken."</p></blockquote>
I am reciting only the relevant parts of what was said—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Furthermore … it is well established that it is a proper exercise of judicial discretion to decide that the prosecution has unreasonably delayed."</p></blockquote>
The question is a little wider than whether there has been a change. The question is "Are there any new considerations which were not before the court when the accused was last remanded in custody? "
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nottingham justices case precluded the right, hitherto thought to have existed, to come back every eight days week after week with precisely the same grounds for one's application for bail to one court or another with the purpose perhaps of playing off one court against another and in the end pursuading one court on precisely the same facts to say " Very well we believe that schedule 1 exceptions do not exist and therefore we grant bail." That was seen to be an abuse, it was extensive and it was an abuse. Though the court in the Nottingham justices case was only interpreting the existing statute it gives grounds for supporting the law as the Nottingham justices case proclaimed it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have shown that it does not, and is not intended, to preclude any genuine change of circumstance, including one deriving from the mere passage of time, from being considered by the court nor is the court precluded from being
	<br><blockquote><p>"absolved from considering whether the accused is entitled on each occasion to bail whether or not an application is made."</p></blockquote>
It is important that we acknowledge the virtue of that interpretation of the law in that it enables magistrates to be relieved from the week by week by week application on precisely the same grounds. It is right, however, that we should bear in mind
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
the provisions of new clause 24. The Lord Chancellor's Department has been considering new clause 24. Speaking for my own part, I hope that it may be possible to agree to accepting at least its principle. The sum of money likely to be required for the legal aid involved is estimated to be less than £1 million a year. The Lord Chancellor's Department estimates that if new clause 10 were accepted so that repeated applications for bail become possible, the legal aid costs would be likely to be greater than £1 million. In financial terms we cannot have both new clauses. Provision of an avenue of appeal to the Crown Court, which does not exist at the moment, has clear advantages over any provision to set aside the Nottingham justices' judgment, for reasons which I have explained. It would be cheaper. It would not involve courts of the same rank being played off one against the other. It would provide an avenue of application to a higher court. In itself that could lead, one would hope, to a more satisfactory conclusion of some bail decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C.

<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that an appeal to the Crown Court, which would be a rehearing, is to be seen as over-lapping exactly the provisions of the clause.

In other words considerations can be put before the court which were not before you at your last hearing ". Lord Justice Donaldson's judgment in the parts that I have referred to shows that it is possible to go back and do that. What one cannot do is on the same facts meet the same case week after week. This is applied by the courts in a sensible way, but I thought it helpful, not wishing to anticipate new clause 24 which we shall come to later, to say that my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor and my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause reduces the maximum periods of imprisonment which the Crown Court can impose for fine default to the same levels as those which a magistrates' court can impose for failing to pay a fine of a similar amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1977 the Criminal Law Act reduced the maximum periods of imprisonment which magistrates can impose for fine default. Section 59 laid down a
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
scale of maxima which was later consolidated in schedule 4 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. According to this scale, magistrates' courts may impose up to seven days' imprisonment for failing to pay a fine of up to £25: and up to 14 days' imprisonment for failing to pay a fine of between £25 and £50. There is then a graduated scale up to a maximum of 12 months' imprisonment for failing to pay a fine exceeding £5,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effects of this reduction in the maxima in the Criminal Law Act were striking. It resulted, first in a marked reduction in the average length of sentence served by fine defaulters. For example, in the two years up to September 1977, when the new scale of maxima came into force, only about 40 per cent, of those received into prison for fine default had been sentenced to terms of one month or less; but ever since then the proportion of fine defaulters serving one month or less has been consistently over 70 per cent, of those received into prison. In consequence, although the number of fine defaulters received into prison has continued to rise, the average daily number in prison has fallen. For instance, on 30 June 1976 the number was 1,123, and on 30 June 1977 it was 1,069. This fell to 826 on 30 June 1978, 889 on the same date in 1979 and 892 on 30 June 1980. This shows a striking and significant reduction in the daily average prison population of fine defaulters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the maxima laid down in the Criminal Law Act, and now contained in the Magistrates' Courts Act, do not apply to fines imposed by the Crown court. Although fines imposed by the Crown court are enforced by magistrates' courts, the period of imprisonment for default is fixed by the Crown court at the time it imposes the fine. The only statutory restriction on the length of such periods is an overall maximum of 12 months. According to the NACRO working party on fine default, chaired by Lady Howe, in a report published last year
	<br><blockquote><p>"In practice, the size of fines and default terms imposed by the Crown Court often far exceed the maximum specified for magistrates' courts' fines."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that is both illogical and unjust, There is no reason why someone who has failed to pay a fine of, say, £100 imposed by a Crown court should be liable to anything up to 12 months' imprisonment, when if he had been fined precisely the same amount by a magistrates' court he could not be imprisoned for more than 30 days. This results in defaulters fined by Crown courts serving unnecessarily long terms in prison, with all the resultant waste of the prison service's resources which that involves, as well as the injustice to the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would remedy that source of injustice and would make a modest but, I submit, a useful contribution to reducing the average daily population of local prisons. I hope that the Minister will feel able—given the more charitable and receptive mood that he has exhibited so far this morning—to indicate to the Committee that he will accept the spirit, the practice and the intent of new clause 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was wrong when he said that in his announcing his decisions, either openly or sometimes sotto voce, we would be unappreciative. Since there is an indication that my hon. Friend's arguments have been so persuasive that the Minister has decided to accept the new clause, it only remains for me to support my hon. Friend's very convincing arguments, which I feel are so convincing that the Minister cannot fail to accept the proposal. In anticipation of that I will say no more, other than to urge him to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a most attractive atmosphere and I am very happy to respond. The chairman of NACRO, Lady Howe, and other members of that body came to see me towards the end of last year to discuss their very impressive report and we had a useful discussion on this matter of the remedy for fine default. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) for suggesting this helpful amendment to the provisions relating to sentences for fine default. As he rightly said, the Crown court is subject only to a general maximum of 12 months' imprisonment in fixing default terms. On the other hand, magistrates' courts are subject to schedule 4 of the Magistrates' Courts' Act 1980, which restricts default terms according to the amount outstanding at the time imprisonment is imposed, and the effect of the amendment is that the Crown court should be bound by the same terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people would believe that there is no discernible reason for the Crown court to be at large up to a maximum! of 12 months where magistrates' courts are restricted by the scale set out in the schedule to which I have referred. The arguments for applying the same scale to all criminal courts are persuasive and I am, therefore, happy to be able to accept the amendment. I ought to add that consequential amendments will be necessary to section 31 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1971 and other relevant legislation. We will bring these forward at a later stage, but for the present I recommend to my hon. Friends and to the Committee that this new clause be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss new clause 18—Application of Bail Act to immigration offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These new clauses concern those who have been recommended for deportation under the Immigration Act 1971. New clause 13 provides that time spent on remand in custody by the defendant who has been recommended for deportation should count towards a later custodial sentence, as occurs in the case of all other defendants remanded in custody. New clause 18, on the other hand, would empower courts to impose conditions as to residence and reporting to the police on people whom they release after recommending them for deportation. Both the new clauses embody recommendations made by the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group in our report, " Too Many Prisoners " and they have the support of the Magistrates' Association, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and of NACRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980, there were 1,137 receptions into penal establishments of prisoners held under the Immigration Act 1971. These prisoners fell into several different categories. Some were awaiting the making or carrying out of a deportation order, either after the court had recommended that they be deported or after the Home Secretary had decided to use his own powers to make a deportation order against the person who has either overstayed or committed an offence without the court recommending deportation. There are also those awaiting removal, not deportation, because they are alleged to have entered illegally into this country in the first place. And, again, there is a small number of people who have been refused entry and are also held in prison awaiting removal from this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average length of time which these Immigration Act prisoners spend in custody is a little over 50 days, but in some cases the periods for which they are detained are considerably longer. The latest breakdown that I have been able to obtain is for prisoners discharged in 1978. Of 1,340 prisoners discharged during that year, 203 had been in custody for over two months and up to three months; a further 161 had been in custody for over three months and up to six months; 26 had been in custody for six and up to nine months and, finally, three had been held in custody for over nine months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its report, "The Reduction of Pressure on the Prison System", published in 1978, the Select Committee on Expenditure pointed out that in most cases where a court recommends that a deportation order should be made on an offender, the sentence itself is a non-custodial one. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The result however is the detention of the person for weeks, maybe months, awaiting the Home Secretary's decision whether to make a deportation order. We think it right that courts should be asked to consider more carefully than they sometimes do whether or not it is necessary to make a recommendation for deportation. A court's failure to make such a recommendation does not prevent the Home Office from exercising its own power to make a deportation order if it so decides. The courts should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
reminded that in less than half cases where a court has recommended deportation in recent years has a deportation order actually been made."</p></blockquote>
That is from paragraph 101.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a court recommends someone for deportation, unless it specifically states that he should not be detained in custody he is automatically sent to prison for an indeterminate period while the Home Secretary makes up his mind on the question of deportation. In the case of defendants accused of ordinary criminal offences, Parliament has gone out of its way in the Bail Act, which has been referred to on previous clauses, to enact a statutory presumption in favour of bail; but, in the Immigration Act cases, Parliament has gone the other way by stipulating that the accused will be kept in custody pending the Home Secretary's decision about deportation, unless the court otherwise directs. The presumption therefore is entirely contrary to that entailed within the Bail Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Expenditure Committee said that it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"inclined to agree that the alleged immigrant should be released on bail if he or she satisfied the same criteria as apply to the granting of bail to persons accused of a criminal offence."</p></blockquote>
That is from paragraph 108.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office took a very welcome step towards ensuring that this would happen in practice in its circular 113/1978 entitled "Immigration Act 1971: Detention Pending Deportation", which suggested that, when deciding whether to order release pending a decision on deportation, courts might wish to bear in mind the principal grounds for withholding bail in criminal proceedings. In particular, it suggested that detention would not be appropriate unless there were good reasons to suppose that the person would abscond or commit further offences if released on bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when courts grant bail under the Bail Act to people charged with criminal offences, they can require sureties and impose restrictions or conditions, which makes the courts more inclined to grant bail to some defendants whom they would remand in custody if the only alternative was unconditional release on bail. The courts unfortunately do not have comparable powers to impose conditions on those released pending a decision on deportation, and the Magistrates' Association, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and NACRO have all suggested that to give the give the courts such powers would help to reduce the numbers unnecessarily detained under the Immigration Act. For this reason " Too May Prisoners " recommended that
	<br><blockquote><p>"legislation should be enacted to make the Bail Act's provisions applicable to persons liable to imprisonment under the Immigration Act powers".</p></blockquote>
That is from paragraph 126.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nearly 18 months ago, in November 1980, the Home Secretary told the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group that the Government had provisionally concluded that courts should be empowered to release a person recommended for deportation subject to restrictions as to residence and
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
reporting to the police. The Home Secretary added that the Government needed time to consider a number of detailed issues, such as the nature of the sanctions for non-compliance, but said that, subject to this, the Government proposed to implement this proposal when there was a convenient legislative opportunity. The opportunity is here before us now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary also said that the point about time on remand in custody being counted towards a later custodial sentence had also been noted for legislation, and that in the meantime the same effect would be achieved by recommending the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy in such cases unless the court had taken time on remand into account when it had passed sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was therefore, given those assurances from the Home Secretary, somewhat surprised to see that neither of those proposals was contained in the Bill when it was published, and these two new clauses are designed to rectify that omission. Ideally, I would have liked the Government to have gone further than new clause 18 and to have applied the full provisions of the Bail Act to all these cases, including the statutory presumption in favour of bail and the power to require sureties. However, I am realistic and I have deliberately framed the new clause in accordance with the Government's own previously expressed intentions, and I therefore hope that at least as a minimum the Minister will be able to indicate that he is prepared to accept them today or at least bring forward amendments to a similar effect at a later stage in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say at once that the Government accept the need to remove the anomaly in the interaction between the Immigration Act 1971 and the Criminal Justice Act 1967 by which periods spent simultaneously under detention under the 1971 Act in custody on remand do not count towards the sentence subsequently imposed. We have dealt with the anomaly up to now by the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy in those cases where we know that the court itself did not take it into account in passing sentence. But that is an unsatisfactory approach and we have undertaken to remove the anomaly by means of this Bill.

We cannot accept the new clause as it stands. In two respects it is too broad in its effect and in aonther not broad enough. As drafted, it would allow a period spent in detention under the Immigration Act alone to reduce any sentences of imprisonment subsequently imposed. That cannot be right. The decision whether or not to order detention under the Immigration Act is quite separate from the decision of the court whether to remand the defendant in custody or on bail. The power invested in an immigration officer to authorise detention is exercised solely in connection with the determination of the grant or refusal of leave to enter the country; and persons so detained may simply be confined to a ship or an aircraft—they do not necessarily go to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court, on the other hand, will be concerned solely with the criteria for the grant or refusal of bail in connection with criminal proceedings. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
should therefore deal only with the situation where the court orders remand in custody but the period spent on remand, or some part of it, is prevented from counting towards the sentence simply because a detention order is made at the same time as, or during, the remand. Furthermore, it would be wrong to allow detention order time to reduce the sentence when such an order is made, as sometimes happens, after the offender is already in custody under sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid it is rather complex but we need to ensure that the form of the new clause is precise in its effect as I have indicated. But we should also ensure that the amendment to section 67 of the 1967 Act is broad enough to apply to other forms of detention where similar anomalies might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore propose to bring forward our own provision on Report to deal with these aspects, and I hope that hon. Members who support this new clause will feel able on that assurance to withdraw it in the knowledge that we are wholly in sympathy with their principal objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to new clause 18. Under the Immigration Act, if a court convicts a person who does not have a right of abode in this country it may recommend that he be deported. The court may order that the person be released while his recommendation is being considered by the Home Secretary. Otherwise he will be detained. The court cannot, however, release the person subject to conditions. The amendment would give the courts this power and they would be able to impose conditions as to residence and reporting to the police. The Government support the objective of the new clause, which is to reduce the number of people detained in prison by allowing a court to release on conditions a person whom it would not otherwise think could be released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years there has been a downward trend in the number of persons given a non-custodial sentence who have been detained. On 11 February 1982—the latest convenient date—there were 12 people detained in prison who had been recommended for deportation by a court and were serving a non-custodial sentence. However, we do think it
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
right that a change should nonetheless be made, despite the resource implications, for the police to give the courts the same power to require reporting. It will be important for this power to be used only where it is thought essential, and indeed it is important that the power of imposing conditional release should be used where the courts would otherwise have detained that person, not where they would now release him unconditionally. If the new provision is used in this way, as I have indicated, the number of people who might benefit from it in any one year, based on last year's figures, would be less than 150. The extra work for the police would not, therefore, be too great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, some other points arise. The hon. Gentleman has quite reasonably based his new clause on a similar provision already in the Immigration Act. That, however, relates to the Secretary of State's powers, and we are not convinced that it is entirely apt where a court is imposing the condition. We should therefore like to consider further, for instance, whether the court needs to be given a power to vary the conditions of release. There might also be some need to reconsider the power of enforcement available to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have indicated sufficiently that our sympathy for the objectives of the two new clauses —I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing them forward—is such that we are prepared to take steps ourselves to get them into proper order. We should wish to bring our own amendment back on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
