<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs <span class='memberconstituency'> (Battersea, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 2, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7A) Where a person is convicted or found guilty of an offence and he has not been legally represented, the court may not—
<ol>
<li>make a detention centre order in respect of him; or</li>
<li>pass a youth custody sentence on him."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Although, strictly speaking, the wording of theamendment is intended merely to ensure that no custodial sentence will be imposed on a young person unless that young person has been legally represented in court. I hope that the effect of the amendment will be to ensure that all young people appearing in court will have such legal representation. I have never met a member of the legal profession with whom I have discussed this problem who is not positive that legal representation should be available for all people— not just for young people—but, of course, I am concerned only with people under the age of 21.<br><br>
The first experience of appearing in a court by a young person can be frightening and intimidating. Often young people are on their own, as it were, without any help or advice as to how they should conduct themselves or how they should plead. This may well have been preceded by experiences with the police which, on the basis of conversations I have had with people who have been in trouble, make one rather concerned about what the police do and say to young people who have been arrested and are due to appear in court.<br><br>
Let me quote one or two instances that give full support to the belief that young people are desperately in need of legal representation when they get themselves into trouble of this sort. I have known instances where the police have come upon four young people doing something and have said " We'll have two of you " regardless of which of the four were actually doing any particular thing. Alternatively, the police have said, either in the street or in the police station, "You haven't got a previous record; you will get off lightly; you might as well plead guilty ". They have even said " Your mates have got a record; they will get into big trouble; you had better plead guilty to save them getting into more trouble ". A lot of evidence suggests that frequently when young people get into trouble with the police they are coerced into pleading guilty when they come into court. As they have no legal repre-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
sentation, and are not given the sort of advice that they ought to have, they inevitably get into trouble. They are convicted. They serve a sentence; it may not be a custodial sentence—it may be a fine—but they serve a sentence. They are then on a slippery slope to getting into further trouble thereafter.<br><br>
This is all compounded by the fact that if the police know that the young people are going to plead guilty, the evidence frankly is sometimes rather sloppy. Any member of the Committee who has been in some of these courts will have seen that the evidence as given by the police would not stand the test of scrutiny by a solicitor if he were representing the young person concerned. Added to it, sadly, there is sometimes the sense of bravado that young people may feel about being arrested and appearing in a court. They may indeed boast of the offence that they have committed and give the worst possible impression of what they have done, rather than present themselves in a more favourable light.<br><br>
The case is, therefore, fairly clear, but it is necessary to turn a little bit to what actually happens in terms of how many people have legal representation. As far as I have been able to ascertain, there are no adequate statistics on how many people do have legal representation, especially young people. One is advised to look at the figures that are given for legal aid. Of course, it does not mean that because a person has been refused legal aid he many not be legally represented. Such people can pay for legal representation themselves or their parents may. However, in practice, there is a close relationship between whether legal aid is granted and whether an individual has legal representation although, as I shall point out in a moment, it depends to some extent on the type of court at which the hearing is conducted.<br><br>
Legal aid is granted usually depending upon the financial circumstances of the applicant. If the applicant is poor enough—and this would apply in the case of many of the young people we are talking about—then on those grounds legal aid should be granted. There are also, however, other grounds, for example, whether the offence is serious enough to merit legal representation and there are instances where legal aid has been refused because the offence is regarded by the court as fairly trivial. Even if it is a trivial offence in the eyes of the court, or the magistrate, in deciding whether to give legal aid, for a young person it may well be the first step on the path to becoming a habitual offender. I think the first experience of appearing in court, of being prosecuted and of being punished sets many people on the path to doing the same sort of thing again. One finds that legal aid may be refused on such grounds.<br><br>
Another criterion for granting legal aid is to ensure that justice is done, and the court has to decide that it is desirable to do so in the interests of justice. It goes on to talk about the means of the individual.<br><br>
What happens in practice as regards legal aid? Some statistics have been published. It is clear that the majority of people appearing for trial in front of a Crown court will have legal aid and, therefore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
legal representation. The figures for 1980 suggest that in trials in the Crown courts, 97 per cent, of the people applied for legal aid and legal aid was granted to 99 per cent. This means that the percentage of people who were granted legal aid was 96 per cent. That covers virtually all before the Crown court on trial. Where hearings deal with appeals against sentence following a magistrates' court conviction or appeals against a magistrates' court conviction, particularly in the latter case, the level of legal representation may be lower.<br><br>
We turn to magistrates' courts proceedings where we have both adult and juvenile courts. Young people under the age of 17 will be appearing before juvenile courts. The figures for 1980 for England and Wales were as follows: 30 per cent, of those who were due to appear at a juvenile court applied for legal aid; 91 per cent, of such applications were granted, which in effect means that only 27 per cent, of defendants were legally represented except for those who may have paid for it themselves. Even if one makes an allowance for those who paid for it themselves, the large proportion of people appearing before juvenile courts would not have been legally represented.<br><br>
One may argue that probation officers or social workers would have been present and there would have been social inquiry reports and therefore to an extent, some statements might have appeared in favour of the defendant. Nevertheless, no clear advice would have been given to the defendant as to how to conduct himself or herself. There would have been nobody there speaking clearly on behalf of the accused.<br><br>
Perhaps the greater problem concerns young people between the ages of 17 and 21. If they appear before magisrates courts charged with an indictable offence, the figures for 1980 suggest that 70 per cent, applied for legal aid and 89 per cent, of the applications were granted, resulting in 62 per cent, of people having legal aid.<br><br>
It is much more significant, however, in the case of summary offences. Although summary offences are sometimes regarded as being less serious than indictable offences, quite a number of summary offences carry imprisonment as a possible punishment or penalty. In 1980, only 3 per cent, of those charged with summary offences actually applied for legal aid. Sixty-three per cent, of those were granted with the result that only 2 per cent, of defendants were legally represented, unless they had private means to have legal representation.<br><br>
It may seem that a large number of people are able to afford this commodity but, frankly, I doubt that they would have made a significant difference to the figures. The fact is that for those people charged with summary offences, the vast majority would not have had legal representation. As far as 1 can establish, statistics are not available to show separations between people over 21 and people under 21, but I can only assume that these statistics hold good for those people under the age of 21.<br><br>
From the overall figures, therefore, it is seen that the vast majority of young people charged with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
summary offences in magistrates' courts will not have had legal representation. There also appears to be a random pattern of refusal rates of legal aid, as published recently in the LAG Bulletin which produced some figures for courts in the London area. It showed that the average refusal rate in proceedings in Inner London magistrates' courts in 1977 to 1980 was 3 per cent, before the Inner London juvenile court and 4 per cent, in Hampstead. At Highbury Corner the figure for refusal was 26 per cent., with an average for the Metropolitan area of 16 per cent. The figures for legal aid refusal rates in magistrates' courts in Outer London 1980 vary from 6 per cent, in Watford, which was the best, and 36 per cent, in Uxbridge, which was the worst.<br><br>
Not only do we have a low proportion of people charged with summary offences who have legal representation as a result of refusal of legal aid, but the legal aid refusal rates themselves are more eratic than the merit of the individual applications would suggest. There is a large element of the lottery in this. It is quite wrong that this should be the case, and it is particularly wrong with regard to young people.<br><br>
If we wish to see justice done to young people, if we wish to see that some of their bad experiences with the police can, at least, be redressed by legal representation in the courts; and if we wish to stop young people being found guilty because they have been coerced into it by the police or because they do not know how to put the best case forward for themselves in court, it is essential for legal aid to be granted. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris <span class='memberconstituency'> (Derbyshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. How he would deal with those offenders who wilfully refuse legal aid in order to escape being sent for a custodial sentence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that I understood the hon. Gentleman's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk <span class='memberconstituency'> (Ormskirk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think what the hon. Gentleman is getting at is that the amendment, containing a principle with which we all agree, is perhaps potentially defective in /that it says that an offender shall not be given a custodial sentence unless he is " legally represented ", whereas what my hon. Friend presumably seeks to ensure is that he has been offered legal representation.<br><br>
Clearly, under my hon. Friend's amendment, if an offender refused legal aid then, technically, he could not be given a custodial sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. If that is an interpretation of my amendment, I accept that, in that sense, its drafting is defective, but I have two new clauses that cover the same point which I hope are not defective.<br><br>
The important thing is the principle that I am trying to establish, and I hope that the Minister will comment sympathetically to the case put forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
Committee if I responded at once to what the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) has said. I begin by thanking him for the reasonable and helpful way he has moved the amendment. I can respond to it with sympathy although, not least for the reason to which he has just referred, it is not possible for me to accept it. However, we wish to consider it with sympathy.<br><br>
The amendment would ensure that no young offender would be given a detention centre order or a youth custody sentence without having had legal representation after his conviction but before the sentence was imposed on him. No one would expect me to contest the proposition that courts as well as defendants benefit from legal representation having been available in the course of the proceedings. The amendment deals only with the sentencing of young offenders where a custodial sentence is being contemplated. In 1980, about 2,500 young offenders were given custodial sentences of a type which they had previously already received—that is, bostal training or a detention centre.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Under the existing law that is important because the courts' power to pass sentence on them was not restricted by any consideration about whether they were legally represented. The existing law is to be found in section 21 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 and the general rule is that neither a magistrates' court on summary conviction nor a Crown court on a committal sentence or on indictment shall imprison, send to borstal, or send to a detention centre a young offender who is not legally represented. That is the general law, because this qualification bears exactly upon the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris).<br><br>
The qualification is that the requirement shall not apply if the defendant applied for legal aid and was refused it because his means were sufficient, or that he had failed to apply for legal aid having been informed of his right and given an opportunity to do so. That is the qualification to the general rule. What the court has to look to is whether a young offender has already served a custodial sentence of the type which it contemplates giving him.<br><br>
It is consistent with our belief that custody should be a last resort, especially in the case of a young offender, that a court minded to pass such a sentence should have the benefit of counsel or solicitor on behalf of the defendant before it determines what sentence to pass after conviction. The hon. Gentleman's amendment, therefore, poses the question whether it is sufficient to go on as we are—in other words, whether the requirement should be that legal representation should be present only where the defendant has not previously had the punishment of the type that the court is contemplating, or whether we ought to go further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. and learned Gentleman has said so far is most appreciated by Opposition Members, but he is careful to ensure that what he says relates only to those offenders
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
who have been convicted but not yet sentenced. Is he saying that the Government accept only that young offenders should be represented only after conviction and before sentence, whereas the point of my hon. Friend's amendment is to ensure that they are legally represented before they are convicted? My hon. Friend's point was that a larger number of them are more likely not to be convicted, or to be given non-custodial sentences, were they to be legally represented right from the beginning and throughout the court proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is for once not quite accurate when he says that the effect of the amendment is to require legal representation before conviction. The effect of the amendment is to require representation only after conviction and before sentence. It comes in paragraph (7A), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>" Where a person is convicted or found guilty of an offence and he has not been legally represented, the court may not <i>(a)</i> make a detention centre order in respect of him: or <i>(b)</i> pass a youth custody sentence on him."</p></blockquote>
I am addressing myself to the terms of the amendment, though I would not seek to deny the advantages of legal representation on conviction. I am dealing with the amendment and I think it is right that I should do so.<br><br>
While it is certainly true that of the 2,500 offenders dealt with in 1980—who had previously served a custodial sentence of the type which they then received for the second time—the great majority would have been granted legal aid and been represented, the Government appreciate that there may well be a strong case for extending the statutory requirement to each occasion on which a custodial sentence is contemplated. We should, however, need to make some estimation of the numbers likely to be affected because of the resource considerations involved. We understand the concern that lies behind this amendment, which has been well stressed. Though I cannot give a commitment, I undertake to consider sympathetically whether any provision can be made in the Bill to give effect to this amendment. The amendment is as I have indicated, technically deficient, for other reasons, for instance, it does not apply to a sentence of life custody.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman would be content with that expression of the Government's approach to his amendment and felt able to withdraw it, that might appear to be the most satisfactory way of proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down may I just make clear that although I accept that the drafting may be defective, the intention was certainly to achieve legal representation throughout the court proceedings and not simply after conviction but before sentence. Does the Minister accept that that is the main argument I put forward, and is that the one to which he is sympathetic?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I cannot go so far because far greater resources may be needed if every trial has to take place with legal representation. It is not possible at present to estimate in one case or another, the extent of that, but I am able to give
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
a sympathetic response to the effect of the amendment, because it is confined to those cases where conviction has taken place and the court is contemplating a custodial sentence. Very much heavier demands on resources would be expected to be made if legal representation had to be present at every trial, so I must address myself to the words and the effect of the amendment. What I said applies only to the amendment as drafted for the reasons I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'> (Accrington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been sympathetic and helpful up to a point. I am not being churlish when I say that. It was a sympathetic reply. But the hon. and learned Gentleman will appreciate, I am sure, that when my hon. Friend was arguing for—whether the amendment covers the point or not is questionable—is that all young defendants appearing in court ought to be represented, not only when it comes to sentence but at the conduct of the case itself. That is the moct important part. The most important thing for a youngster facing trial is whether he is convicted or not in the first place. It is that conviction, even more than the sentence itself, which will damage him for the rest of his career.<br><br>
All research shows, as the hon. and learned Gentleman will be the first to admit, that the chances of being acquitted if one is represented are far greater than if one is not represented—that is indisputable and I do not think that anyone would argue to the contrary—just as one is more likely to get bail if one is represented than if one is not; just as the sentence is more likely to be less severe if one is represented than if one is not; and just as one is less likely to make a false plea of guilty for convenience, to get the case over with or because one does not appreciate the full consequences of what a guilty plea will mean if one is not represented. Therefore, the case for ensuring that all young people are represented throughout their trial in the magistrates' court is very great.<br><br>
A lot of the argument so far has centred round legal aid and the Minister's reluctance to concede that a youngster should be represented at the hearing of the case is based upon resources, such as the cost of legal aid. What about the duty solicitor's scheme? How effective is that? At present it seems to me, and to most practitioners, that the duty solicitor's scheme, welcome as it is, is not much more—and cannot be expected to be much more at present—than a first aid scheme. It would be unreasonable to expect many of the duty solicitors— some of whom are young solicitors, not particularly experienced, who do not have sufficient time to prepare the case—suddenly to go into court and make a plea of mitigation, let alone conduct the case on the facts. Are any discussions going on, or has the Lord Chancellor any plans to expand the duty solicitor's scheme.<br><br>
I take it one step further. Have there been any discussions to consider setting up a public defender's office along the lines of the American scheme? That has been in operation for a long time and though
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
there are many imperfections in the American criminal legal system, the public defender's scheme is one of the few plusses. Can the Minister say whether any discussions are going on in the Lord Chancellor's Department perhaps to bring into being a public defender's scheme, which might turn out to be far cheaper than the ad hoc granting of legal aid?<br><br>
I do not have the figures. I put it as pure speculation at the moment, but I should be most interested to know whether the Minister can give the Committee any information about that. Meanwhile, I welcome his assurance that he will look at my hon. Friend's amendment.<br><br>
The crux of the matter really, and the most serious point as far as a youngster is concerned, is that he should be represented throughout the hearing of his case. It is the conviction itself that will be the most damaging thing to him if it is possible, as a result of being represented, for a not guilty verdict to come in as opposed to a guilty verdict. I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at the wider point and to give some sort of hope that he can bring in a scheme whereby no youngster charged with a criminal offence, a summary offence, can appear in court and can eventually be convicted without having legal aid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin <span class='memberconstituency'> (Dulwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has dealt with the amendment on a rather narrow basis. I do not blame him for that because I accept that the drafting, which is technically defective, may well have led him to think that that was the narrower definition or narrower construction than what my hon. Friend had in mind.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
However, we are now dealing with a most important subject, and I am sure that the Minister would not want to confine the discussion to the very narrow limits which might be found within the technical words of the defective amendment. The Minister particularly would not want to do so as he has agreed to consider sympathetically the principle behind my hon. Friend's amendment and if he does that, it is obviously important that he should look at the principle in its full width to which the Committee may wish to address itself.<br><br>
Turning the amendment round, as it were, in my view, it is wrong that a young person should be given a custodial sentence unless he has had full opportunity legally aided and legally represented from the beginning of the proceedings. I recognise that there are difficulties about that. The difficulty that immediately strikes one is that—if put in that way without reservation and without the advantage of being considered by the Minister and his advisers —however trivial an offence in practice might be within the category which could render a young person liable to a custodial sentence, the court should be obligated to grant legal aid. I accept that that would be an impossible waste of resources.<br><br>
I accept that there is a considerable difficulty with regard to courts because, generally speaking, until they have heard what the case is about, they do not know whether it will be in that trivial category or in a more serious category.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
The point of decision is not an easy one and the way in which the decision is to be made is not easy. Nonetheless, having said that, I commend the principle that I have suggested as being important. I put it in this way and speak not only from experience of the courts but from the experience of my constituents. I am sure that other hon. Members will have had the same experience when dealing with constituent cases of young people who have got in to some kind of trouble with the law. In the event, I have found a number of cases of being acquitted, but certainly they are much more likely to be acquitted if they have the advantage of legal aid from the start.<br><br>
My hon. Friend made his opening remarks eloquently and I found myself in almost total agreement with him. He concentrated on representation in court. All of us with experience of the courts know that it is not simply representation in court that matters. Very often, probably in the majority of cases, the preparation of the case—whether it be before conviction, the obtaining perhaps of witnesses, the obtaining, even prior to conviction, of evidence of good character—may sway the court in a doubtful case as to whether a young person ought to be convicted or not. All kinds of matters of that sort require the services of a solicitor, and sometimes the advice of counsel in a difficult case. A young person himself cannot possibly be expected to engineer it if he is left without legal representation. That is the first aspect of the matter. Secondly, there is the aspect that arises after conviction because again it is not sufficient simply to have somebody standing by in court who can say a few words. In many cases, as the Minister knows, the important aspect of what is said by the representative of the person who is convicted, whether a young person or an adult, arises not from a few casual words with him or his parents in the court proceedings or after his conviction, but as a result of looking into the background and preparing the case properly so that there is put before the courts everything that is relevant to the way in which he should be treated.<br><br>
My only criticism of what my hon. Friend said, although I am certain he had close regard for those matters, is that he did not emphasise them as much as he emphasised the consideration of someone able to speak for the young person in court who may be unable properly to speak for himself, particularly if he is inexperienced. In my view the adequate preparation of any case is the essence of whether one gets the right result in the end or not. The task of the advocate is important, but it is nothing like as important as the proper preparation. I should like to ensure that young people have the benefit of that before there is any question of a custodial sentence being passed upon them. The benefit of that, not merely when it comes to the question of sentence, but when it comes to the preparation of the case, will decide whether or not the young person is convicted. I have seen many cases where on the face of the evidence at first blush, as it were, there seems to be a strong case against a young person such as identification and so on. He may perhaps say " I was not there. It was not me. It may have been somebody else who did it." In the end, when
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
a thorough examination has been made by a legal representative, it may be found that what he said was right, or at least that there was sufficient doubt about it to justify an acquittal.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister, when he looks sympathetically at the principle behind my hon. Friend's amendment, will look at it in that wider context and try to find some form of wording that will deal with the difficulty that I have admitted and understand exists, but which nonetheless gives effect to what I have been saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my understanding that the existing provision in law for mandatory representation applies only after conviction and before sentence. In that sense, perhaps it is not unusual that the Minister should have responded narrowly to my hon. Friend's speech and his amendment. I do not blame the Minister for taking that view. On reflection, I think that the amendment is slightly unclear. However, it was my interpretation that my hon. Friend was seeking to ensure that no custodial sentence should be passed in future on a young offender unless that young offender had had the opportunity to be legally represented. If that was not clear in the amendment, it was certainly clear in my hon. Friend's speech, and it was on that basis that I intervened in the Minister's speech.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has now made it clear, as has my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dul-wich (Mr. Silkin), that the principle of legal representation for young offenders at all stages of a criminal proceeding is the intention behind the amendment. It is that intention that I support.<br><br>
It is not necessary at this stage again to go through the grave consequences for a young offender who is sentenced to a custodial sentence. We all know of the deleterious consequences that inevitably follow a custodial sentence and in view of those consequences it is extremely important that the young offender's case should be presented properly and coherently in court. It is clearly not possible for the young offender to present the case in anything like the sophisticated and appropriate manner of a legal representative. In the main, young offenders are far from articulate. If they are articulate, usually they are not educationally well equipped to prepare, let alone present, their own case.<br><br>
To drive that point home, I shall quote some recent figures on the educational background and attainments of young people that were provided in a NACRO briefing of January 1982. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>" Thirty per cent, of borstal and detention centre trainees are almost illiterate, having a reading age of under 10. On 13 January 1982, 37 of the trainees at Rochester, 209 at Glen Parva, 51 at Everthorpe, 31 at Aylesbury and 61 at Feltham borstal had reading ages of less than 10. On the same date, 51 trainees at Feltham, 27 at Rochester 76 at Glen Parva, 48 at Everthorpe and 30 at Aylesbury were currently attending remedial education classes."</p></blockquote>
Those figures were provided in a recent parliamentary answer to myself and were contained in a NACRO briefing.<br><br>
It is clear that the young people with whom we are concerned, who we acknowledge to be inarticulate, inadequate and socially deprived, are educationally incapable of presenting themselves. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
is the conclusion to be drawn from the Minister's figures. Yet the Minister, by refusing to accept the intention behind the amendment, is saying that they shall not have the right guaranteed by the State to be legally represented in proceedings that may lead to a loss of liberty.<br><br>
Legal representation is important because it can ensure that proceedings are properly clarified for the young person; that full inquiries are made to ensure that the prosecution has properly and accurately presented the facts of the case; that the young person is made aware and able to make a considered judgment on the plea that he wants to put before the court; that the young offender's views are heard and expressed in a way that they would not otherwise be; that there is a clear presentation of any mitigating circumstances and that the reports of social workers and the like may be properly scrutinised and challenged for inaccuracies; and that if sentenced to custody he can get proper advice on bail and on appeal. All those are extremely important to any individual; they are absolutely crucial to a young offender who is inarticulate, disadvantaged, uneducated, deprived and facing the prospect of the loss of his liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that there is something dramatically wrong with the education system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously there is. I should not have thought there was much room for argument or doubt about that. Of course there is, but I am not going to go down that path now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons <span class='memberconstituency'> (Bradford, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree also that those figures which he so valuably quoted show that many of these youngsters come from broken homes and have been dragged up rather than having been given a decent opportunity in life?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures demonstrate what we all know, that the juveniles and young offenders who find themselves in penal institutions or other custodial establishments are, in the main, those who come from poor, inadequate homes and social backgrounds. That is a further important consideration which must be taken into account when considering the intention behind the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do the figures not reveal also that many of those who are in detention centres might not have been sent to them if they had not pleaded guilty, and that they did not understand the full consequences of pleading guilty? If they had been represented they may well not have pleaded guilty.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with my hon. and learned Friend. We all have knowledge and experience of such sentences being passed in those circumstances. It is to reduce the likelihood of such individuals receiving a custodial sentence, or making a plea of guilty when they do not wish to and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
when they are not guilty of the offence of which they are being charged, that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) has moved the amendment.<br><br>
Section 21 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts Act 1973 makes it mandatory for an offender of any age to be offered legal representation before the imposition of a first custodial sentence. The considerations which I have briefly outlined have a special force for those who have the possibility of a custodial sentence being passed upon them for the first time. Nevertheless, they remain valid, important and powerful arguments for any offender at any stage. Although the precise wording of my hon. Friend's amendment is defective—it does not make crystal clear that he intends that there shall be an offer of legal representation to young offenders before court proceedings as well as after conviction and before sentence, and implies that a young offender in refusing the offer of legal representation could thereby avoid the imposition of a custodial sentence—the Opposition wish it to be clearly established that no young offender will be given a custodial sentence in future unless and until he has been offered legal representation throughout the proceedings. We consider that to be important in helping to reduce the number of those who are incarcerated in penal institutions and in benefiting individual young offenders.<br><br>
The Minister's response to my hon. Friend's amendment, sympathetic and helpful though it may have been on a very narrow and restricted point, does nothing to meet the general principle that has been enunciated. For that reason I hope that my hon. Friend will insist on pushing the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In case there is any further doubt about the intention behind the amendment, may I make clear that I was seeking to ensure that any young person who appears in court, charged with an offence which carries with it the risk of a custodial sentence, will be legally represented in court and will have the benefit of legal advice before the court hearing? The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I am disappointed by his response. It seems that he used the argument of excessive cost in providing legal representation for young people as a way of resisting the suggestion that is implicit in the amendment.<br><br>
Without going into the details, which would not be appropriate on this amendment, of the way in which the legal aid system works and the cost of that system, I wonder whether the Minister is being a little shortsighted. There is an enormous cost to society in having young people in custody. There is an enormous cost, financial and otherwise, in having a system which does not ensure that young people feel that they receive justice in our courts. Most young people who have appeared before the courts and have not had the benefit of legal advice come away feeling that the system was set up against them and that they did not have a fair chance. They feel that the police were against them and the court was against them and that they did not have a fair chance to make their case.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
I have tabled new clauses which I suspect will also be technically defective, so I shall take the opportunity to reconsider the wording of them. I do not wish, for the reasons stated, to push the amendment to a vote. I regret that I cannot do so, but I accept that the amendment is technically defective for the reason the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) stated earlier. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that it is the duty of the Chair to consider, first, whether the principle of the clause has been adequately discussed. If it is the Chair's view that that is so, the Question must be put forthwith. I do not propose to do that, but I tell the Committee that it would not be appropriate to cover in detail the issues which have already been covered fully in the amendments that have been discussed. Dr. Shirley Williams—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill <span class='memberconstituency'> (Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Dean, I have often been called Shirley Williams by mistake. I have also been called Shirley Temple by mistake. Given the choice, I think I prefer the latter.<br><br>
In clause 1 we are saying to the courts that they should not put someone under 21 into custody unless they are of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him that is appropriate.<br><br>
The clause comes before us at an apt time. As the Minister knows, the prison population, which includes under 21s, has risen sharply since the end of December from 40,800 to 42,800. That is the total prison population and incorporates the under-21s. That is a startling increase in the total prison population to take place within possibly less than two months. The total increase is more than 2,000. What is the proportion of under-21s?<br><br>
Why does the Minister think that there has been such a sudden increase over such a short period, bearing in mind that for a whole year the courts were at the receiving end of pleas by the Home Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice, Parliament and many other bodies to try to ensure that wherever possible non-custodial sentences were imposed? Were the number of convictions for crimes of violence so much higher during that period? We would appreciate some possible explanation for this worrying increase.<br><br>
Secondly, the Minister often refers during these discussions to his new prison programme and the fact that new prisons will be started—if not completed—at the rate of two a year for the next four years. Will the Minister attempt to answer my parliamentary question, which he was unable to do in his recent reply? I asked him in the question whether the building programme would provide new prison places which would help to deal with the increased population, or whether it would merely replace existing places.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
In a recent speech the Home Secretary described the appalling conditions for existing prisoners. Although the Opposition believe that the emphasis should be placed on replacing existing accommodation, trying to get rid of three in a cell and Victorian buildings, will the Minister explain in more detail the extent of the so-called new prison places and the extent to which they will be replacements? When we talk about new prison places, the average person thinks that there will be accommodation for the additional prisoners who are filling the prison system, whereas we hope that they will be used to make life in prisons more civilised for those who are there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to remind the Minister of the undertaking which he gave during our first sitting when I raised, in moving a series of amendments, the condition of the mentally ill and the physically disabled on whom the court wishes to pass a detention centre order but who are found unfit for a detention centre order and are subsequently sentenced to youth custody, and who, following that, serve their sentences in adult prisons. The Minister accepted that this was a serious and important point. It seems to me and to many of my hon. Friends to be quite wrong that those who are mentally and physically disabled should be put into the most appalling conditions in adult prisons. I sought an assurance from the Minister that he would consider this issue again. He gave that assurance and intimated to me that he would return to it when the Committee debated whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman has considered again what provision will be made for the physically and mentally disabled and I hope that we shall hear his proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon <span class='memberconstituency'> (York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is about the only opportunity that we shall have to discuss the central principle of the Bill, which is to move from indeterminate to determinate sentencing. As this is such a fundamental principle of the Bill, I recognise that it may be argued that it was sanctioned on Second Reading, but I doubt very much whether the high expectations of the penal reformers and penal reactionaries will be realised by what is about to happen.<br><br>
I still believe that the concept that was formed in the Home Office in the late 1960s, that a form of indeterminate sentencing was the best way of dealing with the problem of juvenile delinquency—has still much to commend it. It has failed in the interim becouse all Governments have failed to will the resources to make it a practical proposition. However, the sum total of the research that has been done on penal reform suggests that there is no way in which an adult offender, at any rate, will be reformed by anything we do to him in the prison system.<br><br>
In relation to the formative years, however, things can be done to assist a child to come to terms with the world in which he lives and to be able to deal with it more effectively, if we were prepared to will the resources.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
To treat children as if they are criminals, and to give them a finite sentence because that is the area of punishment, may now accord not only with those who want to punish them because punishment is good for them but with the penal reformers who say that indeterminate sentences are unjust on civil libertarian grounds. In terms of the net result, the likelihood is that we shall have net a better but a worse situation as a result of going over to finite sentencing. For reasons that I shall develop later in my amendment to clause 4, I believe that we will actually go in for a much higher prison population with much longer sentencing.<br><br>
I do not think that the determinate short sentencing will lead to a reduction in crime. It will be justified by experience. I hope that I am proved wrong because, ultimately, we all want to find a way of reducing the present incidence of crime. I suspect, however, that in another 10 or 15 years time we shall recognise that the Children and Young Persons Act was a pretty good piece of legislation.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept at once that we all wish to see lower populations in prison or in any other form of custody. What exercises us all, and certainly the Government, is how to achieve that lower population in custody at the same time maintaining proper protection to the public not least against violent offenders.<br><br>
If we were to be seen generally by the public to be placing the interests of those who offend in that way—by committing violent offences—ahead of the interests of the public, our system of criminal justice would prove something to the public and there would be disastrous results from that.<br><br>
Therefore, though it is a truism—and perhaps rather a trite remark to make on these occasions— it nonetheless bears repetition that the function of government when wrestling with these intractable problems, is to try to achieve a safe balance between those often conflicting considerations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) asked about the prison population. It is perfectly true that there has been a substantial rise in the prison population figures since just before Christmas, and it has now to be remembered that there was a reduction of about 5,000 in the latter half of last year. We reached more than 45,000 in July and there was a reduction of about 5,000 by Christmas. That was a welcome exception. There is always a seasonal reduction at the end of the year. The figures have now risen again to 42,800.<br><br>
While it is rash to speculate about these matters, there is no doubt that the guidance given by the Lord Chief Justice and by the Court of Appeal, in the cases of Upton and Bilsi in the middle of 1980 and reinforced subsequently on other occasions, has brought about a reduction in average prison sentences, both in the magistrates' courts and in the Crown court.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
During our sitting on 9 February, the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr Kilroy-Silk) stated:
<br><blockquote><p>" The Lord Chief Justice has already tried to ensure some control over the length of prison sentences imposed by the court He has given a very strong lead, particularly in the cases of Upton and Bilsi. This has already led to a slight reduction in the lengths of prison sentences." — <i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 9</i> February 1982; c. 49].</p></blockquote>
With that I entirely agree, and it is very welcome that for the first time that acknowledgement should have been made from the Opposition Benches. For my part I do not recall it having been said. It was often claimed by my right hon. Friend and myself, and that claim was frequently met with scepticism, to say the least. It is, therefore, important that it has been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister just cannot have that. The Opposition—not only myself but also a number of my hon. Friends—have constantly acknowledged that there has been some reduction. We have said that the reduction is far too small to manage the difficulty of the overcrowding of prisons. A drop of two months in the average Crown court sentence is going to make no impact at all on the problem we face of reducing the prison population by 10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman tells me that he has acknowledged that the reduction in prison sentence lengths is attributable to the courts and to the Lord Chief Justice's guidance, of course I accept it. However, he will agree that when that claim was made and that attribution put forward by my right hon. Friend and others, it has generally been greeted with considerable scepticism by Front Bench and other Opposition Members. However, the average length of prison sentences has started to come down, and that is important and welcome. We shall have to see how we go on. The actual figures which are quoted are unlocking figures. They are not connected by age category, and so I cannot tell the hon. Lady what proportion of the increase is represented by those who are under 21.<br><br>
She asked about new places in the new prison programme. I told her on a recent occasion that it is unlikely that any of the places that will be created by the prison building programme announced by my right hon. Friend in November last year will lead to a net increase in accommodation by reason of the dilapidation of the existing prison stock. However, I remind the Committee, since this has been particularly raised, that we are now facing the consequences of the cuts in the prison building programme that were made year after year by the previous Labour Government—cuts that I itemised in our prisons debate at the end of last year and which were recorded year after year in the annual report of the Prison Department. We now have to do the best we can and we are doing that in a prison building programme which my right hon. Friend was able to describe as the most comprehensive and largest of the century.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ormskirk rightly reminded me that I said that I would return to the questions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
of those sentenced to detention centres who are physically or mentally unfit for them. We dealt with this in paragraph 17 of the White Paper. That paragraph concerned discussion of several groups of short-term offenders or short-term sentences, including also those excluded from detention centres on the basis of their previous custodial history and those detained for default or contempt of court. The unfit in fact will not inevitably go to adult prisons.<br><br>
Since the White Paper was written we have given considerable thought to the allocation of young offenders and we have taken note of concern expressed about those who would be excluded from detention centres on grounds of unfitness. As with any offenders who have physical or mental problems, what is done will depend on the seriousness and nature of their condition. Obviously, the fact that they have mental or physical problems will weigh with the court in deciding whether or not a custodial sentence is appropriate. It bears repetition that only when a non-custodial sentence is not appropriate is the court already enabled by statute to send a young offender to custody.<br><br>
If the person requires hospital treatment, he will go to an establishment with appropriate medical facilities. If he has a condition that is stable but does not require current treatment, he is more likely to be placed in an ordinary establishment where the medical officer can exclude him from particular activities, but where he is still able to benefit from the regime as a whole. There is, therefore, no reason why a person should fail to receive proper medical attention because he has been excluded from a detention centre on grounds of unfitness.<br><br>
As to whether such a person is placed in the youth custody system or elsewhere, it has to be recognised, as clause 10 does, that unless there is a significant drop in the number of young offenders in custody it will not be possible to guarantee that everyone sentenced to youth custody can be placed in a youth custody centre. Priorities will have to be set.<br><br>
So far as the unfit are concerned, we think that every effort should be made to place juveniles— the under 17s—in youth custody centres. The over 17s—the young adults—will also be placed there in some cases, but in others may have to be held in prison accommodation. However, if these offenders require hospital treatment they will be held in a prison hospital and not in ordinary accommodation. If held in ordinary accommodation, they will be held with other young offenders, not with adults— that is to say, in separate wings.<br><br>
To summarise, 13 and 15 year olds are likely to be placed in youth custody centres on grounds of their age alone. Those aged 17-20 who are unfit for detention centres will go to ordinary or specialised youth custody centres, or ordinary or specialised prison accommodation, depending on the nature of their condition and the general level of demand for youth custody accommodation. We have had full debates on this clause, and therefore, I need say little more than to remind the Committee that there was a time—the time of the Children and Young Persons Act—when many people thought that it was possible
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
to manage the problem of juvenile crime without having a power to send 14 to 17 year old offenders into custody in exceptional cases.<br><br>
That was a time when idealism was matched by optimism. Today I think it is fair to say that almost nobody supposes that what might be called the welfare approach—typified by the Children and Young Persons Act, treatment in the community or in the residential home—is for a small minority of young offenders under 17 a practical proposition. There has to be, I think it is now generally agreed, some form of custodial sentence or order. That is the real reason why these provisions of the Children and Young Persons Act have never been implemented. It is founded on the experience of the horrific criminal activities of this small and very young minority, and on the fact that some of them are persistent offenders.<br><br>
In 1980, 19 per cent, of all those found guilty or cautioned for the offence of robbery—which after all is a serious offence—were aged between 14 and 17. In 1980, the rate of offending for boys between 14 and 17 was more than seven findings of guilt or cautions per 100 in that age group.<br><br>
There is a further reason. Modern penological thinking holds that it is important that tough young offenders in this small category should be made to face up to their responsibilities. I think that this clause, if one were to adopt a biological turn of phrase, imprints the genetic character of this part of the Bill dealing with young offenders. If one reffects that the genetic character of the Bill is imprinted by clause 1, one realises that it has to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. and learned Gentleman again, but I am rather interested in some of the things he is saying. He talks about what he acknowledges to be the small minority, and modern penological thinking now acknowledges that they ought to be made to face up to their responsibilities. I wonder which modern penological thinking is cited? Is it the Northern Ireland Office which now says that juveniles should not be held in penal establishments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who makes a close study of these matters, knows well that it is widely accepted that, whereas one keeps young offenders out of custody wherever possible, because no one can suppose that it very often reforms, it is also widely accepted that the tough and dangerous minority of young offenders must, by loss of dignity, be made to accept the consequences of what they have done. This is also the view of the public who suffer these violent offences.<br><br>
Therefore the clause, which sets the structure for the rest of this part of the Bill and establishes many propositions in the statute book for which the Opposition as well as Conservative Members have long campaigned, is a key part of the Bill. We shall return to the subject of detention centres in later debates, but the remainder of the clause is really the subject of substantial agreement even though there is disagreement round the edges. It is of key

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This series of amendments seeks to end the use of prison department custody for juveniles. At present the law says that the minimum age at which a detention centre sentence can be passed is 14 years and borstal training 15 years. The Bill makes no changes in the minimum age for detention centres and leaves the age of 15 available for youth custody.<br><br>
Amendment No. 12 raises the age on which a detention centre sentence can be passed to 17 years, and amendments Nos. 13 and 23 are fall-back amendments empowering the Home Secretary by order to increase the minimum age on which both youth custody and detention centre sentences can be passed preferably to 17 years. Amendments Nos. 13 and 23, if accepted by the Government, would enable them to announce now quite clearly that they agree with the principle of ending the incarceration of juveniles in prison department establishments. They acknowledge quite realistically that they cannot, because of the resources element involved, proceed to end the incarceration of them immediately, but will do so by progressive stages.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 13 and 23, therefore, enable an enlightened, radical and progressive Government, as the present Government wish to appear to be, to nail their colours to the mast and give a clear indication of intent. For this reason I hope that the Minister will accept these two amendments.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
I say this because Parliament has already indicated that it agrees with the principle behind the amendments. Parliament has already stated in the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 that prison department custody should end for juveniles. Unfortunately, the provisions of that Act were never implemented by the then Labour Government, the succeeding Conservative Administration or, regretfully and disgracefully, by the previous Labour Administration. Instead, as many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have pointed out we have incarcerated an increasing number of juveniles in prison department establishments in the last decade and more.<br><br>
The number of juveniles sentenced to detention centres and to borstal training has increased dramatically. As has been pointed out, there has been a faster increase in the number sentenced to custody than the increase in the level of crime among juveniles.<br><br>
The DHSS report, which has already been quoted and will no doubt figure prominently in our proceedings, entitled " Offending by Young People: A Survey of Recent Trends", published in 1981, showed very clearly that the number of juveniles sentenced to detention centres and to borstal training has increased five-fold since 1965, whereas only one-fifth of this relates to the increase in crime among that age group in the same period. In the last 20 years we have managed to halve the number of adults sentenced to custody as a proportion of those convicted of indictable offences, while tripling the number of juveniles sentenced to custody.<br><br>
It is a remarkable turnabout. All the evidence overwhelmingly, from this country and from abroad, from within the Government and from outside, says that we should not put juveniles or young people into institutions. We should not put them into penal establishments. We should make every possible effort to remove them from the custodial system. Yet the overwhelming evidence is that our actual practice has been very different from the professed intentions of all governments. It is remarkably pointed out by the fact that we have managed to halve the number of convicted adults who are given custodial sentences, while at the same time we have tripled the number of juveniles sentenced to custodial punishment.<br><br>
We know, because the evidence is clear, that sentencing juveniles to prison department establishments is highly ineffective, certainly in terms of reforming their characters and preventing them from committing further offences. Every Member of the Committee will know the figure of 76 per cent, of those boys leaving detention centres who commit further offences within two years of their release. We are all familiar with the figure of 83 per cent, of those sentenced to borstal training who also commit further offences within two years of leaving. Prison department establishments do not seem to be particularly successful or effective in that one objective of preventing those sentenced to incarceration in detention centres or borstals from committing further offences. The figures demonstrate the failure and

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
the futility of sending juveniles to prison department establishments.<br><br>
The reasons for that failure are obvious. We are taking a juvenile away from his home environment, his social situation where the problems that may have given rise to the offence exist, where his roots are and where eventually he will have to be settled. We are taking him away from the environment to which eventually he will be returned and where he will have to attempt to cope with its problems. We are subjecting him to the unnatural, single-sex world of penal establishments.<br><br>
We all now acknowledge that that is not the way to deal with the deep-seated and fundamental problems of the young people, juveniles particularly, who, for one reason or another, get into trouble or are delinquent. Frequently their problems relate to their lack of educational attainment, their poor home background and uncaring parents and to their inability to find worthwhile occupations. It is those problems with which we have to deal. We do not solve any of them by simply brushing aside those juveniles and institutionalising them. We certainly do not do it very effectively when it costs us £150 a week.<br><br>
I accept what the Minister says, that there is a small minority of juveniles and young people who are dangerous to the public, who commit horrifying and horrendous offences and from whom the public has a right to be protected. I accept that there is a need therefore for a limited amount of secure accommodation able to contain that small minority —the Minister's words which I endorse—of juveniles and young offenders who are dangerous, but that accommodation should not be provided by the penal system.<br><br>
The Advisory Council on the Penal System in its report "Young Adult Offenders" strongly recommended that those under the age of 17 should be dealt with separately from those over the age of 17. Paragraph 89 of that report was extremely emphatic on the different needs, the different orientation, and the different problems of juveniles and young persons over the age of 17 and under the age of 21. It emphasised the need to treat them differently and separately. It actually said that it did not accept that both ages could be dealt with successfully in the same institution, in the same accommodation.<br><br>
Despite that very strong paragraph 89 of the report of the Advisory Council on the Penal System, youth custody as provided for in the Bill takes 15 to 21-year olds together, lumps schoolchildren and young adults together—schoolchildren who may, after a youth custody sentence, be going back to school and back to full time education, whose orientation and emphasis is perhaps still that of a schoolchild. They are put together with and alongside young adults who are thinking in adult terms and who have a totally different attitude and orientation. Yet under the new youth custody sentence, all the schoolchildren and young adults are lumped together and treated together. Those who actually run the system rather than theorise about it, disagree with the principles as enshrined in the Bill and would support the amendment. The Prison
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
and Borstal Governors Association, for example, in its comments on the previous Government's Green Paper, pleaded for a specific date for the ending of junior detention centre sentences. Again, in its comments of this Government's White Paper, it repeated its commitment for the ending of detention of juveniles in prison department establishments. It is a principle supported by the representative organisations of probation officers and of social workers. Not only that, it is supported by the Police Federation, which has indicated that it supports the principle behind these amendments provided that an alternative of secure accommodation is made possible for the small minority of juveniles who are dangerous and from whom the public should be protected.<br><br>
The Government too, in another form of incarceration, have actually accepted the principle behind these amendments. The Northern Ireland Office, following the Black report, published in 1979, now does not accommodate juveniles in prison department establishments. The Government deserve a great deal of commendation and credit for the radical and far-sighted approach that they are operating in respect of juvenile and many other penal matters in Northern Ireland—a credit that is not always given, as it should be, by the Opposition or indeed by many other people involved in penal matters. The Government have acknowledged that it is wrong and inappropriate to incarcerate juveniles in prison department establishments and have therefore set up a totally new and independent system. If the principle can be accepted as desirable for application in Northern Ireland, it can be done and accepted in England and Wales.<br><br>
Most people who know anything about our juvenile system oppose the disastrous trend of the increase in the numbers sent to prison department establishments. The Government have the opportunity today, by accepting these amendments, to reverse that trend and try to remove juveniles from the prison custodial system. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will feel able, if not to accept amendment No. 12—which perhaps goes much further than any Government can be expected to go at this stage—will nevertheless feel able to accept the spirit behind amendments Nos. 13 and 23, and begin that long but necessary process of ending once and for all the scandal of putting schoolchildren into penal establishments.</span></p>

By way of explanation for that perhaps frivolous beginning, I hasten to say that these proposed amendments would wreck the whole scheme of detention centres as a " short, sharp shock", in the words of the Home Secretary, for those under the age of

17 who offend. I am at a loss to understand how, in an age in which a large part of crime is committed by those under 17, it is possible for the hon. Member for Ormskirk to have made the speech which he just made. The figures that my hon. and learned Friend quoted in his concluding speech on clause stand part show the gravity of crime by the under 17s. I shall not add to the wealth of statistics to which I contributed not a little in the course of the debates that have already taken place, but there are two passages on page 77 of the criminal statistics for 1980 that I shall read. They are only two sentences. Paragraph 5.21 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Throughout the 10-year period 1970-80 the highest rate of known offending per 100,000 population was amongst males aged 14 and under 17 for whom the rate was 71 per 100 population."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5.23 adds:
<br><blockquote><p>"In 1980, as in recent years, 15 years was the age for males and 14 the age for females at which the number found guilty or cautioned per 100,000 population was at its peak."</p></blockquote>

I do not see how, in the light of those grave facts—I do not think any Labour Member would dissent from the proposition that they are grave facts—anyone could seek to remove from authority one of the many means of dealing with this situation which will be open to the court and which will be provided by the new proposals with regard to detention centres. Instead of that, in a sweeping condemnation of the Government's proposals, the hon. Member for Ormskirk has trotted out the old, trite, specious, tired explanation that all these poor young psople under 17 are deprived, ill-educated and suffering from the evils of our society.<br><br>
The facts speak for themselves. I know this is a world-wide problem. We have gone into that before, but in the 1930s when there was far more misery than there is today, when there was no Welfare State, crime was at nothing like these levels and on the whole we were an ordered and disciplined society. It is impossible to draw the conclusion, without any evidence, that crime by the young is the fruit of deprivation. It is no doubt an element in it. We all accept that, but it is only one element and I fear that greed, adventure and sheer indiscipline are among the other causes.<br><br>
Greed, adventure and sheer indiscipline call for punishment. They call for deterrents and we should be failing our duty to society and the country if we did not provide the very modest measure of deterrents and punishment that are provided in clause 2.<br><br>
One final word and then I shall sit down. It never ceases to astonish me that those Opposition Members who so repeatedly urge us to be tender with young offenders at whatever expense to society, are the same people who most strongly urged upon the House of Commons that 18 should be the age of majority. " At 18 a man and a woman are mature," they say. "At 18 they are fit to serve on a jury." That may be one of the causes of so many perverse
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
verdicts today, but that is not a path on which I shall travel now. At 18 young people are able to look after their own affairs and vote for their Member of Parliament and in local government elections, yet at 17, within a year of attaining all the rights and duties of a citizen, they are to be treated utterly differently from anyone else who offends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One major reason for reducing the age of majority to 18 was that we made people of that age subject to conscription. They were obliged to risk their lives for their country, and would be again, and if people are being asked to put their lives in jeopardy, are not they entitled to have a vote in matters relating to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never found that the citizens of this country were ever reluctant to fight for their country when they were not able to sk on juries. In my conversations with many young people, I have found that they have said that at 18 they are not sufficiently emotionally mature and versed in the world to sit on juries. That is another matter and I shall not debate that now.<br><br>
I wholly reject the specious argument of the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) that because at 18 one is fit to fight, one is fit to have all the other rights and duties of a citizen. That is not the point. The point I am making is that if, at 18, one has all this maturity, surely at 17 one is not to be treated as we once treated children of under 14.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Pitt <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the remarks of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) as one whose fate it was to do National Service without a vote. If people of 18 are to fight and to die for their country, why should not they have a vote?<br><br>
That was not the argument put by the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), neither did he put the argument that these people are deprived or ill-educated. What he was saying, quite clearly, was that we should be looking carefully at how we are to treat young offenders in society and how to correct them at various stages of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor <span class='memberconstituency'> (Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that what the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) was actually attempting to do was to deprive the courts of one of the alternative methods of dealing with an offender and not, in fact, as the hon. Gentleman was suggesting, to increase the scope of the courts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I was not intending to increase the scope of the courts. Neither do I think that the hon. Member for Ormskirk has tried to deprive the courts of one way of dealing with an offender. He was trying to look at the situation, as I am trying to look at it, in relation to the ages of young people and in relation to the effective punishment and correction of these young peoples' crimes.<br><br>
It is most important that we look at how we correct young peoples' crimes. First, we talk about meaningless, senseless thuggery and acts of violence. Perhaps Conservative Members know that only 6
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
per cent. to 7 per cent. of crimes of violence are committed by young people. Secondly, if we commit —I suggest that this is the most important part of the argument—young people at such an early age—the age of 14—to custody, then we are putting them on the road recidivism. In the first place, many of these young people at 14 may have already been in care and we start institutionalising again that road to recidivism. We should be looking at more sensible ways of dealing with the matter, treating these young people and making them fit to take their place in society.<br><br>
We are told that 40 per cent. of crime is committed by those under 21. Perhaps we should also take into account some of the components of that figure. For example, acts of criminal damage defined, as hon. Members will surely know, as damage exceeding £20, rose from 17,000 in 1969 to 124,000 in 1977 and are still rising.<br><br>
Surely, inflation has a very clear part to play in that. We should look at the other reasons for the increase in crime figures, apart from the fact, as the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) would ceaselessly tell us, that crime figures are increasing inexorably. Crime figures have also increased by administrative measures, such as reclassification of offenders, the changes in police recording and, indeed, a public tendency to report more crime. We will not achieve any sensible result and any sensible provisions in this Bill if we continually go down the path of reacting to crime statistics.<br><br>
I have said before, and other hon. Members on both sides of this Committee have said, that it appears quite conclusively that sentences of detention, borstal training and imprisonment are not having any effect at all upon the crime rate. The borstal and detention centre recidivism percentages have been mentioned in this Committee so many times that I shall not bore the Committee again by repeating them. The hon. Member for Ormskirk made an excellent point when he suggested that if one gives a child of 14 a custodial sentence, one is sentencing a school child to custodial sentence. If that custodial sentence is less than two years, that young person will come out from that custodial sentence and will go back to school.<br><br>
I do not know how many hon. Members have or have had children of 14, but I can assure them from my experience that, for example, my daughter should not be left with much older young people of, say, 17, 18 and 19. The mixing of 14 and 15 year-old children with older youths of 17, 18 and 19 is the most stupid and inappropriate method of correcting these young peoples' crimes. It is reflected in this Bill. We are not giving sentences for women under 17. There is no detention centre proposed for women under 17. Why should we not, therefore, have a blanket age for male and female offenders—in these days of so-called sexual equality—of 17?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree entirely with that. We are talking about people up to 17 being children, yet in fact, a young woman of 16 can have sex with a man with consent. That cannot be described as a child, can it?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to discuss the merits of a young person of 16 having sex with a man. My own particular view is that a young person of 16 may or may not be mature enough to have sex.<br><br>
In this case I am talking about a young boy of 14 or 15 incarcerated in a custodial sentence with young men of 17, 18, 19 or 20. The difference between boys of 14 and young men of 20 is considerable and quite inappropriate for this situation. It is also widely accepted that a young person who has stayed out of custody until he or she is 21, but may have come before the courts after committing an offence has a much better chance of taking a proper place in society. We should look very carefully before we institutionalise recidivism further. The object of this Bill, and I believe, the Government's object, is to reduce the number of people in our prisons and to provide proper and adequate correction for the offences committed by these young people. It is based upon the fact that we should think not of incarcerating people but of people taking their place in society and being useful members of the community. I do not believe that this can happen if we have custodial sentences for boys over 14. This is another step along the downward path to institutionalising the kind of figures that we have heard repeatedly in this Committee. It is committing these people to a life of crime, imprisonment and incarceration. We have high recividism rates all through the age groups and it would be folly if the Committee were to accept the age of 14 as an age when custodial sentences could be applied to young people. I sincerely hope that the Government will see their way to accepting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to be very short. I put my name to the amendment because it deals with the age limits for detention centre. It does not deal with persons sent for custodial punishment generally, persons sentenced to jury service or, indeed, persons who may or may not lawfully be able to take part in sexual intercourse. It is solely concerned with the proper age at which a male young person ought to be allowed to be sentenced to a detention centre type of sentence. I emphasise " male " because it does not apply to females.<br><br>
I am very interested in the figures quoted by the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) which told us, if I remember correctly, that a higher proportion of offences are committed by young girls of 14 as distinct from young boys of 15. Despite that, the Government think it fit to remove from the possibility of a court to sentence all young females under the age of 17.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the logic of that is that the type of regime of a detention centre is suitable for boys. A great many people would doubt whether it was suitable for girls.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister agree with the point just made by his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) that it is

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
suitable for boys and not for girls? Has any research been done to show that it is unsuitable for girls or terribly suitable for boys?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always in the difficulty, when faced with that question, of knowing precisely what "the regime " is supposed to be. We are in what I think is supposed to be still an experimental period where we are experimenting with the short, sharp shock. That does not universally apply and the Home Secretary, I gather, will look at the results of that over a period of time and decide whether to extend it or to abolish it. I doubt whether he will abolish it before the next general election, or at any rate announce the abolition before then, so we have two different regimes.<br><br>
For my part, I do not understand why a regime of whatever character it is—the ordinary detention centre or the short, sharp shock type—which is considered unsuitable for girls should be considered none the less suitable for boys of the same age.<br><br>
I was referring to the statistics quoted by the hon. and learned Member for Solihull. He nodded, I think to indicate his assent, that I had correctly construed what he was saying about the figures. The hon. and learned Gentleman was putting those figures forward in the context of the very small minority of young, violent and difficult offenders in respect of whom he took the view that it was essential that even between the ages of 14 and 17 the detention centre option should be available. I find it very difficult to understand why, if that kind of regime is necessary for young boys between the ages of 14 and 17, it is thought to be unsuitable for girls.<br><br>
Putting it the other way round, if it is accepted as unsuitable for girls, why should it be thought suitable for boys of the same age, even although we now know, as the hon. and learned Gentleman said, that girls are prone to be within the very class a year earlier than boys?<br><br>
The amendment does not rule out the possibility of a custodial sentence for boys between 14 and 17. It does no more than say that we take the view that between those ages, and up to the age of 17, the particular type of regime, whichever character it may be, is not one that a court should be allowed to sentence a young boy specifically to.<br><br>
I said in an earlier debate that there is nothing to prevent a Home Secretary from creating different regimes within a youth custody system as he can and does within the present system. While I am by no means enamoured of the short, sharp shock regime, nonetheless I recognise that there could well be a different regime for a very short sentence, as is implicit in the detention centre type of sentence of up to four months and no more, from the regime where the sentence may be a longer one of up to 12 months.<br><br>
Within the context of the penal system for young offenders, one can have different regimes without putting in the power of the court at the point of sentence, when it may be most affected by the sort of consideration I mentioned in the earlier debate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
In other words, the court may consider the prevalence of a particular offence in a particular area and the emotional factors that inevitably become involved rather than the needs of the particular young person, and may at that stage make the distinction which says " You must go for one type of regime or another".<br><br>
This is why I have put my name to this amendment. I support the principle that the youth custody order should be generally available and that the court's power in relation to young people up to the age of 17 should be the same as it is in relation to adult centres, that is, to sentence to a generic custodial penalty, leaving it to those who deal with the question of allocation to look at the history, background and the type of person being dealt with to decide the best system to meet his particular needs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I support the spirit and principle behind the amendment. All the evidence available points to the fact that young boys aged 14 would not benefit from being sent to a detention centre where they would be under the influence of older boys or boys with a more determined attitude to crime. In that respect I cannot see why it should be in their interests to send boys of that age to a detention centre, particularly one with a short, sharp shock regime, whatever that might be.<br><br>
I have never really discovered the exact benefits of that regime, although hon. Members, particularly the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), seem well into it. They seem to know exactly what benefits, from the point of view of the public as a whole and from the point of view of the youngster himself, it confers.<br><br>
I do not know why the hon. and learned Member for Solihull was so offended by what my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) said. My hon. Friend said nothing new and nothing that is not the truth. If is a fact that the vast majority of young offenders come from disadvantaged, poor and deprived backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact, but not a cause. That is the logical fallacy in so much of the argument from the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least the hon. and learned Member agrees that it is a fact. That is something that we have managed to drag out of him, because the implication of his remark is that my hon. Friend's suggestion that there was such a fact was an irrelevancy and something which should have no part in consideration by the court. That is manifestly an absurdity. However, my hon. Friend and my right hon. and learned Friend have made the point strongly. It would be gilding the lily to enter into the same arguments about reconviction rates. I do not think that anything I say will convince the hon. and learned Gentleman. However, I should like to stress that I support my hon. Friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We begin with a measure of common ground in the Committee in that the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) fairly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0210">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
accepted what I had previously said, that there is a hard core of dangerous young offenders in the 14 to 17 age band for which special arrangements must be made. He accepts that they cannot be permitted to retain their liberty. The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), with his practical experience of these matters, also accepts that. His point is that youth custody is the right way to deal with these people. His view is " Do not give the courts the power to say that they should go to a detention centre with its special regime, leave it to the people who have charge of these juveniles sentenced to* youth custody to determine what kind of regime it shall be."<br><br>
However, there is a gulf between those two approaches and that of the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr- Pitt), who says that it is quite wrong for anybody in the juvenile age band of 14 to 17 to be sent away at all. I cannot express any sympathy with the latter argument, save that it comes from springs of benevolence and idealism, but the practical consequences of dealing with this hard core of dangerous young offenders in the judgment of the Government demands that we provide for the safety of the public with a custodial measure.<br><br>
That is recognised even in the amendment, because it leaves untouched the power of the courts to send to detention for long periods, measured in years, those juveniles as well as young adult offenders convicted of grave offences. Section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 permits a court to order detention for a long period of a juvenile convicted of a grave offence. That is left untouched by the amendment, and rightly so because nobody could visualise its being compatible with the safety of the public to remove that power.<br><br>
Therefore, it is a matter of judgment whether, for other than grave offences, the threshold for custody should be 17, as amendment No. 12 proposes, or 14, or somewhere in between. Amendment No. 13 seeks to give power to the Secretary of State to fix a threshold at 15 or 16. It is, therefore, a matter of judgment.<br><br>
In our judgment, and for the reasons that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) gave, nothing in the pattern of criminal offending since 1948, when detention centres were first, as it were, invented, indicates that there is no longer a need for a brief period of custody at least for 14- to 17-year olds—brief as possible, hence the provision in the Bill to reduce the minimum sentence to three weeks if courts decide to give as little as that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point, if I understood the Minister correctly he has not appreciated that for a girl under 17 there is no custodial sentence available under four months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right because as the hon. Lady will recall there used to be a detention centre for girls and that was closed in the early 1960s and no detention centre is now available. I will not enter onto her favourite tilting ground of the equality of the sexes. It is a fact that there is no detention centre available for them. Under the Bill, from

the age of 15 onwards it will be open for a court to sentence them for between 4 and 12 months of youth custody.<br><br>
12.30 <br><br>
Regrettably, it is more necessary that we should retain detention centres for this age band because the incidence of serious crime committed by this age group worsens. We made that clear in our White Paper. Accordingly, to accept amendment No. 13 would merely be to incorporate into the statute book what would be no more than a hope, an aspiration that things are going to get better and that the criminality pattern will improve. We hope that it will improve. If it does, the courts can take notice of it and adjust their sentences accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I waited until the Minister had finished his sentence. Could he answer a question which genuinely puzzles me and which arises both from our previous debates and from what he has just said. Which type of sentence, apart from the question of length, does he consider to be more serious, a detention centre sentence or a youth custody sentence? Assuming that the length of period were on equal terms between the two, does he regard one as being a graver penalty than the other. If so which, and for what reason?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think they are to be measured in terms of gravity. I believe that they are to be measured in terms of what is appropriate. The detention centre sentence is characterised by its particular regime. It is also to be characterised by the fact that it will have a maximum of four months. Youth custody is appropriate for those for whom four months should be the minimum period of the detention. Therefore, we hold to the view that the detention centre order must remain available, subject to the safeguards already on the statute book—nothing else non-custodial must be appropriate—and subject to the improvement that a very short period may now be ordered if the Bill is enacted.<br><br>
It is entirely right to be concerned about the increase in the proportion of custodial sentences that have recently been passed, but as I have said before, I think that that owes something to a certain lack of confidence in the range of non-custodial sentences at present available. The Bill improves that range with increased provision for supervision orders with community service orders for 16-year-olds, and with the residential care order to enable somebody not to have to be sent into custody when he has already committed a further serious offence while in care. The Government's increased provision of attendance centres also will help here.<br><br>
While I understand the concern about the increased proportion of custodial sentences awarded to 14- to 17-year-olds, I must firmly advise my hon. Friends not to support this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down, will he answer the point raised by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich? I know

that he does not like to discuss discrimination against women, but in this case it is discrimination against boys, and it is not often that I get up and point out discrimination against the male sex. Here we have a sentence which is considered, in the words of the Government, as appropriate and suitable for boys but not appropriate or suitable for girls of the same ages—14 and 15, and very young ages—charged with similar types of offences. My right hon. and learned Friend and I should like to know what evidence is there that a different regime is necessary for the boys than for the girls Are there any statu- stics to show that this regime is unsuitable for the girls? As far as I know, there have never been detention—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Lady is saying that if detention centres are so marvellous, why do we not again start up detention centres for girls? There is a much lower incidence of offending by girls within this age span—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Lady is getting herself into a state of rare excitment, but I am trying to answer her questions to which she clearly attaches some importance. For some reason or other, and it is hardly for me to enter upon the dangerous ground of suggesting a reason, girls commit offences much less than boys.<br><br>
I would not wish to suggest any reason why that should be so. I am particularly grateful for the fact that it happens. We do not believe, therefore, that it would be right to open a special detention centre for them. I do not believe that the hon. Lady would think it very good to have a co-ed detention centre. One reason alone, which is sufficient for not opening a detention centre for girls, is that there are not enough girls committing offences to justify such an action.<br><br>
There is no reason to suggest that there is some hidden sexism here. There really is not, unless it is to acknowledge, with gratitude, that girls do not commit offences as often as boys. Some of them do but that is the general position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel that my hon. Friend might also take into account the advisability of having a lot of pregnant young ladies playing rugger in the afternoon for the good of their health.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I shall want at a later stage to draw attention to the immediate medical examination that takes place when anyone goes into a detention centre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am making an intervention or a second speech, but on this point the Minister has ingeniously turned round the point that I was putting. I shall put it again my way rather than the way that he put it.<br><br>
If it is not considered necessary to have the power in the courts to sentence a girl between the age of 14 and 17, however tough she may be—to use the Minister's words—however difficult she may be, or however much it may be thought that a detention centre type regime would be appropriate in the case of a similar, but male person, why is it thought necessary in the case of a male person of that age?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that I had expressed the reason quite clearly. There is not much point in having a power if there is nowhere to put them. We do not have anywhere to put them, so we do not want the power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I am intervening or making a speech, but I suggest to the Minister that what he is really saying is— <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is a man of great versatility—he can talk to the civil servants and listen at the same time.<br><br>
Is not the Minister saying that detention centres are appropriate for girls but that the Bill ensures that inappropriate sentences, in his view, will be given to girls because there is no detention centre to put them in and it is not worth creating one for them? In effect, the Government are saying that girls up to the age of 17 will be given inappropriate sentences. Is that the Government's position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been several references by Opposition Members, and also by the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), to the social deprivation of many of the juveniles who are given custodial sentences. I did not say, nor would my hon. Friends pretend, that social deprivation is the cause of delinquency or crime among young people. Of course, it is a fact, and a well-demonstrated fact—clearly indicated in the research studies, not only of the Home Office, but also of the DHSS—that we must recognise. It may not be the cause of crime and delinquency, but certainly it is a factor leading towards criminality.<br><br>
To put it at its very lowest, there is a very high correlation between social deprivation and juvenile offending. If we want to deal with crime and to reduce the incidence of crime, I suggest that we must deal with its causes rather than, as we are in this Bill, with its symptoms. The Minister is suggesting that we should not attempt to identify the causes of crime or juvenile delinquency, that we should not, having identified them, attempt to eradicate them and deal with the social problems of those with a propensity to offending, but that we should instead deal with the symptoms, which happen to be the juveniles who are offenders, and put them into penal dustbins. That is not the way to deal with the real problem of those individuals or indeed to reduce the level of criminality in society.<br><br>
The vast majority of the juveniles we are talking about in these amendments are not, as the Minister has acknowledged, dangerous offenders. They have not been convicted of serious offences against the person. It was the Minister himself who cited the figure of only 7 per cent, of juveniles who are convicted of serious crimes such as robbery, violence or sex. There is no reason, therefore, why we should not be able to> provide separate custodial institutions away from the penal system,, able to hold in secure conditions that minority of juveniles who are a danger to the public.<br><br>
There is nothing at all revolutionary in what I have been arguing and in what is entailed in these amendments. The principle was accepted in 1969 in the Children and Young Persons Act that we

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
should not send juveniles to prison department establishments. That is now accepted by this Government in the operation of their policy in Northern Ireland, and by the Opposition Front Bench, whose signatures are appended to this amendment.<br><br>
We have a clear statement from the Opposition, too, that they wish to see the ending of custodial sentences in prison department establishments being given to juveniles. One would therefore, expect the next Labour Government to implement the principle established in amendment No. 12. In view of the Minister's retreat from what appeared to be an acknowledgement on the part of the Government that they too wished to end the imprisonment of juveniles as it happens at the moment. I feel it necessary that we should proceed to a vote. I should, therefore, like my hon. Friends to join me in pressing amendment No. 12.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 39, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" (5A) For the purposes of determining whether the detention of an offender in a detention centre would be unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition the court shall obtain and consider a report into his mental and physical condition ".</p></blockquote>
This amendment would require the courts to obtain medical reports before making a detention centre order.<br><br>
Home Office circular No. 179/1972 drew the attention of the courts to the demanding nature of detention centres and their unsuitability for those with physical or mental handicaps. Despite this, however, the evidence we now have suggests that many boys who are far from fit or stable are sentenced to detention centres. The hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) will be very interested in the winter edition of the <i>Prison Medical Journal</i> in which there is an article by Dr. Black-house, who is the medical officer at Send detention centre, where the experimental short, sharp shock was introduced and who analysed the medical history of the boys who went through that detention centre.<br><br>
We have had references in our earlier debate to the fact that it has been suggested, not least by the hon. and learned Member for Solihull, that these boys were not socially deprived or medically or physically disabled. I notice that the hon. and learned Member for Solihull quickly whips, creeps or strides out of the room. Is he in or out? He has gone. The article is entitled <i>The Health of Detention Centre Boys</i> by Charles Backhouse, and analyses the medical histories of trainees at Send over an 11-year period. He found, first, that there was a higher incidence than expected of physical disease. Secondly,
<br><blockquote><p>" A history of depression, suicidal gestures and overdoses is common, the latter particularly so in the small group giving a history of drug abuse ".</p></blockquote>
The latter group constituted something like 11 or 12 per cent, of all trainees going through Send in that particular 11-year period. The doctor went on:
<br><blockquote><p>" Anxiety and depression, serious enough to require special observation and drug treatment, is found in about 5 per cent, of boys."</p></blockquote>
I acknowledge that those findings were published before the introduction of the new, experimental, so-called short, sharp shock introduced at Send and at New Hall detention centres in April 1980, but given that we have those experimental tougher regimes, it seems to me to be even more important that the courts should be aware of the physical and mental condition of the boys coming before them for potential detention centre sentences before those sentences are actually passed.<br><br>
Indeed, the Justices' Clerks' Society was, I think, the first to make that point, in its comments on the previous Government's White Paper and it recommended that a medical report should be available to the court in all cases before a detention centre order was passed, particularly if the regime was going to become much tougher. The same point was pressed upon the present Government by New
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
Approaches to Juvenile Crime and by Baroness Faithfull, both of whom have argued that it would be inappropriate if the courts were not enabled properly and fully to consider the full circumstances of an offender and certainly his medical condition if he is to be subjected to a regime of drill, parades and inspections.<br><br>
However, in spite of the representations made by the Justices' Clerks' Society, the distinguished penal reformer, Baroness Faithfull and New Approaches to Juvenile Crime the Government, who were introducing the experimental stage at New Hall and Send in April 1980, rejected that sensible and reasonable advice. Instead, they argued for and implemented a system whereby instead of the boy's medical history being taken into account before sentence was passed, he would be physically examined by the medical officer on reception in the detention centre.<br><br>
As a result between 21 April 1980, when the new regime came into operation at Send and at New Hall, and the present date, 81 boys have had to be transferred from New Hall and 107 have had to be transferred from Send because they were physically incapable of living up to the new tougher regime implemented at those institutions. It seems ludicrous, as a representative of the Prison Officers Association at Send detention centre pointed out, for the courts to ignore the clear medical inappropriateness of some young boys being sentenced to this tougher regime. The boys are sentenced to a detention centre and found by the medical officer to be unsuitable for the regime. They take up valuable space of which there is a great shortage and then have to be transferred elsewhere. It is an enormous bureaucratic delay, presumably at additional cost to the prison service and to the Home Office, and also highly inconvenient both to the young offender and to the institution to which he has been sent. It would be more sensible for all, not least for him, if the estimate of his suitability on medical grounds were made in the courts rather than at a detention centre.<br><br>
Having medical reports available to the courts, as suggested by the amendment, would enable the courts to pass the sentence that is appropriate to the offender. Conservative Members constantly chide the Opposition for wanting to restrict the court's discretion and for wanting to inhibit the court in some way, but with the amendment we are giving the courts greater information so that they can make a decision based upon more relevant facts than they have been doing in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend, from his knowledge, can tell the Committee what happens to these young people whom he has described who, having been sentenced to a detention centre are found on arrival to be unsuitable, mentally or physically, for serving such a sentence. Do they go to some other detention centre where presumably they are equally unsuitable? What happens to them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend is right. Those at New Hall do go to other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
detention centres; in other parts of the system they are sent to adult prisons. In either case it is inappropriate, as he and I agree, having voted for the previous amendment to remove at least the juveniles who are sentenced to detention centres.<br><br>
There is no reason why medical reports cannot become obligatory for all young offenders. As the Home Office said in 1972, one would have expected that under the previous regime. Now that the regimes are tougher it seems even more important that a proper medical examination should be carried out and a report conveyed to the court. It can be done quickly by police surgeons acting in their private capacity. Therefore there is no reason why the Government should feel unable to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government cannot accept the recommendation and I shall briefly explain why. The court must address itself to the physical and mental condition of a young offender if it is minded to make this sort of order. The amendment imposes a cumbersome procedural requirement on the court, which will not only contribute to delay and expense, but could result in the young offender being held in adult prisons before going into a detention centre. If he has to be remanded for a medical report, he may be sent to an adult prison. The Bill already goes a long way in circumscribing the discretion of a court which has it in mind to make a detention centre order. First, it has to be of the opinion that no other method of dealing with the offender is appropriate and, in deciding that, the court must, under clause 1(6):
<br><blockquote><p>" take into account any information … which is relevant to his character and his physical and mental condition."</p></blockquote>
It is further prohibited by clause 2(5) from makinga detention centre order:
<br><blockquote><p>" if it considers that his detention in such a centre would be unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition."</p></blockquote>
The courts must be relied on to some extent to satisfy themselves that they have the information they need to come to a proper decision. They can obtain whatever medical, psychiatric or social inquiry reports that they ask for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the courts must be relied upon to make the correct decision to ensure that they get the information they need. How can that be the case? Clearly the courts are not doing that when in the two years since the short, sharp shock regime has been in operation 81 of the boys at New Hall and 107 at Send have been found by the medical officer at those detention centres to have been sentenced inappropriately by the courts. Is that not because the courts have failed to ensure that they had the proper and full information, not least on the medical condition, of the boys before them before they passed sentence? Does that not make the case for the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, if a young offender has been found unfit at a detention centre to undergo its regime, it follows that the court had not satisfied itself that he was unfit. What I said was that the courts must be relied upon to some extent to satisfy themselves that they have the information that they need to come to a proper decision. It is not a high
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0214">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
proportion that the hon. Gentleman has cited. Naturally there are some cases. One must arrive at the proper balance. Are we so to fetter the discretion of the courts, which would be the effect of the amendment, as to impose upon them an obligation in every case to have a medical report? Or do we say that the safeguards that are written into the legislation are enough to ensure that in most cases they will get it right and that we will rely for safety on the medical inspection that takes place straight away when the young offender arrives at the detention centre to make sure that nobody embarks upon a detention centre regime who is not physically or mentally fit for it?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
The balance is adequately established. I believe that it is a serious disadvantage of the amendment that the remand would in many cases have to be in an adult prison. I do not think that the hon. Member for Orsmkirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) would welcome that. We do not want unnecessary remands for young offenders in adult prisons for the purpose of a medical inspection—</span></p>
