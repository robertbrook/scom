<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Criminal Justice Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
On a morning on which the Hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) and I left the Chamber at about 3.45 am to go our separate ways, it is a particular delight that it should be under your Chairmanship, Mr. Dean, that we resume our duties now. On behalf the entire Committee I warmly welcome you to the Chair and I an quite certain that we shall not only benefit from, but enjoy, your wise guidance.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first amendment, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available on the table in the room.</span></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
RESTRICTION OF CUSTODIAL SENTENCES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S.C. Silkin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line, 1, leave out subsection (2).<br><br>
I think that the Government themselves would very much like to be able to leave out subsection (2) because it enables persons under 21 years of age, who are either remanded in custody or committed in custody for trial or sentence, to be committed to prison. As I understand it, the reason it is in the Bill is that the proper places for them to be remanded to— remand centres—are not available in sufficient numbers to cope with the number of persons under 21 who fall within this category. I am sure that the Government would not willingly wish any young person under the age of 21, who is being remanded for one reason or another, to have to spend his time in a prison with either adult persons on remand or adult persons who have been convicted.<br><br>
It must have been with considerable reluctance that the Government inserted this provision into the Bill. I doubt whether they would have done so but for the necessity arising out of the absence of remand centre places. The absence of adequate remand centre places is something that should be remedied as rapidly as possible.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to ascertain from the Government their intentions in the building of remand centres so that the provisions of this subsection will, one hopes before long, cease to be necessary and, indeed, perhaps in some future piece of legislation be removed altogether because it is clearly a subsection that one would prefer not to have in the law.<br><br>
I do not intend to speak long on this amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
because I have little doubt there will be at least a vast majority, if not unanimity, in support of the view that I have just expressed.<br><br>
It is necessary that the Government should explain their intentions. We have heard of proposals for the building of further prisons. I personally have not heard so much about proposals for the building of further remand centres, and I cannot help feeling that in many cases the sort of objection that arises to the building of new prisons would certainly not arise with the same force if one were considering the building of remand centres, the purpose of which would be to take young people who ought not to be there at all out of prisons.<br><br>
I have in mind, for example, the considerable controversy over the proposal to build another prison in Woolwich. I can well imagine that many who dislike that proposal—I would not suggest that they would all welcome with great enthusiasm the idea of having a remand centre there instead—would feel that if such a complex were erected, it could help to relieve the prison population of those who should not be there. There would be much less offence to the principle, which I hope all learned Members in this Committee will seek to uphold, that people who ought not to be there should be kept out of prison. There would be much greater sympathy for such a proposal than the proposal to erect a prison, which many people believe—whatever the best intentions of the Home Office—will, in practice, simply supplement the number of prisons rather than being used to remove the obsolete prisons that ought to be destroyed and demolished.<br><br>
In that category I would certainly count Brixton, to which Woolwich could well be a natural successor from the point of view of remand. I accept, of course, that Brixton is used for adult offenders, and I see no reason why remand centres should not be built as long as there is an adequate separation between the adults and young persons housed there.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will be able to give some encouraging news on this point. It is most important that one should concentrate on the provision of this kind of establishment rather than on the provision of more prisons. Equally, in their building programme, the Government should be concentrating more and more on the type of building that is not a prison, or necessarily even custodial in character, rather than in simply building more and more of prisons to house a greater and greater proportion of the population. It is in that spirit, and not in the desire to create a hole in the Bill in the place of something which, I accept, unhappily needs to be there at the moment, that I move the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my right honourable and learned Friend's attempt to amend the Bill so as to prevent the remanding of all offenders under the age of 21 to adult prison establishments. That particular proposition is desirable in itself in principle, and one that every member of the Committee would normally support. However, it is only fair and reasonable to point out —I am sure my right hon. and learned Friend will not mind my saying this—th many of the remandat centres to which these young offenders would other

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
wise be sent if they could not be remanded to other prisons tend to have some of the most appalling conditions in the prison system as a whole.<br><br>
As my right hon. and learned Friend pointed out, it is important to try to segregate young offenders from adult offenders and to put them in remand centres rather than in adult prisons. If we are to achieve that objective it will be necessary for the Government to reduce substantially and quickly the number of those remanded in custody. Indeed, if the Government were to accept many of the other amendments that have been tabled in my name and the names of my right hon. and learned Friends, they would be able to end the practice of remanding to adult prisons, either for trial or for sentence, those offenders who are aged 21 or under.<br><br>
A large number of people are remanded to remand centres and to adult prisons every year. About 58,000 individuals enter prisons in custody on remand, awaiting trial or sentence, of whom well over 44 per cent, will eventually be found to be not guilty or will be given a non-custodial sentence, yet all of whom will have already, in effect, served a prison sentence, albeit in many cases of a very short duration. That, as the May Committee pointed out, is a scandal that has been alluded to in this House on many occasions, but one which the Government have as yet done very little to deal with.<br><br>
It is also a scandal that so many people who should otherwise be given bail rather than a taste of imprisonment, spend such inordinately long periods of time in custody. On any one day, Mr. Dean, it may surprise you—it may surprise the people outside this House, but it will not surprise the Minister—to know that about 900 individuals on remand in custody awaiting trial have been there for more than 110 days, a situation that cannot happen in Scotland. If we can substantially reduce, as we should, the numbers remanded into custody, and the length of time which they are so remanded, it will be possible to implement both the spirit and practice of my right honourable and learned Friend's amendment. In supporting it I should like to learn from the Minister why it is not possible to accept the amendment and to carry out in practice what we all agree is desirable in principle. When will it be practicable to introduce this particular proposition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not the right hon. and learned Gentleman is right in attributing to the Government the covert wish to abandon subsection (2), the fact remains that there is great residual public anxiety even about the provisions of subsection (1), that no person under the age of 21 can under any circumstances ever be sent to prison.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman moved very glibly across the boundaries of adulthood, young persons and so on. He traded these familiar phrases, but the fact remains that maturity is recognised under the law as occurring at 18, when commercial, economic, financial and, indeed, electoral responsibilities are now recognised by the State as coming to pass.<br><br>
Why is this the only remaining area where this division between young persons and adults is maintained in the sight of the law? It is particularly significant in this context, because many of the most
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
objectionable and shocking crimes are committed people aged between 18 and 21.<br><br>
No one would suggest for a moment that it is anything but shocking and undesirable that real, genuine adolescents and teenagers, and young people should ever be committed to prison, but as the law now recognises every other measure of responsibility at 18, would not it be much easier if 18 were also recognised as the limit in this case? My own view is that it would make it much easier for the right hon. and learned Gentleman's amendment to be accepted.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) for the fair and realistic way in which he explained the amendment and, because he is much too experienced, he is not asking for what he described as a hole to be punched in the Bill so that courts would have no means of remanding to prison today, those under the age of 21.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows that that would be impracticable.<br><br>
The existing so-called remand centres are not remand centres designated under the statute, because they do not comply with the strict and inflexible requirements that the 1952 Act requires for designated remand centres. We call them remand centres but they are not remand centres designated in law.<br><br>
Leaving those on one side, about 700 young offenders under the age of 21 are at present remanded in prison. It simply would not be possible, even were we able to wave a wand and turn the existing remand centre so-called accommodation into remand centre accommodation properly designated, to cope were this amendment to be carried.<br><br>
Naturally, the Government prefer that young offenders who have to be remanded in custody should wherever possible be remanded in accommodation that is restricted to people of their own age.<br><br>
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) that there is now a unique distinction between the age at which maturity—in the sense that he described it—is assumed to occur.<br><br>
Many hon. Members might think that for some of the activities that are now permitted at that age, 18 is possibly on the young side. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) interjected that jury service was fairly controversial at 18, but I shall go no further down that road.<br><br>
The Government would not wish to reduce from 21 the age at which special statutory requirements have been imposed for a long time in respect of either the imprisonment or the remanding of young offenders.<br><br>
Clause 9 seeks to relax some of the inflexible requirements that the 1952 Act imposes on establishments which are to be used as remand centres. That will enable us to move some way down the road that I have described. Unhappily, the prison system is so stretched that it will be quite impossible in the near future—and, regretfully, even in the medium term— to ensure that all young offenders under the age of 21 remanded in custody will be able to be remanded in designated remand centres.<br><br>

However, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced at the end of last year the largest prison building programme of this century, and I am able to say that some progress will be made.<br><br>
The prison department is currently considering future strategy for remand centres. It is most likely to opt for siting these in urban locations. The re-designation of parts of local prisons is a viable option provided, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, there is proper separation within the prison establishment between the part that would be used, whether it be a wing or some other portion, for remand centre purposes, and the remainder to be used for prison purposes.<br><br>
He mentioned Woolwich prison. When we had the debate on prisons last November, I mentioned that we hoped to push ahead with the new prison for London in Woolwich, but there is considerable local opposition, prominent in which is the hon. Member for Woolwich, East (Mr Cartwright). That is the kind of trouble the Government face when seeking to enlarge the available accommodation and, therefore, reduce overcrowding.<br><br>
I sympathise with the spirit of the amendment but, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman recognised, it is impossible for us to accept it, not least because at present the law deems that all remand accommodation should be in prisons. Therefore, there would be nowhere for the courts to send people whom they wished to remand in custody. The Committee will recognise, in sheer realism, that the courts must have power in certain cases to remand in custody certain young offenders. I entirely understand the purpose which has been fairly expressed by the right hon. and learned Gentleman in moving the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister's last statement correct? Does he mean that there are no secure places in community homes where children under the age of 17 are remanded in custody?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am accurately corrected by the hon. Gentleman. I should have said for those between the ages of 17 and 21.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. and learned Gentleman give an indication of when he expects the first remand centre to be completed? He has mentioned a programme for it. Can he be a little more specific?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will. I said that some progress can be expected on remand accommodation and I indicated the lines along which the prison department is thinking at present. I must make it clear that in the present building programme no remand centre accommodation as such is envisaged. However, the programme provides for 500 places at Feltham to replace the existing facilities at Ashford. It would take years to work up a further programme for new remand centre places and there are competing demands, for example, for training accommodation for young offenders.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point because the hon. and learned Gentleman has emphasised the Government's prison building programme. I should like to know his view of the remarks of the Director of NACRO, Ms. Stern, whose impression is that the new places will largely replace existing places. The Minister has just said that the remand programme is a replacement programme. Will he clarify what are replacement places and what are new places?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No secret has been made of the fact that there must be a substantial prison building programme simply to replace the accommodation that is falling down. In the debate last November I itemised year-by-year the new prison places that were lost because of the cuts made by the last Government. We have a long road to travel in that particular direction. I must ask the Committee to reject this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the information he has given to us, prompted by this amendment. It is disappointing to hear that the prison building programme at the moment contains no remand centres at all. This I find difficult to square with the philosophy, which the Government share with many of us, that people should not be in prison if some other form of treatment, whether custodial or non-custodial, is more proper. We all agree that this applies in the case of those on remand.<br><br>
In so far as the prison building programme is intended to replace prisons that are obsolete, as so many of them are, and in some cases even falling down, one would have hoped that the programme could accommodate at least to some degree the building of remand centres. That would serve precisely the same purpose of taking people out of prisons who should not be there, especially where the prison buildings are such that they ought not to be used.<br><br>
I mentioned the case of Brixton. That is a glaring example of a prison that is used entirely for remand apart from those prisoners who are there to service those on remand. Anyone who has seen it would agree that that prison has served its purpose. Why should not the prison building programme include at a very early stage the substitution of a remand centre for a prison such as Brixton, which is used for remandees? I do not understand why the Minister has told us that at the moment the prison building programme contains nothing of that kind, though he hopes that at some time in the future it will.<br><br>
I hope that my aim in introducing the amendment is not lost. We shall certainly pursue it now that we have had the information given to us by the Minister. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment and the others in effect say that no court shall make a detention centre order. It was emphasised during second Reading by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), myself and my hon. Friends that we feel that detention centre orders should now be discontinued and that they have been shown to be found wanting over many years. The Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1974 in its report "Young Adult Offenders" recommended that the three custodial sentences for young offenders—imprisonment, borstal and detention centre training—should be amalgamated into one youth custody system. It pointed out that there is not a very real and significant distinction any more—well there was not in 1974—between the regimes in borstals and detention centres. The distinction has become blurred and, indeed, misleading.<br><br>
The last Labour Government in their Green Paper " Youth Custody and Supervision " supported this concept of the three sentences being merged into one. It would involve pooling all three types of young offender establishment. From the practical point of view, that would make life a lot easier for the prison establishment which would be able to make the maximum use of all the accommodation available. It would also be easier to allocate offenders and run the prison.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The views of the Advisory Council on the Penal System and the last Government's Green Paper were generally welcomed. It is regrettable that the Government have now decided to retain what is a now discredited system. The single sentence would place more emphasis on training, education and rehabilitation of the young offender within the sentence of youth custody and supervision.<br><br>
To some extent, the concept of detention centres has been changed by the Government's latest short, sharp, shock experiment, which we regard as totally un necessary—<br><br>
[Hon. Members: " Oh".] It is unnecessary, because it has already been done.<br><br>
In 1970, the Advisory Council on the Penal System reported that it had already analysed the effects of this short, sharp, shock approach that accompanied the setting up of the centres in the 1950s and 1960s. It showed that it did no good to either the offenders or the staff running the detention centres. The vast
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
majority of offenders, who are sent to these short, sharp, shock regimes, re-offend. There is no statistical evidence to support either its deterrent effect on other young people or its effectiveness on the offenders who actually go there. I would be interested if any Conservative Member has statistical evidence to the contrary, because I have not heard of or seen any. The regimes may, in fact, alienate young people because of their strictness and perhaps lead to more crime as a result.<br><br>
The Committee is now being asked to endorse the perpetuation of detention centres, both the ordinary kind and the short, sharp, shock experiment-kind that the Government have started.<br><br>
The New Hall and Send regimes were set up in April 1980. About 1,000 boys have now been through that latest experiment and come out. They have been out for almost a year. It seems extraordinary that we cannot have any preliminary figures about reconviction rates, or lack of them, among those 1,000 boys so that we can compare them with the re-conviction rates among young offenders who are not in detention centres.<br><br>
On the last occasion when the Home Secretary answered party questions, I asked whether we could have these figures. He said " Yes", but did not say when we would have them. If Parliament is being asked to endorse the short, sharp, shock experiment— endorse the continuation of detention centres within a new Act of Parliament—we really should have some figures. I think they could be available from this latest experiment.<br><br>
The fact remains that all detention centres, be they experimental or otherwise, are now totally discredited as a form of custody for young people by those people who actually work with offenders. It is hard to find anybody who works in this area—probation officers, social workers, magistrates—who supports the whole idea of detention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Ryman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is no practical value in the continuation of sentences to detention centres for either a three-month or a six-month period, and if people who work in these places think that they are not suitable for the purpose for which they were originally intended, why do magistrates continue to impose sentences to detention centres?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are Tories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As long as detention centres exist as part of our penal system and are a form of sentence, somebody, somewhere, will use that form of sentence. That is why we want to take them out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the hon. Lady's understanding, how does she account for the fact that the use made of the provision in the law for extended sentences over and above the maxima that are normal as fixed by Parliament, has declined so that it has become almost a dead letter over the last 10 years? It remains available to the courts, but they do not use it. That surely conflicts with the proposition just put forward.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the courts are using detention centres. We are simply concerned with the existence of the detention centre order as it exists at the moment, Young boys are being sent to these for whatever reason, and we consider that this form of custody is discredited and should be discontinued. This Bill should take advantage of the opportunity to do away with something that is retrograde and introduce a new—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What would the hon. Lady put in its place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill </span><span class='membercontribution'>:I spent the first part of my speech explaining that the Advisory Council on the Penal System and the last Government's Green Paper would substitute the present three custodial sentences for young offenders with one youth custody system. This is what we would put in its place—[Hon. Members: " Doing what? "] We hope they would do something more constructive than a short, sharp, shock regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is saying no more than what the Government are saying in the Bill, and this ought to be pointed out to Conservative Back Benchers. The Government are proposing that the sentence of borstal training and imprisonment become one sentence of youth custody. My hon. Friend is proposing that that youth custody be extended to a third sentence, that of a detention centre order. Those hon. Members who asked my hon. Friend what the offenders are going to do should address that question to their hon. and learned Friend who is proposing that youth custody sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady also explain why she thinks it would be so much better to put the younger offenders who are obviously suited for detention centres into the youth custody programme where the sentences will be longer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It depends on whether these young offenders are suited to detention centres. It is a very interesting point. How do we decide who is suited to a detention centre and who is not? We know that this method of custody results in the majority of people coming out and re-offending, so they were obviously questionably—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 86 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Sumerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says 86 per cent, which is a vast number to re-offend. Instead of having another experiment in the short, sharp, shock let us change over to a rehabilitation regime. We could train and educate people while they are in custody for their life outside. It certainly could not result in worse re-conviction rates than is the case with detention centres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percy Grieve <span class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) rightly says, these amendments desire to take the detention centre order out of the penal system and to abolish it. Her arguments pay tribute to her heart rather than to her head.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
For years the borstal governors have been saying that they have been receiving young men and women much too late. One of the problems of the courts—and it is a great problem—is that the first consideration of any court dealing with a youngster who has offended is whether it is possible to keep him out of custody. A custodial sentence at any stage of a criminal career is the last resort of the courts, and anyone in this Committee who has any experience of the courts will agree with that observation, which I make from a very long experience of sitting as a Recorder, a Chairman of Quarter Sessions and so on.<br><br>
One of the results of this has been that over the years youngsters have come before the courts again and again, been given chance after chance in the form of probation and so on, and in the end have inevitably been sent away for custodial sentences.<br><br>
Borstal governors have been driven to say that all too frequently they receive youngsters too late. After all, borstal and the detention centre have in the past been aimed at reform, the detention centre as the shock system, so that after a short sentence people will say to themselves " I am not going to offend again. I am not going to have that ". They also seek to provide training. However, these things do not work if they are applied too late.<br><br>
We all agree with the hon. Lady that the failure rate is considerable. Of course it is, because we all know that in modern society some people will not be reformed. One must look at the rate of success as well. If there is a rate of success, my submission to the Committee is that where detention centres have succeeded they have justified themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says we must look at their success. Can he give some statistical examples of the way these centres have succeeded?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the statistics at my fingertips. No doubt they will be canvassed during the debate and I shall certainly make it my business to ascertain them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman made an important point. He has chided my hon. Friend for denigrating the detention centre order and detention centres and has said that we should look to their successes and give credit where credit is due. I and my hon. Friend are asking him to tell us about the successes of the detention centres. I suggest that he does not know of any successes and that is why he has has not got the figures at his fingertips.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a fallacious point. The hon. Lady has already given an indication of the failure rate. The success rate is clearly what remains. The success rate is important. We are dealing with delinquency, crime and human nature. We all know that in reality a lot of people will not be reformed by anything. The fallacy of so much argument in the House of Commons and in Committees about crime is that people do not have regard to the realities of life today and the realities of human nature.<br><br>

I want to quote a few statistics of the crimes committed by young people under 17 and under 21. I ask the Committee to decide whether, in the light of those statistics, it is acceptable to us as a House of Commons and as a Committee, as well as to the public, that the only remaining weapon in our armoury for dealing with crime by juveniles and those under 21 should be the new youth custody, fine, probation and matters of that kind.<br><br>
The statistics are devastating and we should not fail to have regard to them. Page 98 of the report on criminal statistics for England and Wales contains a table of offenders found guilty at all courts. The figures are given for type of offence, sex and age. I shall deal only with the males and give the numbers of offenders in thousands.<br><br>
In 1980, there were 52,100 offences of violence against a person—1,500 committed by children under 14; 7,500 committed by those between 14 and 17 and 15,500 committed by those between 17 and 21. Of 75,800 burglaries, 11,500 were committed by those under 14; 32,300 by those between 14 and 17 and 19,700 by those aged between 17 and 21.<br><br>
11.15 am.<br><br>
Robbery has increased, it is most prevalent on the streets of our great cities and is one of the most serious crimes in the calendar of crime. Of 3,300 robberies in all, 200 were committed by those under 14, 600 by those between 14 and 17 and 1,100 by those between 17 and 21.<br><br>
I turn to less serious crimes, but serious all the same in the context of trying to preserve law and order in our society. Of 235,700 offences, theft and handling stolen goods, 32,600 were committed by those under 14, 55,300 by those between 14 and 17,and 52,600 by those between 17 and 21. Theft and handling stolen goods by those between 10 and 14 reached the figure of 32,600.<br><br>
It is relevant to consider criminal damage. Of 12,400 criminal damage offences, 2,000 were committed by those between 10 and 14, 2,800 by those between 14 and 17, and 3,700 by those between 17 and 21. I exclude the figures for girls, but the ones I have given are sufficiently explicit in themselves.<br><br>
The Committee must face the fact that there is an appalling problem, not merely of juvenile delinquency, which presupposes all sorts of petty crimes, but one of really serious crime being committed by those under 21 and, indeed, under 14 and 17.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that, if one compares violent crime with burglary, the figures are quite staggering?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The figures speak for themselves, and we must not run away from them. They require the most careful consideration as to how to deal with this most serious problem. For instance, in <i>The Times</i> on Tuesday, one read of three quite appalling crimes all committed by youngsters—I think, two were under 17 and one under 21. There is not only a lack of discipline but a tendency for greater and more serious crime to be committed by the young.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says that we have an appalling problem, and no one would deny it. Does he have figures for international comparison to show how appalling this country is compared with any other? He will find that generally in the Western world crime is on the increase and that our rate of increase is not out of line with the increase in many other countries.<br><br>
The only major exception is Holland where they decided in the mid-1970s to go in for shorter sentencing. The position there has been very remarkably different from here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's premise is absolutely right. We are facing not a national problem but a worldwide problem, but that does not exonerate us from making every attempt to solve it, every attempt to meet it and every attempt to deal with it in a civilised and merciful way. The hon. Gentleman made the point about short sentences in Holland, but surely one of the great merits of the detention centre is that sentences are short. It is designed not to put young people away for a long period in what have sometimes been called schools for crime, but to teach them a sharp lesson quickly. To my mind that is its great merit. We would be failing in our duty, in the light of the statistics I have quoted, if we took out of the series of means which the court has of dealing with this problem, this particular means which is being greatly improved by the Bill.<br><br>
When the use of detention centres first came in, the sentence was for three or six months. All too frequently the courts abused that use by passing six month sentences in cases where they ought to have given borstal training. The Bill provides for very short detention sentences. They may fail—in many cases I daresay they will—But we are dealing with human nature, and I am not saying human nature is not reformable—of course it is. One could not be a Christian if one believed that there was any person incapable of reform, but we must acknowledge that in many cases society's attempts seem to fail. We shall continue to have a failure rate, but because of a failure rate one does not abandon a means of protecting society and of reforming the potential young criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Pitt <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the amendment. The hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) has failed to grasp one salient point. The present short, sharp, shock detention centre sentence is not effective. If there is a failure rate of 86 per cent., surely it is time to review why this is being continued. A failure rate of 86 per cent, presupposes that there is only a success rate of 14 per cent, which strikes me as not much of a success.<br><br>
On Second Reading, I suggested that we should look not just at putting people into prison or into youth custody but at how we could creatively rehabilitate people in youth custody. If we are moving towards lesser custodial sentences, which is what I believe to be the spirit of the Bill, and towards greater rehabilitation, it seems perfectly illogical to keep the detention centre treatment in this Bill. It is illogical because the detention centre is clearly ineffective. It should be

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
removed and replaced—as it will be if the amendment —is carried—by a youth custody sentence. As a result these young people can be rehabilitated and brought back as more useful members of society, rather than come back after a detention centre, short, sharp, shock be equally useless to society and be an equal menace. That is what is happening now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I have been listening with interest to what Opposition Members have been saying.<br><br>
Clearly, the detention centres as they have been set up hitherto have not been an overwhelming success. While I am not certain that the hon. Lady's figure of 86 per cent, in entirely accurate.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is 76 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—I think that 76 per cent, is nearer to the figure—undoubtedly there is an unsatisfactory failure rate in the detention centre. That is one of the purposes of Government's alteration, to make the detention centre a shorter and sharper shock than it has been for the past 15 or 20 years.<br><br>
I would go further than the Government. The Minister said that one of the problems is that we do not catch the offenders young enough.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) stated that 1,500 violent offences and 11,500 burglaries are committed by those under 14. Those are very frightening figures, as are the figures for mugging. When we see in the newspapers the appalling things that are done to old and helpless people by children of 10, 11 and 12, there is something not only seriously wrong with our penal system but seriously wrong with our society. We cannot consider too much what should be done about school discipline and encouragement in the home for a proper way of life and Christian thought, but we can do something to rectify the shortcomings of the penal system.<br><br>
My submission is quite simple. Young offenders ought to be sent to detention centres when they are younger. If we are giving short, sharp, shocks, we want to catch the offenders in time before they are hardened by their own experience and by what those older than themselves have taught them. Therefore, I should like to see the age limit for a detention centre reduced to 12 from 15, because I think that at that age it is very much easier to reform children—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Five.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to make light of this, but if children of 11 and 12 mug old ladies, I do not believe that they are incapable of understanding what they are doing. There was an horrific picture in one of the newspapers last week of a man of 82 who had been severely beaten up, his face had been slashed and he was in an undescribable mess.<br><br>
It is nonsense for the hon. Gentleman to take a light-hearted approach and say that as they were only little children we should rehabilitate them.<br><br>
It is up to this House and up to those who have the responsibility for running the country to defend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
old and helpless. There was another account in a newspaper last week of a child who had had petrol spat in his face and a lighted match thrown at him by children under 14.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. It is the responsibility of this House to protect the public, Opposition Members meet that responsibility just as much as Conservative Members. But the point is surely the way in which that can best be done. We all want to protect the public from violent crime. We all want to ensure that offenders do not commit further offences. The evidence is that 76 per cent, of juveniles committed to detention centres commit further offences. That does not meet my objective or that of the hon. Gentleman. The evidence is also that non-custodial alternatives provide a greater measure of success. Surely we both want to prevent offending and to make young people more constructive and law-abiding members of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. I am glad to hear that that is the hon. Gentleman's objective. I am sure that that is so, and is true of his hon. Friends however lightly they may take some of the points that are seriously put. However, I do not accept that non-custodial sentences show a much higher rate of success. I simply do not believe that. Non-custodial sentences are given at the moment to people who have offended less. That is why fewer of those will re-offend. That is a matter of sheer common sense and the hon. Gentleman's argument is not sound.<br><br>
When it comes to the treatment given at the detention centre, I again do not go wholly along with my hon. and learned Friend and the Government or with the courts. I believe that I am right in saying that some years ago, when I used to practise at the Bar, it was not possible to send a child back to a detention centre for a second term. I may not be right about that, but that is my recollection. Certainly, it was not the practice of the magistrates to do so. If one is giving a short, sharp, shock, and the idea is that the person who is getting it should not wish to repeat it, it is clearly essential that the law should allow for it to be repeated.<br><br>
I suggest that some means should be found whereby it would be possible to send a child to a detention centre for a very short period first and then a slightly longer period.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
If a child were sent for one month, or even two weeks, for the first period so that he could get an idea of how unpleasant it would be, and then, if he did it again, for the full three or four month period, it would be a much more effective deterrent than the existing system. I ask my hon. and learned Friend to consider whether any changes could be made along those lines.<br><br>
I do not believe that enough emphasis is put on education in the detention centres. If the offender is there for three months or, as I should like, four months, there is a good opportunity to set about some of the more obvious shortcomings of the educational standards of the offenders. I should be interested to hear the figures on how many offenders sent to detention
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
centres are able to read and write, because I suspect that quite a lot of them cannot. There would be a good opportunity for some early remedial treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While one accepts the point that the hon. Gentleman has made, my experience of detention centres is that those of school age do have classes for part of the day. I do not understand why that cannot be provided in youth custody centres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it can be provided in youth custody, but what cannot is the short, sharp, shock. I am not suggesting that one should be substituted for the other but that both should go together. It is also important that in the detention centres the age group is reduced so that we have children meeting children, not children being led astray by older youths.<br><br>
If the Opposition put the whole thing under one umbrella, as they wish to do, the children would either be segregated—effectively that is what I am requesting, so that there are two separate places of training—or they would all be put together. I do not think there is anything to be gained from that.<br><br>
I do not mind if it is called youth custody supervision, so long as the premises and special premises are available to give the short, sharp, shock and to have what is essentially detention centre treatment.<br><br>
The Bill as it stands is correct in maintaining a detention centre system, but I should like to see the various changes that I have suggested made in the system as it is put into practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in some difficulty. I think that I have been left behind by the tide of advance of opinion, both reformist and reactionary, in the 1970s. The original starting point was the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, which sought to ensure that we always treated young people who were in difficulty criminally as if they were capable of being reformed. It was designed to look at their total problem rather than trying to pass a finite sentence on them which would be a punishment for what they had done, in the expectation that in that way we would help them to overcome their problems.<br><br>
The Children and Young Persons Act 1969 has never been given an opportunity to work properly because no Government have willed the resources that would enable it to take place. I take full responsibility as a Minister at the Home Office in the Labour Government for part of that neglect, but it is wrong to assume that because it was never tried it was a failure. Both Governments have now accepted that the attempt was a failure. The Labour Government in its Green Paper, and this Government in the Bill, have gone for a system of youth custody. The difference is that this Government are going for a period of finite sentencing in youth custody whereas the previous Government were going for a generic sentence of youth custody. In those circumstances the real issue is what should we do about detention centres.<br><br>
I think my hon. Friend, in moving the amendment, overlooked the fact that when going for a period of finite sentencing of youth custody, the idea that impelled the Labour Government in its Green Paper to abolish detention centres, is avoided because one does not impose upon all young people a system of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
generic sentence of youth custody which would be infinite. One imposes upon them a finite sentence that may be as little as three weeks. In those circumstances, the difference between a detention centre and, say, a three-week sentence, is simply the question of where one will spend it and what one will do when one spends it there.<br><br>
Conservative Members are much taken by the concept of short, sharp, shock. Nobody has yet proved that short, sharp, shock actually helps anybody. There are a lot of subjective assessments of individual cases that say that because a man went to prison for a short period—or because a youth went to detention centre for a short period—and never got into trouble again, that was successful. Equally, there is a wealth of evidence to show that it was unsuccessful in a lot of other cases and that the majority were unsuccessful. We must recognise—and I think increasingly criminologists are beginning to do so— that there is no such thing as a sentence which is either a deterrent or reformative. It is not by the penal system that we will change people's attitudes. We may change some. There are the individual cases. We have celebrated cases of murderers who have been to prison and taken their Open University degrees and came out and were resplendent citizens. By and large they are unusual. The pattern of criminality is that on the whole the changes take place for reasons that have nothing to do with the kind of sentence served. People grow older, marry, change their attitude to society for other reasons than the fact that they have been in a penal establishment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He said no sentence is a deterrent. Surely, sentences are deterrent in two ways; first, the fear of prison or detention centre or of any other punishment will surely, as human nature tells us, deter a great many people from committing crimes. Secondly, in some cases if not all, will it not deter by its imposition because the person sentenced is likely to say to himself "I am not going through that again"? Is that not the merit of what we call loosely the short, sharp, shock?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of studies have tried to determine whether there is such a thing as a deterrent sentence. I am sure the hon. and learned Gentleman, with his experience of Recorder at Birmingham, would be interested in the investigation into a sentence of 18 years upon a youth who was convicted of a serious assault when he was about 17, which had nationwide publicity. As a result of that, the Home Office decided to investigate the incidence of that kind of assult in Birmingham in the weeks that succeeded that sentence. It was found that there was no diminution at all in the incidence of that kind of assault. A succession of studies have proved that just because a Crown court or a High Court Judge issues what he calls a deterrent sentence, it does not mean that it has any marked effect upon the incidence of crime in the area.<br><br>
The only well publicised case was the Notting Hill trial some years ago, where for a period it had some effect upon the incidence of that kind of crime. That is a very rare occurrence.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
The fact is that we do not effect criminality and the incidence of crime by the length or kind of sentence. What we do is effect the kind and incidence of crime by the pattern of society and also by the measures we take in order to arrest and convict the offender.<br><br>
There is far more evidence to show that we actually affect the rate of crime by the way in which we investigate and fine the offender than any sentence that is passed upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's last point, of course it is important that the offenders should feel that he will be caught. If the offender feels that he will not be caught, he will act with much greater impugnity—that is quite clear.<br><br>
Earlier the hon. Gentleman appeared to say that the greatest reformatory element in any criminal's life is the fact that he settles down and changes his whole mode of approach. I would entirely accept that, but if that is so, is it not right that the important part of any sentence is, first, deterrence and, secondly, punishment, because the reformatory element that the hon. Gentleman talked about at length and said is not effective, will not therefore be the most effective part of the sentence?<br><br>
He said that deterrence does not exist in any form, which I believe to be flying in the face of human nature, because there are many things that we might like to do and the fear of hurting ourselves or of something unpleasant happening to us is what deters us from doing it.<br><br>
Exactly the same applies, particularly to younger people who are not hardened criminals. If they think that something really unpleasant will happen to them if they do something untoward, whether or not it is criminal, they will not do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whenever one argues this case with people who are convinced that human nature dictates their particular philosophy, one argues in a cauldron. I put the argument only to indicate that in my view there is no great virtue in determining the short sentence of youth custody and the sentence of a detention centre. The only issue is what kind of regime rules in the institution where the child is sent.<br><br>
If we were to do what my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax wants and abolish the detention centre, presumably those institutions that are presently detention centres would continue to be used for some kind of youth custody. We should not, therefore, have escaped the difficulty. We should have only indicated that it would be a different type of regime.<br><br>
The campaign to get rid of the detention centre has arisen largely because of the over-use of detention centre orders by the magistrates for children under 17 because the magistrates increasingly felt they had no other way of providing a finite sentence. The only alternative for them was a care order, and it was increasingly felt that the care order was out of their control and in the control of the social worker.<br><br>
By changing to finite youth custody, magistrates have an alternative, and it is most unlikely that in future they will use the detention centre anything like as much, because if the Bill is allowed to go through in its present form, the magistrates will have the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
capacity to send children between the ages of 15 and 17 to youth custody for finite terms that may exceed the period in a detention centre.<br><br>
Though the philosophy of the Green Paper of abolishing the detention centre may have been right, because youth custody in that sense was not finite sentence, where a finite sentence is being applied it probably is inconsequential.<br><br>
I am willing to vote with my hon. Friend the Minister for Halifax on the basis that I should have preferred us to have done nothing at all, but to have left the Children and Young Persons Act in operation until we obtained the resources to make it work properly. I shall go along with my hon. Friend's view which is based upon the Green Paper, but the reality is that we cannot do much at all whichever course we take.<br><br>
What will change, if anything —and I have already indicated my scepticism—is what is done inside the penal establishment when the children are there.<br><br>
The Government are much taken with short, sharp, shocks and the detention centres where these were supposed to be imposed were at Send and New Hall. Some of us have been to Send and New Hall. When I visited New Hall I was told that the young people there enjoyed the regime far more than the old detention centre, because in the old detention centre they had to do some more work which they did not like, whereas they liked the physical exercise.<br><br>
The idea that they were operating some kind of awful deterrent sentence was nonsense. I wish that Conservative Members would recognise that in this argument about law and order there really is no particular party division. We all want to see a reduction in the incidence of crime. The real essence is to try to evaluate what effect is made upon the incidence of crime by sentencing of one kind or another or by the rate at which one is able to arrest the criminal, thereby deterring criminals from going into crime at all.<br><br>
I put my money on the second, because all the evidence suggests that is where the greatest impact can be made. I do not put my money on the first because, as I indicated in my reply to the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor), the Dutch experiment manifestly shows that cutting sentencing does not have any adverse effect at all upon the incidence of crime. It may not actually cut the rate of crime, but it does not increase it. Therefore, it is wrong to assume that you can deal with criminality in this country or anywhere else by simply imposing heavier fines or more deterrent sentences of one kind or another.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
For that reason I suspect that the initiative of going for youth custody of one kind or another will to be seen to be nonsense by the mid 1980s, just as much of what we have done before has been seen to be nonsense because the answer is not in sentencing. It is not penal policy at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend for York (Mr. Lyon) will forgive me if I do not follow him into the important philosophical part of his speech—the efficacy of the deterrent principle and matters of that kind. I shall confine myself simply to the narrow point at issue, which is whether we ought to preserve the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
detention centre within the terms in which it is constrained by the Bill when we are making a radical alteration in the method of dealing with the young offender.<br><br>
In an intervention by my hon. Friend for Blyth (Mr. Ryman) in the speech of my hon. Friend for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), he queried her view about the opinion of magistrates in particular. It seems to me that we are dealing with a totally different situation from the one that exists at the moment. If a custodial sentence is to be passed at all, other than for the gravest possible crime when prison may be inevitable, the alternative is either borstal or detention centre.<br><br>
The Bill, quite rightly in my view, abolishes borstal. There may be different views on whether it is right wholly to abolish the indeterminate aspect of borstal, but I do not want to go into that at the moment. At present, if a magistrate thinks that custodial sentence is apposite, he only has the choice between an indeterminate sentence of up to two years in borstal, with all the criticisms that entails, and a detention centre sentence, that dilemma will no longer arise.<br><br>
The real question, therefore, is whether, in the new context of the youth custody order taking the place of a borstal order, it is necessary and right to retain the specific, different sentence of a detention centre order.<br><br>
In dealing with that, of course, one must look at what the Bill provides and the terms within which the order can be made. It must not be more than four months for the shorter sentences. I think I am right in saying that for the first time in law, this is confined to those who have not served a sentence of imprisonment, borstal training or youth custody. One is limiting the type of person.<br><br>
I and others have asked the Home Secretary what sort of person the short, sharp, shock sentence is intended for. The answer invariably is that that is a matter for the courts to decide. Now at least the courts are to be given some guidance. It is apparently not to be for those who have already served a term of imprisonment, borstal and so on. Therefore, broadly speaking it is to be for persons who have not been in custody before.<br><br>
We have a short term for those who have not been in custody before, and it is within those parameters that we must look at the question of whether this sentence should be retained. I think it right to say a word about the history of detention centres. They were first introduced as a means of providing a short, sharp shock, but that concept fell into disfavour because over the years it was not successful. The consequence was that the regime in detention centres became more and more of an educative and reforming character and less and less the original idea of a short, sharp, shock.<br><br>
Now we have come back full circle to the short, sharp, shock. I cannot help feeling that this sentence is being retained in the Bill not because anybody is convinced of its inherent merits as a sentence, but because a liberal Home Secretary, who would probably very much prefer to get rid of it altogether, has to face a difficult audience every October. Last October was perhaps more difficult than ever before. It is very difficult to be liberal in certain circumstances at the seaside. In order to placate those who habitually
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
attend that particular jamboree and their fellows within the party, he retains the detention centre concept and seeks to return to the original idea of a short, sharp, shock.<br><br>
In dealing with adult offenders we give the courts certain powers to impose some form of non-custodial treatment, or if they feel that they must impose a custodial penalty, to send the offender to prison. Within that prison regime all kinds of treatment are determined by the prison authorities as best to suit the offender having regard to his character, his previous convictions and all the other factors that are known about him.<br><br>
Indeed, he can move around from one prison to another, from a closed to an open prison, from a prison with more training facilities to one with less according to the way he reacts to the circumstances of prison.<br><br>
If that has been accepted as the basic principle for the adult offender, why, when we are dealing with a complete and radical transformation of the regime for the young offender, is it inappropriate to deal with the young offender in the same way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentlemen has surely not made a good point. The adult offenders are moved about after substantial periods of time, and the detention centre sentence, as I understand it, will not last longer than four months. One cannot effectively move people about within that time scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Moving about may take place at any time. Certainly, in many cases it takes place after a substantial period, but determination of what sort of prison the offender originally goes to after his period of allocation is a matter for the authorities. That can be a quite short period. He can be sent straightaway, for example, to an open prison rather than a closed one, or to a maximum security prison, or to a maximum security wing within a prison.<br><br>
I hope to see a development of the custodial system as a whole, both the prison system and the youth system, into one where there is a wide variety within the same complex of buildings so that prisoners can go from an area of the prison where their liberty is vigorously constrained to one where the walls are down, and so on. That should be our way of developing the prison system.<br><br>
I do not see why there should be something totally different for the young person. The result is that the decision on what kind of regime that young person is to suffer is made not by those who have the opportunity of judging him as a person in the context of custody but by those who deal with him at the moment of conviction or sentence. Often, the decision is made in terms of the emotion of the moment. It may have regard to the type of offence that he has committed and whether the offence has attracted a great deal of publicity, rather than to the needs of the particular offender himself.<br><br>
The Government are trying to reduce that by the provisions of clause 2(5), but at the end of the day it will be for the courts to decide on the type of regime. Even there we are left somewhat in the dark as to whether in the future we shall have two different types of detention centre regime, one the short,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
sharp, shock, regime and the other the type of detention centre that has grown up as a reaction from the short, sharp, shock, complex.<br><br>
I do not know whether that will be the future system or whether all detention centres will go over to the short, sharp, shock, but certainly nobody has been able to answer the question that I have repeatedly asked. How does one really decide, at the moment of sentencing someone, whether the short, sharp, shock will be the best way of preventing him from offending in the future, or whether it should be something more on reformative or educational lines? We are increasingly recognising that for some adult offenders a short period in custody—and nothing more—is all that is required to show them that society really does mean to deal with people who offend against its laws. Why should that not be sufficient in the case of the young person as it is intended to be in the case of the adult offender?<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The constraints that the Government are putting into the Bill appear to suggsest that one does not put a hardened offender into a detention centre. I do not envy the courts in the future any more than in the past in the decision that they will have to make between youth custody and detention centre.<br><br>
I know the Minister will talk about giving the courts flexibility. Of course, they could be given flexibility in respect of adults, but nobody has suggested that they should be given it in this way. It is sufficiently flexible to give the Courts a range of punishment, including the punishment of custody as a last resort, and for those in charge of the youth system to decide what kind of regime is suitable for the particular offender once he has been sentenced to custody, however short the sentence may be. For those reasons, I am totally unconvinced that the basis for retaining the detention centre is other than to placate those who besiege the Home Secretary in a way which seeks to drive him off the liberal stance that I think he wants to assume, but from which, unhappily, has allowed himself to be driven away. There is no logical basis other than that for this decision to retain the detention centre as a separate establishment within the youth custody system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures given by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) this morning were staggering and serious. There is no doubt that crimes of violence committed by the young are increasing year by year. This is a serious problem for society and one that I believe society must face very squarely.<br><br>
I do not believe that all the answers lie in detention centres and many of the other things about which we have talked this morning. There is a deep responsibility on the parent. There is also a deep responsibility on the teacher.<br><br>
Over the last 20 to 25 years this problem has slowly continued. Crimes of violence and lack of discipline, I believe, have as much been caused by the lack of discipline at home and in the school. If, in fact, there is no discipline in the home or at school, it must be understood that young people may well start to go astray. One can take a simple analysis. If one buys a small puppy dog and does not start to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
train it, correctly, sometimes with some discipline, one will soon have an unruly animal. I am afraid that is absolutely true with young children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Treat them just like dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that they are like dogs, I am giving a clear example. Without the right discipline and guidance the problems will grow as time goes on. That is exactly what we have seen in society for a long time. The problems have grown steadily with lack of parental control and discipline both in the home and in schools.<br><br>
They are facts, figures are undeniable, because on the figures given to us this morning we can see that increases have taken place. There is no denying that discipline both in the home and in the schools has gone down over the last 20 years. It is symptomatic of our society that during those years many children have come home from school to an empty house because both their parents are at work. Many of them have very little home life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's analysis of the causes of juvenile crime. Will he tell us which research studies have shown that a decrease in the incidence of parental and school disciplines has led to the increase in juvenile crime? I should be interested to have this information. Given that he has this information at his disposal, what does he propose should be done to restore discipline both in the school and in the home?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) gets tempted along that road, I ask him to relate his remarks to detention centre orders which is the subject of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bendall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just giving some background information to what I believe are the problems of juvenile delinquency and how it has come about. That being the case, I can see no alternative to a quick and stern shock treatment, otherwise the figures for extreme violence will climb higher.<br><br>
I was not at all surprised to learn that the figures for extreme violence were moving towards those of burglary in the various age groups, which is perhaps more staggering than anything else. I believe that a short, sharp, sentence in the detention centre will have an effect on young people.<br><br>
We have heard that 76 per cent, is an unsuccessful rate, but if the detention centre did not exist, I wonder how much higher the unsuccessful rate would be. There are no comparable figures in that respect, at least none has been quoted this morning.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) made certain comments about the October jamboree at Blackpool. I might be accused of veering from the subject, Mr. Dean, if I talked about the jamboree at the last Labour Party conference. The right hon. and learned Member really may think that just a few people at Conservative Party conference are concerned about law and order generally, and youth crime and violence in particular, but if he examines many of the opinion polls published by national newspapers on this and other subjects
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
concerning crime in the last few years, he will see that many people want us to take stern measures against crimes of violence.<br><br>
I therefore believe it right that we should have the short, sharp, shock, treatment. I do not believe that there has been time to judge its success. But when my constituents complain that their children, under local authority care orders, are allowed to stay out until one and two o'clock in the morning, I am convinced that something is drastically wrong with our system and that something must be done to put it right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) would not only end the separate detention centre sentence but reduce the minimum youth custody sentence to 21 days from the four months as provided in the Bill.<br><br>
As it stands, the Bill would amalgamate the separate sentences of imprisonment and borstal training into a single determinate youth custody sentence, the length of which would be determined by the courts in each individual case. It is important to say at the outset, that that change proposed by the Government is a major step forward and the Government are to be commended and congratulated for having taken it.<br><br>
The Government's White Paper " Young Offenders ", published in 1980, on which Part I of the Bill is based, was entirely correct, in my view, in its argument that except in the special circumstances of a life sentence, for example, all custodial sentences should be determined.<br><br>
Paragraph 11 of the White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"… so that the courts can mark the seriousness of the offence by the length of the sentence they impose"</p></blockquote>
The fact that the Bill introduces determinacy into all custodial sentences for young people should, I believe, be welcome not only as a matter of principle but because of the unfairness of the indeterminate borstal sentence in practice.<br><br>
Indeed, as the prison borstal governors branch of the Society of Civil and Public Servants, in its comments on the Green Paper " Youth Custody and Supervision: A New Sentence ", which was published, as my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyson) pointed out, by the last Government in 1978, stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The arbitrariness of the system from the trainee's perspective is clearly exemplified by the different target dates operative in different institutions. Time spent in custody can thus be dependent on the vagaries of the allocation procedure rather than upon any individual effort."</p></blockquote>
At this early stage in our proceedings, I want to place on record that it is my view that the ending of indeterminate borstal sentence is a laudible and commendable report. It is a milestone in the movement toward the greater measure of justice in sentencing.<br><br>
Having said that, I also agree with the principle embodied in the amendments, namely, that it would be desirable to go further and to amalgamate all three custodial sentences for young offenders into one youth custody system. However, I must enter an important caveat which is an important note of reservation.<br><br>
It would be perfectly possible to abolish the separate detention centre sentence and rename detention centres " short term youth custody centres ",
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
yet to continue in practice—this point has been made by several of my hon. Friends—operating them much as before; in the same buildings, with the same staff, the same facilities and the same regime.<br><br>
We should not, therefore, delude ourselves that merely calling detention centres by another name will in itself make the slightest difference to the treatment of young offenders. Unless and until that change in name is accompanied by real changes of substance in the treatment of young people serving short custodial sentences, then the amendment, laudible though it may be, will be nothing but a pointless cosmetic exercise.<br><br>
My concern is to ensure that the new radicalism that I see on the Labour Front Bench will not only be translated into Government after the next general election but will be seen to be not just cosmetic but realistic in wanting sustantial and effective change in treatment, not merely changes of a sentence and of the name of the institution.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I still support the amendment because amalgamating all three types of custodial establishments into one youth custody system would provide a framework which, potentially, could be used to improve the treatment which young people actually receive in custody.<br><br>
I state that for three main reasons. First, it could be used potentially to improve treatment because one of the problems of maintaining the three separate custodial systems for young offenders is the fact that it is difficult to relieve overcrowding in one part of the system by using vacancies that happen at that time to exist in another part. If we merged two of these sentences into one, as the Bill provides, this would provide, as I am sure the Government are well aware— it is part of their intention—greater flexibility for the prison department in trying to minimise the effects of overcrowding.<br><br>
If we went further, as my hon. Friend proposes, and as the amendment would implement, and incorporate the detention centre into the same youth custody system, the potential flexibility would be even greater. I think that this added flexibility that would be given is an important consideration for a hard-pressed custodial system which encounters considerable strain at the moment, particuarly at certain times of the year.<br><br>
The second reason for which I believe the change in the system could be potentially beneficial is that the principle of merging borstals and young prisoners' sentences into one youth custody system should make it possible to allocate more offenders to places near their homes and therefore make it easier for relatives, friends, probation officers and social workers to visit them. Incorporating the detention centre into the system in addition would increase the scope for this still further. It is impossible to over-stress the importance of the resettlement of young people who have been in trouble. They have enormous difficulties which usually in one way or another have led to their criminality and to their being committed to a penal establishment.<br><br>
12.15 pm.<br><br>
The fact of their incarceration usually exacerbates not lessens the problems they have in the community.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Their rehabilitation back with their families, their friends, their jobs, whatever it may be, is made more difficult, not easier, by the fact that they have served a custodial sentence, and anything which minimises the damage of the institution, which helps to keep the close contact between a family and an offender is to be encouraged and welcomed. I think that that objective would be better served by extending the youth custody system as, indeed, is in effect proposed by these amendments.<br><br>
Although the prison and probation staff make great efforts to ensure that there is good liaison between penal establishments and probation officers in offenders' home areas, the longer distances involved severely restrict opportunities for probation officers to visit and get to know the offender in advance of his release.<br><br>
Indeed, as the Advisory Council on the Penal System said in its report on young offenders in 1974;
<br><blockquote><p>"It should be an object of policy so to reorganise the pattern of location of establishments and the allocation of young adult offenders to them that periods in custody will normally be spent in establishments situated nearer to their home areas."</p></blockquote>
The strain on the family of a young person who is detained in a penal establishment is serious enough without adding the additional burden and extra strain of enjoining them to make long, expensive, arduous, and very tiring journeys to visit their relatives when these would be totally unnecessary if only we had a much more sensible, flexible and imaginative use of the custodial establishments that are actually available to us.<br><br>
Nothing, however, would be gained if we merely changed the name of the detention centre sentence to short-term youth custody but continued basing the allocation of young offenders to different establishments primarily on the length of sentence rather than on nearness to home. I accept, and it is something we have debated on other occasions in different venues, that there is a conflict between the desirability oj placing young offenders in establishments near their homes as against the possible advantages of placing them in a youth custody centre with a regime that is actually geared to their particular problems.<br><br>
However, maintaining the links between an offender and his home area, and especially his family, is of such major and paramount importance that that should be the most important consideration in the criteria for determining the allocation of an offender, not the type of regime that may be suitable to him. There is argument about which is more important. It is a matter of judgment. I state my judgment quite clearly, and I believe that it would be the judgment of most sensible people that it is far more important to gear the offender's allocation to his home base rather than to his needs in terms of the regime supposed to be in existence at that particular establishment.<br><br>
My third reason for believing that this amendment can be potentially useful in improving treatment for young offenders is that it would attempt to end the separate detention centre sentence which would help to avoid what I consider an appalling injustice, carried out at the moment to mentally unfit young people, and which is likely to be made worse as a result of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
At present the Bill provides that a young person on whom the court wants to pass a short custodial sentence, but who happens to be physically or mentally unfit for a detention centre, will be given a short youth custody sentence. In explaining this the White Paper " Young Offenders " said:
<br><blockquote><p>"These young adults will be sentenced to youth custody but placed as appropriate by the prison department."</p></blockquote>
That seemed to overcome our worries and our reservations about imposing a custodial sentence— a severe detention sentence—on those who are mentally or physically disabled. The prison department would allocate them as appropriate. The problem is that the next sentence of the White Paper went on to define " as appropriate " as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"They are most likely to serve their sentences in accommodation in adult prisons in much the same way as young adults who are currently sentenced to up to six months in prison."</p></blockquote>
That I believe is a serious scandal. It means that those young people whose mental state demands that they should receive the best possible care will be dumped in adult prisons where the facilities and the opportunities for constructive and mentally-stimulating activity are the worst, and where the most appalling conditions in the whole of the prison system exist. I believe it to be an extreme abuse of words for the White Paper to have described serving a sentence in such conditions as " appropriate " for such offenders who are mentally or physically disabled. It is grossly inappropriate.<br><br>
No doubt it will be the Minister's defence that it is administratively convenient, but it is also barbaric. I hope that other Members will take the same view and impress on the Government the inappropriateness and the barbarity of putting young people who happen, through no fault of their own, to have a physical or mental disability, into some of the most horrendous conditions that exist within the whole of the penal estate.<br><br>
If this amendment were to be carried, though I do not know whether my hon. Friend is inclined—given what my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) has said—to push this to a vote, there would be no separate detention sentences and all young offenders sentenced to custody would receive youth custody sentences. If that were the case there would be no reason why such people could not be placed in a youth custody centre rather than in an adult prison. Frankly, even if the separate detention centre system is retained, it surely cannot be beyond the wit of the Minister or the enormous expertise that exists at the Home Office to devise another means of accommodating these particular mentally unfit people in more humane and civilised accommodation. Even if he resists this particular series of amendments, I hope that the Minister will give a clear, unequivocal and specific assurance that he will look again at the plight of these particular people.<br><br>
The only real argument in favour of retaining the separate detention centres is that the detention centre regime is so distinctive that it makes sense to bring detention centres into the same system as youth custody centres. It is worth recording that in 1970 the Advisory Council on the Penal System in its report " Detention Centres " recommended that:
<br><blockquote><p>"the punitive function of detention in a detention centre should be regarded as fulfilled by the deprivation of an offender's liberty."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
From that premise it went on to recommend that positive training, particularly of an educational nature, should be formally incorporated in the approach of detention centres.<br><br>
It is also worth recalling that those recommendations were accepted in principle by the incoming Conservative Government, whose Minister of State, then at the Home Office, the right hon. and learned Member for Runcorn (Mr. Carlisle) had been a member of the subcommittee of the Advisory Council on the Penal System which produced that report. It is a great pity that the right hon. and learned Member for Runcorn, who seems to have such civilised and sensible views, is now neither in the Government nor is Home Secretary. Were he to be so, we might have had a more humane and effective law and order and penal policy.<br><br>
That not being the case, I share the view with the Advisory Council, with the Conservative Government of the time and with the right hon. and learned Member for Runcorn, that detention centre regimes should be as constructive as is compatible with the limitations of a short period in custody. I cannot, therefore, see any reason why detention centres should not be merged into a single youth custody system with a consistent and constructive training philosophy.<br><br>
Indeed, the only reason that the Minister can resist this suggestion is precisely the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin). The only reason for the Government's insistence on retaining the detention centres is the public relations reason, not merely for the public as a whole but in particular for its own members and Back Benchers. They can pretend cosmetically that they are actually doing something strong and effective, and trying to combat the increasing incidence of criminality amongst young people, while maintaining four experimental short, sharp, shock regimes at the four detention centres.<br><br>
For that reason I think that the Government will find it extremely difficult to accept this series of amendments, particularly as they seem committed to pursuing their retrograde short, sharp, shock experiment on the basis of the tougher regimes now operating at the four detention centres. It is fair to acknowledge that the Government stress that the regimes are experimental, but it is also acknowledged that there are currently no research findings which suggest that tougher regimes will produce lower re-conviction rates than more constructive regimes.<br><br>
As the Minister of State well knows, research studies throughout the prison, borstal, detention centre and community home system, both in this country and throughout the Western world, have found little difference in re-conviction rates as a result of different types of custodial regime. Anyone who is at all familiar with this exhaustive body of research knows perfectly well that the Government's short, sharp, shock regime will prove no more beneficial in reducing crime than the more constructive approaches favoured by the Advisory Council on the Penal System and indeed, let it be said, the previous Conservative Government. It is this chimera of a regime which can supposedly shock young people out of their delinquency which is the main obstacle to the Government accepting a combining of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
three custodial sentences for young people in one youth custody sentence.<br><br>
I support my hon. Friend's amendment, but I must repeat that merely to rename the detention centres " short term youth custody centres " would be a complete non-event unless the new youth custody system, combining the three different types of establishment, were operated not by this Government but by a Government determined to take full advantage of the flexibility which this system would offer.<br><br>
The Government should accept the evidence presented by the Home Office that many of the young offenders who are currently sentenced to detention centres have serious problems of lack of social skills, educational attainments, inadequate home background and job opportunities. Those problems must be solved, and those difficulties must be resolved, if those young offenders are to be returned to the community as constructive, contributing and law-abiding members of society.<br><br>
This is what I and my hon. Friends want, but it will not be served by the current barbaric and negative practice of subjecting such young offenders to the mindless operation of drill, parades and inspections, which does not lung to deal with their problems or to lower the re-conviction rates.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Clearly, their problems will be dealt with only by an approach which puts the emphasis on education, acquiring skills and training. That should be the basis of any acceptance on the part of the Ministers of the amendments moved by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Bill there are matters that should not be cause for party division. One hopes the two main parties will operate a relaxed whipping system on the Bill to enable hon. Members to vote as they think right. I am sad that two Conservative Members who are most concerned with prison reform—the hon. Members for Cheltenham (Mr. Irving) and Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes) are not on the Committee. One sees that the Right Wing of the Conservative Party is heavily represented, no doubt at the selection of the Government. Nonetheless, this should not be a party Bill. Each new clause should be looked at strictly on its merits, and I hope that hon. Members will have the courage to do that.<br><br>
We should bear in mind that nowadays the main powerhouse of reform is the fact that the prison system at all levels is chock-a-block. It is that which sometimes makes the Home Office lend a respective ear to arguments for reformers who might otherwise suffer a polite rejection.<br><br>
The detention centre has attracted so much attention recently because of the short, sharp, shock regime. The short, sharp, shock regime, in my view, was introduced by a timorous Conservative Government, forced to cut sentences for young people because of shortage of space in institutions, wishing to make it passable to its supporters.<br><br>
Therefore, the concept of the short, sharp, shock was introduced to cover a reduction in the periods spent in a detention centre. What people tend to forget is that the short, sharp, shock, which in my view
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
is not helpful as a method of treatment—in fact it is not a method of treatment—has been introduced to cover the forced contraction of periods spent in custody for young people based on shortage of spaces. It succeeded to such a degree that under the cover of that doctrine the Government have been able to move to a shorter period of sentence for young people.<br><br>
One must bear in mind that the short, sharp, shock, while it cuts down the period spent in a detention centre, does nothing very much towards rehabilitating the persons incarcerated in a detention centre.<br><br>
The question therefore is why the Government should wish to persist with it now they have produced a new Bill. There are two arguments about the effect of the short, sharp, shock. One is that it increases the number of persons sent to detention centres because the magistrates think it is short and, therefore, might do some good. The other argument, which I suspect was accepted by a desperate Government at the time, is that people sentenced to a detention centre could be released earlier. In this new system why should it not be called youth custody?<br><br>
I agree that the name itself generally makes no difference and that it is what happens inside the institution that matters. I feel that the Government's intention to retain the detention centre appellation is an indication that, perhaps through shortage of resources they are abandoning for youths under 17 years any attempt to have a constructive regime and that they will apply their efforts to those over 17 years by the new form of youth custody.<br><br>
One can sympathise with a Government in office hampered by an enormous shortage of resources. Nonetheless, one feels that this represents an almost permanent abandonment of young people to a health and exercise regime, which is not enough if one wishes to improve conduct once they have been released. For that reason, I should have preferred a change of name, not because it would make much differences now but because it might be a portent of the Government's intention in the medium term to do something about the way that young people are treated in institutions.<br><br>
I accept that magistrates, once the pyschological concept of the short, sharp, shock has been inculcated, may give youngsters shorter sentences. On the other hand, that is likely to be balanced, even after the Bill has been passed, by the number of magistrates who will send people to a detention centre who otherwise have kept them out of custody altogether.<br><br>
We have no figures yet of the effect of short, sharp, shock detention centre orders. We know that 76 per cent, of those who come out of the normal regime in detention centres have been convicted again. The figures are even worse for borstal offenders. The penologists are less sanguine than they were years ago about the possibilities of rehabilitating people who go to any kind of institution. If I thought that the effect of retaining detention centres with a short, sharp, shock simply meant that people would be released after six weeks or less, rather than having to stay four months or more, I would have to ask what was best.<br><br>
What would a person convicted think about the difference between a longer sentence and a shorter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
sentence, even one which was alleged to be less comfortable?<br><br>
My feeling is that we must sustain a line where we intend to take a positive attitude towards young people. Although I am not satisfied that the amendment will achieve much in actuality, in so far as it indicates that the Government should pursue a positive policy towards young people, designed to help them face the future and not simply have them running around like trainee soldiers or penal convicts 100 years ago. I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Concern about law and order is not the monopoly of any one political party. All of us share the concern about the increasing numbers of offenders. I understand that the Home Secretary was shattered by his experience in Blackpool last summer and on his return to the Home Office there were immediate discussions about the Bill now before us.<br><br>
I wonder whether the cause of penal reform, which many of us espouse, is helped or hindered by our attacking the Home Secretary on the issue of short, sharp shocks.<br><br>
I wonder, too, whether the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) who spoke in such detail about the benefits if the short, sharp, shock regime at detention centres, has actually been to a detention centre and seen such regimes at first hand.<br><br>
I had the advantage of visiting the Send detention centre before the short, sharp, shock regime was introduced and also shortly afterwards. On the second occasion, the Home Office sent a number of officials down there to make sure that the answers given by the staff at Send were in accordance with the professed policy of the Home Office.<br><br>
A number of significant myths are being perpetrated about the short, sharp, shock regime. The changes at Send since the new regime was introduced are rather small. On the whole, they are changes for the better. They should have been introduced anyway, whether or not there had been a Conservative Conference at which the "short, sharp, shock" phrase was bandied about for political advantage.<br><br>
At Send one element of the work has been done away with—an unfortunate type of work, breaking up old cassette tapes; a distractive form of work which the warden thought was a pretty deplorable type of activity anyway. That has been replaced by more productive work.<br><br>
Secondly, the youngsters at Send drill rather like the Army and, thirdly, the timetable has been tightened up so that they do not have too much time to breathe between one activity and another.<br><br>
If one believes that there is a benefit in custodial sentences for young people I do not think that there is much to complain about, and I certainly would not complain about the regime at Send, if one goes to the extent of locking up young people. But no positive service has been done to penal thinking by bandying about the expression " short, sharp shock " as if it were doing something significantly different from what detention centres were doing before."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Warren Hawksley <span class='memberconstituency'>(The Wrekin)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: With his experience of the new and the old regime can the hon. Gentleman say what the difference is for the people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
within it? Do they feel that they are enjoying it? Do they feel that it is tougher? Do they, as youngsters within the new tough sentencing regime, feel that they are better or worse for it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, or otherwise, the sentences at Send, which average six weeks, are such that on my second visit there was no one there who had been there under the old regime so there is no young person who can make that comparison.<br><br>
I asked the young people what they thought of the regime—was it tough and were they aware that they were the first group to undergo the short, sharp shock? They said that it was tough. I think that they felt that they had to say that in order to justify the speeches that the Home Secretary had been making. They are not total fools. They said it was tough, especially the physical education—possibly because when they went there they were not physically fit and found the first week or two of physical education a bit daunting. Nevertheless, I was told by the staff that there is a great deal of competition to get on to the physical education team.<br><br>
I do not think that the physical education programme was that harsh. The whole picture of Send, for better or worse, was very reminiscent of the days many years ago when I did my basic training as a national Serviceman in the Army.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
It may be that there could be more emphasis on education, though the staff at Send said that the young people were of average or slightly below average ability, but they were significantly below average in their educational achievement. There is some emphasis on education, but perhaps the balance should be changed, and there should be a greater emphasis on education. The danger of going too far down that path is that people will say, as staff in custodial establishments for young people say, that if they had young people for longer they could do more for them. There is, therefore, pressure to say that if there were longer sentences, these people could be helped more with education. That is a conclusion which many of us would have to reject entirely.<br><br>
The main comment that the young people at Send made was that they do not like being locked up. If there is any deterrent about Send, it is the dislike of being kept in custody. I do not think that the regime itself enters into it all that much. It is the sheer dislike of being away from home and being kept locked up 24 hours a day for, in the case of Send a six-week period. There was an element of levity in some of the remarks I made about Send, but I was trying to correct the misapprehension about the way in which detention centres operate.<br><br>
There is a sad pattern about those who go to detention centres. Many have been in trouble before. Many were in local authority care. Many were in children's homes and so on. Unfortunately, those experiences the young people at Send before they went into custody do not help us to predict more accurately what sort of young people are liable to get into trouble.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
I understand that the indicators common to young people at Send are also common to many others who do not get into trouble to the extent that they are sentenced to a detention centre. It is more difficult for us to draw any conclusions from the typical experiences of young people who go to detention centres when we consider remedial action within the community to prevent them getting into the sort of trouble that attracts a custodial sentence.<br><br>
That is one of the main dilemmas in trying to look at how we can deal with young offenders. By the time they are in custody, all our efforts have failed. By the tiem they are locked up, we have failed to take the sort of step that might have kept them out of trouble. I do not believe that there is just one type of young person classified as offender compared with the others who are non-offenders.<br><br>
There is a very thin line between young people who get into trouble, possibly the serious trouble that attracts a custodial sentence and those who manage, by and large, to avoid getting into trouble. It is an unfortunate truth that for every young person in Send there are four or five others who might, but for a series of lucky circumstances, also have been in trouble. One if the challenges to us is to try to devise measures in the community that steer the maximum number of young people through the difficult years in their teens without getting into custody because once in custody there is a danger that they tend to become not hardened criminals, but re-offenders.<br><br>
The challenge to us is not so much what we do to young people in detention centres or in other forms of youth custody, but whether society is taking the necessary steps, punitive and otherwise, to prevent young people from being locked up. All the evidence is that if we can prevent them getting into serious trouble by the time they reach early adulthood we will have prevented them becoming members of the criminal fraternity. Therefore, the challenge to us is much more what we do before anybody gets into a detention centre than what happens to him when he is there.<br><br>
There are advantages in short sentences and I welcome the general thrust of having shorter sentences in an institution, whether we call it a detention centre or not, and therefore I welcome the three-week sentence, although there is a danger which I want to mention. It is that if the sentence is short there may be a temptation for the courts to be keener to send young people to a detention centre on the ground that a sentence of three weeks is less severe than one of six weeks and, therefore, more people could be sent for the three-week sentence.<br><br>
It is important to build into the system adequate safeguards, as far as possible, to make it more difficult for the courts to send people to a detention centre, rather than easier, even if the sentence is shorter. Without such safeguards there is a danger that the measures suggested in the Bill will encourage the courts to send more people into custody.<br><br>
There is probably, on balance, merit in the amendment suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) to make away the classifications of detention centre from the other types and to have one youth custody sentence. Therefore, I shall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
support the amendment, although I think that the other points are probably of great significance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall not be thought to be discourteous if I reply to this interesting debate in a manner that may enable us to decide on the amendment before we rise. I start from the proposition that we all recognise that there is a proportion of young offenders for whom a custodial sentence is, in practical terms, inevitable. I do not think that anybody who has spoken in this debate disagrees with that. To take but one reason by that may be so, custody represents a measure of punishment which the public believe to be just and necessary in certain circumstances and we get into very difficult country if we lose the confidence of the public in the structure of our penal system.<br><br>
If one believes that custody is either unjust or unnecessary, that is the end of the argument on the amendment. If, on the contrary, one accepts my opening proposition that there is a place for custody and a place for custodial punishment, the question becomes what sort of custodial sentence should be available. Should it be a uniform sentence variable only in duration, whether by the courts or by the executive—a generic sentence—or should there be a choice to take account of the varied characteristics, whether the age of the young offender, the gravity of his offence or the type of regime that is suitable for his case?<br><br>
We reject the generic sentence in the White Paper and we set out our reasons in paragraph 14.1 will not weary the Committee by reading it but basically the argument is that the types of regime that are suitable for the short sentence are applied in the detention centre, the medium sentence as at borstal or the longer prison sentence, vary so greatly as not sensibly to be capable of being brought within a generic sentence. I very much welcome what has been said, not least by the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), by way of a welcome to the ending of the indeterminate borstal sentence and making determinate the custodial sentences of whatever variety that the courts shall have available for young offenders.<br><br>
Much has been said about what has been described as the short, sharp shock regimes at the experimental detention centres. I wish to say only that it will not be until early next year that we shall have the first figures of re-conviction rates after two years. As I have often said to the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), it is no good asking for preliminary figures of how it is going. We shall know nothing of any value until another year has elapsed.<br><br>
To those who say that it is much nicer and much jollier there now, I rely upon what was said by <i>The Guardian</i> reporter after the press day last year. He met a young man who had been at Send both before and after the new regime. The hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) visited Send both before and after. <i>The Guardian</i> reporter ended his piece:
<br><blockquote><p>"That young man said 'I have been here before and now I am here under the new regime. It is very much tougher and I don't want to come back'."</p></blockquote>
He does not want to come back; we do not want him to come back. That is what it is all about.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Detention centres are certainly a deterrent for some. The difficulty is that one cannot measure the extent of the deterrent. But I am certain that we should be thought by the public to be crazily irresponsible if we were to remove from our penal structure a means by which a court can give a short experience of detention. The Bill makes it much shorter, down to three weeks—two weeks with remission. It reduces the maximum from six months to four months. What is suggested is that we should get rid of that and make it part of the generic sentence.<br><br>
The essential point is that the courts should be able to say not only how long somebody will stay in, but whether he should go to a detention centre-type of regime .We do not believe that it would be right to go down the road of determinate sentences, as we are doing, and to remove from the structure the detention centre option. The courts have a difficult task. We are giving them a wider spectrum of non-custodial orders to choose from, but we insist that we should retain the detention centre, which is why I must advise my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman indicate his reactions to the points that I put to him about individuals who are considered to be mentally or physically disabled? He seems to be in a great hurry to finish by one o'clock. It is not necessary, we have plenty of time. It is an important issue. If it is not discussed today and he rushes the Committee forward to a vote which it is not necessary to have now, for the want of two or three more minutes next Tuesday, we will not have an opportunity to get an answer to these important questions.<br><br>
Therefore, I must press the hon. and learned Gentleman, however much of a hurry he appears to be in, to give us the assurance that he will look again at the position of those persons who are considered, by himself and the prison system, to be too physically or mentally disabled to be placed in a detention centre and who instead will be committed to adult prisons which have the worst conditions. Will he look again at the plight of those people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: am only too anxious to meet the wishes of the Committee. I will certainly look again at the mentally handicapped offenders to which the hon. Gentlemen referred. I cannot give a commitment to change the Bill, but I shall look at it and we will return to it at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: have listened carefully to the discussion, but I am not satisfied that I have received an impressive justification from tne Minister or his hon. Friends about the benefits of detention centres and the justification for continuing them indefinitely, as will happen if we put them into the new statute, in spite of the fact that an experiment is in progress of which we are given no statistical information. I have been impressed by the informed speeches of my hon. Friends. The argument was definitely won on this side, so I shall press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
